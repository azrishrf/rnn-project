85 | 18 | 27 | Narrated `Aisha: `Utba (bin Abi Waqqas) said to his brother Sa`d, "The son of the slave girl of Zam`a is my son, so behis custodian." So when it was the year of the Conquest of Mecca, Sa`d took that child and said, "Heis my nephew, and my brother told me to be his custodian." On that, 'Abu bin Zam`a got up and said,'but the child is my brother, and the son of my father's slave girl as he was born on his bed." So theyboth went to the Prophet. Sa`d said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (This is) the son of my brother and he told meto be his custodian." Then 'Abu bin Zam`a said, "(But he is) my brother and the son of the slave girl ofmy father, born on his bed." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "This child is for you. O 'Abu bin Zam`a, as the child isfor the owner of the bed, and the adulterer receives the stones." He then ordered (his wife) Sauda bintZam`a to cover herself before that boy as he noticed the boy's resemblance to `Utba. Since then theboy had never seen Sauda till he died.

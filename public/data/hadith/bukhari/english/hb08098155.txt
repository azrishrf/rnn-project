8 | 98 | 155 | Narrated Nafi`: "The Prophet (ﷺ) used to make his she-camel sit across and he would pray facing it (as a Sutra)." I asked,"What would the Prophet (ﷺ) do if the she-camel was provoked and moved?" He said, "He would take itscamel-saddle and put it in front of him and pray facing its back part (as a Sutra). And Ibn `Umar usedto do the same." (This indicates that one should not pray except behind a Sutra).

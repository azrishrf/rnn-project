59 | 6 | 23 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "If Allah loves a person, He calls Gabriel saying, 'Allah loves so and-so; O Gabriel!Love him.' Gabriel would love him and make an announcement amongst the inhabitants of theHeaven. 'Allah loves so-and-so, therefore you should love him also,' and so all the inhabitants of theHeaven would love him, and then he is granted the pleasure of the people on the earth."

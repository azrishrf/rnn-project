63 | 45 | 136 | Narrated Al-Bara: Abu Bakr bought a (camel's) saddle from `Azib, and I carried it for him. `Azib (i.e. my father) askedAbu Bakr regarding the journey of the migration of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Abu Bakr said, "Close observerswere appointed by our enemies to watch us. So we went out at night and travelled throughout thenight and the following day till it was noon, then we perceived a rock and went towards it, and therewas some shade under it. I spread a cloak I had with me for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and then the Prophet (ﷺ) layedon it. I went out to guard him and all of a sudden I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep looking forthe same, the shade of the rock as we did, I asked him, 'O boy, to whom do you belong?' He replied, 'Ibelong to so-and-so.' I asked him, 'Is there some milk in your sheep?' He replied in the affirmative. Iasked him, 'Will you milk?' He replied in the affirmative. Then he got hold of one of his sheep. I saidto him, 'Remove the dust from its udder.' Then he milked a little milk. I had a water-skin with mewhich was tied with a piece of cloth. I had prepared the water-skin for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . So I pouredsome water over the milk (container) till its bottom became cold. Then I brought the milk to theProphet and said, 'Drink, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) drank till I became pleased. Then wedeparted and the pursuers were following us."

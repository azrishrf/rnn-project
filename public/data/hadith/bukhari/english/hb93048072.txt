93 | 48 | 72 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "There will be three types of people whom Allah will neither speak to them onthe Day of Resurrection nor will purify them from sins, and they will have a painful punishment: Theyare, (1) a man possessed superfluous water (more than he needs) on a way and he withholds it fromthe travelers. (2) a man who gives a pledge of allegiance to an Imam (ruler) and gives it only forworldly benefits, if the Imam gives him what he wants, he abides by his pledge, otherwise he does notfulfill his pledge; (3) and a man who sells something to another man after the `Asr prayer and swearsby Allah (a false oath) that he has been offered so much for it whereupon the buyer believes him andbuys it although in fact, the seller has not been offered such a price."

8 | 58 | 89 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I saw seventy of As-Suffa men and none of them had a Rida' (a garment covering the upper part of thebody). They had either Izars (only) or sheets which they tied round their necks. Some of these sheetsreached the middle of their legs and some reached their heels and they used to gather them with theirhands lest their private parts should become naked.

87 | 32 | 55 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: A Jew whose face had been slapped (by someone), came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "O Muhammad! Aman from your Ansari companions slapped me. " The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Call him". They called him andthe Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, "Why did you slap his face?" He said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! While I was passingby the Jews, I heard him saying, 'By Him Who chose Moses above all the human beings.' I said(protestingly), 'Even above Muhammad?' So I became furious and slapped him." The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Do not give me preference to other prophets, for the people will become unconscious on the Day ofResurrection and I will be the first to gain conscious, and behold, I will Find Moses holding one of thepillars of the Throne (of Allah). Then I will not know whether he has become conscious before me orhe has been exempted because of his unconsciousness at the mountain (during his worldly life) whichhe received."

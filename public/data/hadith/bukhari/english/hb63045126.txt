63 | 45 | 126 | Narrated 'Ata bin Abi Rabah: `Ubaid bin `Umar Al-Laithi and I visited Aisha and asked her about the Hijra (i.e. migration), and shesaid, "Today there is no (Hijrah) emigration. A believer used to run away with his religion to Allahand His Apostle lest he should be put to trial because of his religion. Today Allah has made Islamtriumphant, and today a believer can worship his Lord wherever he likes. But the deeds that are stillrewardable (in place of emigration) are Jihad and good intentions." (See Hadith No. 42 Vol. 4).

92 | 16 | 44 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Sham! O Allah! Bestow Your blessings onour Yemen." The People said, "And also on our Najd." He said, "O Allah! Bestow Your blessings onour Sham (north)! O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen." The people said, "O Allah'sApostle! And also on our Najd." I think the third time the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "There (in Najd) is the placeof earthquakes and afflictions and from there comes out the side of the head of Satan."

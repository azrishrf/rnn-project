3 | 47 | 67 | Narrated `Abdullah: While I was going with the Prophet (ﷺ) through the ruins of Medina and he was reclining on a date-palmleaf stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of them said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about thespirit. Some of them said that they should not ask him that question as he might give a reply whichwould displease them. But some of them insisted on asking, and so one of them stood up and asked,"O Abul-Qasim ! What is the spirit?" The Prophet (ﷺ) remained quiet. I thought he was being inspiredDivinely. So I stayed till that state of the Prophet (while being inspired) was over. The Prophet (ﷺ) thensaid, "And they ask you (O Muhammad) concerning the spirit --Say: The spirit -- its knowledge iswith my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a little)."

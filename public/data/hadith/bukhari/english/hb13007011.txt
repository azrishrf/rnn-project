13 | 7 | 11 | Narrated Ibn Juraij: `Ata' said, "I heard Jabir bin `Abdullah saying, 'The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and startedwith the prayer, and after it he delivered the Khutba. When the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah (p.b.u.h) finished (theKhutba), he went to the women and preached to them, while he was leaning on Bilal's hand. Bilal wasspreading his garment and the ladies were putting alms in it.' " I said to Ata, "Do you think itincumbent upon an Imam to go to the women and preach to them after finishing the prayer andKhutba?" `Ata' said, "No doubt it is incumbent on Imams to do so, and why should they not do so?"

67 | 108 | 159 | Narrated Asma' bint Abu Bakr: When Az-Zubair married me, he had no real property or any slave or anything else except a camelwhich drew water from the well, and his horse. I used to feed his horse with fodder and drew waterand sew the bucket for drawing it, and prepare the dough, but I did not know how to bake bread. Soour Ansari neighbors used to bake bread for me, and they were honorable ladies. I used to carry thedate stones on my head from Zubair's land given to him by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and this land was two thirdFarsakh (about two miles) from my house. One day, while I was coming with the date stones on myhead, I met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with some Ansari people. He called me and then, (directing hiscamel to kneel down) said, "Ikh! Ikh!" so as to make me ride behind him (on his camel). I felt shy totravel with the men and remembered Az-Zubair and his sense of Ghira, as he was one of those peoplewho had the greatest sense of Ghira. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) noticed that I felt shy, so he proceeded. I came toAz-Zubair and said, "I met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while I was carrying a load of date stones on my head, andhe had some companions with him. He made his camel kneel down so that I might ride, but I felt shyin his presence and remembered your sense of Ghira (See the glossary). On that Az-Zubair said, "ByAllah, your carrying the date stones (and you being seen by the Prophet (ﷺ) in such a state) is moreshameful to me than your riding with him." (I continued serving in this way) till Abu Bakr sent me aservant to look after the horse, whereupon I felt as if he had set me free.

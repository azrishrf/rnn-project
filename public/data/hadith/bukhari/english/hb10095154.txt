10 | 95 | 154 | Narrated Jabir bin Samura: Sa`d said, "I used to pray with them a prayer similar to that of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (the prayer of Zuhr and`Asr) reducing nothing from them. I used to prolong the first two rak`at and shorten the last tworak`at." `Umar said to Sa`d "This was what we thought about you."

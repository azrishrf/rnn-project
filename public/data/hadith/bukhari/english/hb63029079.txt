63 | 29 | 79 | Narrated `Abdullah: While the Prophet (ﷺ) was prostrating, surrounded by some of Quraish, `Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait brought theintestines (i.e. Abdominal contents) of a camel and put them over the back of the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ)did not raise his head, (till) Fatima, came and took it off his back and cursed the one who had done theharm. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Allah! Destroy the chiefs of Quraish, Abu Jahl bin Hisham, `Utba binRabi`al, Shaba bin Rabi`a, Umaiya bin Khalaf or Ubai bin Khalaf." (The sub-narrator Shu`ba, is notsure of the last name.) I saw these people killed on the day of Badr battle and thrown in the wellexcept Umaiya or Ubai whose body parts were mutilated but he was not thrown in the well.

83 | 9 | 36 | Narrated Usama: Once a daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent a message to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while Usama, Sa`d, and myfather or Ubai were (sitting there) with him. She said, (in the message); My child is going to die;please come to us." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned the messenger and told him to convey his greetings toher, and say, "Whatever Allah takes, is for Him and whatever He gives is for Him, and everythingwith Him has a limited fixed term (in this world): so she should be patient and hope for Allah'sreward." Then she again sent for him swearing that he should come; so The Prophet (ﷺ) got up, and so didwe. When he sat there (at the house of his daughter), the child was brought to him, and he took himinto his lap while the child's breath was disturbed in his chest. The eyes of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) startedshedding tears. Sa`d said, "What is this, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "This is the mercywhich Allah has lodged in the hearts of whoever He wants of His slaves, and verily Allah is mercifulonly to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).'

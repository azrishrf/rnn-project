76 | 47 | 78 | Narrated `Aisha: A man called Labid bin al-A'sam from the tribe of Bani Zaraiq worked magic on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) tillAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) started imagining that he had done a thing that he had not really done. One day or onenight he was with us, he invoked Allah and invoked for a long period, and then said, "O `Aisha! Doyou know that Allah has instructed me concerning the matter I have asked him about? Two men cameto me and one of them sat near my head and the other near my feet. One of them said to hiscompanion, "What is the disease of this man?" The other replied, "He is under the effect of magic.'The first one asked, 'Who has worked the magic on him?' The other replied, "Labid bin Al-A'sam.'The first one asked, 'What material did he use?' The other replied, 'A comb and the hairs stuck to itand the skin of pollen of a male date palm.' The first one asked, 'Where is that?' The other replied,'(That is) in the well of Dharwan;' " So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with some of his companions went thereand came back saying, "O `Aisha, the color of its water is like the infusion of Henna leaves. The topsof the date-palm trees near it are like the heads of the devils." I asked. "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? Why didyou not show it (to the people)?" He said, "Since Allah cured me, I disliked to let evil spread amongthe people." Then he ordered that the well be filled up with earth.

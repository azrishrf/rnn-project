80 | 17 | 24 | Narrated `Abdullah: We used to say in the prayer: 'AsSalam be on Allah, As-Salam be on so-and so.' So one day theProphet said to us, "Allah Himself is As-Salam; when anyone of you sits during his prayer, he shouldsay: 'at-tah, iyyatu-li l-lahi,' up to 'As-Salihin,' (All the compliments are for Allah ...righteous people)for when he recites this, then he says his Salam to all the righteous people present in the heavens andon the earth. Then he should say, 'I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, andthat Muhammad is His slave and His Apostle,' and then he can select whatever he likes to celebrate(Allah's) Praises."

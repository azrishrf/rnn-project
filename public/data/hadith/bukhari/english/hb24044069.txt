After finishing theprayer, he delivered the sermon and ordered the people to give alms. He said, "O people! Give alms."Then he went towards the women and said. "O women! Give alms, for I have seen that the majority ofthe dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women)." The women asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is thereason for it?" He replied, "O women! You curse frequently, and are ungrateful to your husbands. Ihave not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. O women, some of you canlead a cautious wise man astray." Then he left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife ofIbn Mas`ud, came and asked permission to enter It was said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! It is Zainab." Heasked, 'Which Zainab?" The reply was that she was the wife of Ibn Mas'ub. He said, "Yes, allow herto enter." And she was admitted. Then she said, "O Prophet of Allah! Today you ordered people togive alms and I had an ornament and intended to give it as alms, but Ibn Mas`ud said that he and hischildren deserved it more than anybody else." The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "Ibn Mas`ud had spoken the truth.Your husband and your children had more right to it than anybody else."

8 | 10 | 19 | Narrated Abu Huraira: On the Day of Nahr (10th of Dhul-Hijja, in the year prior to the last Hajj of the Prophet (ﷺ) when AbuBakr was the leader of the pilgrims in that Hajj) Abu Bakr sent me along with other announcers toMina to make a public announcement: "No pagan is allowed to perform Hajj after this year and nonaked person is allowed to perform the Tawaf around the Ka`ba. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent `Ali toread out the Surat Bara'a (at-Tauba) to the people; so he made the announcement along with us on theday of Nahr in Mina: "No pagan is allowed to perform Hajj after this year and no naked person isallowed to perform the Tawaf around the Ka`ba."

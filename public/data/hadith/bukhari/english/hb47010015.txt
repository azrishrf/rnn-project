47 | 10 | 15 | Narrated Sulaiman bin Abu Muslim: I asked Abu Minhal about money exchange from hand to hand. He said, "I and a partner of minebought something partly in cash and partly on credit." Al-Bara' bin `Azib passed by us and we askedabout it. He replied, "I and my partner Zaid bin Al-Arqam did the same and then went to the Prophet (ï·º)and asked him about it. He said, 'Take what was from hand to hand and leave what was on credit.' "

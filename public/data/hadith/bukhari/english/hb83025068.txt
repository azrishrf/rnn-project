Hafsa and I decided that when the Prophet (ﷺ) enteredupon either of us, she would say, "I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin).Have you eaten Maghafir?" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her),"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again."

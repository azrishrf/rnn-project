67 | 33 | 57 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "When Hafsa bint `Umar became a widow after the death of (her husband)Khunais bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi who had been one of the companions of the Prophet, and he died atMedina. I went to `Uthman bin `Affan and presented Hafsa (for marriage) to him. He said, "I willthink it over.' I waited for a few days, then he met me and said, 'It seems that it is not possible for meto marry at present.' " `Umar further said, "I met Abu Bakr As-Siddique and said to him, 'If you wish,I will marry my daughter Hafsa to you." Abu Bakr kept quiet and did not say anything to me in reply.I became more angry with him than with `Uthman. I waited for a few days and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)asked for her hand, and I gave her in marriage to him. Afterwards I met Abu Bakr who said, 'Perhapsyou became angry with me when you presented Hafsa to me and I did not give you a reply?' I said,'Yes.' Abu Bakr said, 'Nothing stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Allah'sApostle had mentioned her, and I never wanted to let out the secret of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). And if Allah'sApostle had refused her, I would have accepted her.' "

96 | 16 | 52 | Narrated Abu Burda: When I arrived at Medina, `Abdullah bin Salam met me and said to me, "Accompany me to my houseso that I may make you drink from a bowl from which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to drink, and that you mayoffer prayer in the mosque in which the Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray." I accompanied him, and he made medrink Sawiq and gave me dates to eat, and then I prayed in his mosque.

91 | 35 | 45 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Men from the companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to see dreams during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)and they used to narrate those dreams to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would interpret them asAllah wished. I was a young man and used to stay in the mosque before my wedlock. I said to myself,"If there were any good in myself, I too would see what these people see." So when I went to bed onenight, I said, "O Allah! If you see any good in me, show me a good dream." So while I was in thatstate, there came to me (in a dream) two angels. In the hand of each of them, there was a mace of iron,and both of them were taking me to Hell, and I was between them, invoking Allah, "O Allah! I seekrefuge with You from Hell." Then I saw myself being confronted by another angel holding a mace ofiron in his hand. He said to me, "Do not be afraid, you will be an excellent man if you only pray moreoften." So they took me till they stopped me at the edge of Hell, and behold, it was built inside like awell and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post there was an angel carrying an ironmace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down with iron chains, and I recognized thereinsome men from the Quraish. Then (the angels) took me to the right side. I narrated this dream to (mysister) Hafsa and she told it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "No doubt, `Abdullah is a goodman." (Nafi` said, "Since then `Abdullah bin `Umar used to pray much.)

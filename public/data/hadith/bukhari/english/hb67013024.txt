67 | 13 | 24 | Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) stayed for three days between Khaibar and Medina, and there he consummated hismarriage to Safiyya bint Huyai. I invited the Muslims to the wedding banquet in which neither meatnor bread was offered. He ordered for leather dining-sheets to be spread, and dates, dried yoghurt andbutter were laid on it, and that was the Prophet's wedding banquet. The Muslims wondered, "Is she(Saffiyya) considered as his wife or his slave girl?" Then they said, "If he orders her to veil herself,she will be one of the mothers of the Believers; but if he does not order her to veil herself, she will bea slave girl. So when the Prophet (ﷺ) proceeded from there, he spared her a space behind him (on his shecamel)and put a screening veil between her and the people.

The people said, "He is one of the people of Paradise." He prayed two lightrak`at and then left. I followed him and said, "When you entered the Mosque, the people said, 'He isone of the people of Paradise.' " He said, "By Allah, one ought not say what he does not know; and Iwill tell you why. In the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ) I had a dream which I narrated to him. I saw as if Iwere in a garden." He then described its extension and greenery. He added: In its center there was aniron pillar whose lower end was fixed in the earth and the upper end was in the sky, and at its upperend there was a (ring-shaped) hand-hold. I was told to climb it. I said, "I can't." "Then a servant cameto me and lifted my clothes from behind and I climbed till I reached the top (of the pillar). Then I gothold of the hand-hold, and I was told to hold it tightly, then I woke up and (the effect of) the handholdwas in my hand. I narrated al I that to the Prophet (ﷺ) who said, 'The garden is Islam, and the handholdis the Most Truth-worthy Hand-Hold. So you will remain as a Muslim till you die." The narratoradded: "The man was `Abdullah bin Salam."

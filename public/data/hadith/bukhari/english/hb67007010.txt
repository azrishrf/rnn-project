Al-Ansari had two wives, so he suggested that `Abdur-Rahman take half, his wives and property. `Abdur-Rahman replied, "May Allah bless you with yourwives and property. Kindly show me the market." So `Abdur-Rahman went to the market and gained(in bargains) some dried yoghurt and some butter. After a few days the Prophet (ﷺ) saw `Abdur-Rahmanwith some yellow stains on his clothes and asked him, "What is that, O `Abdur-Rahman?" He replied,"I had married an Ansari woman." The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, "How much Mahr did you give her?" Hereplied, "The weight of one (date) stone of gold." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Offer a banquet, even with onesheep."

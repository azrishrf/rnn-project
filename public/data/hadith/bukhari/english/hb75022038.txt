75 | 22 | 38 | Narrated `Aisha: When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal had a fever. I entered upon them andsaid, "O my father! How are you? O Bilal! How are you?" Whenever Abu Bakr got the fever he usedto say, "Everybody is staying alive with his people, yet death is nearer to him than his shoe laces."And when fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic verses): "Would that I could stayovernight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of good smellinggrass). Would that one day I could drink of the water of Majinna, and would that Shama and Tafil(two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me!" I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed him aboutthat. He said, "O Allah! Make us love Medina as much or more than we love Mecca, and make ithealthy, and bless its Sa and its Mudd, and take away its fever and put it in Al-Juhfa."

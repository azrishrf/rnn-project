60 | 28 | 77 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "(The Prophet) Moses was a shy person and used to cover his body completelybecause of his extensive shyness. One of the children of Israel hurt him by saying, 'He covers his bodyin this way only because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia, or he has someother defect.' Allah wished to clear Moses of what they said about him, so one day while Moses wasin seclusion, he took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a bath. When he hadfinished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone took his clothes andfled; Moses picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, 'O stone! Give me my garment!' Till hereached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then, and found him the best of what Allah hadcreated, and Allah cleared him of what they had accused him of. The stone stopped there and Mosestook and put his garment on and started hitting the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still hassome traces of the hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in His Saying:-- "Oyou who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed Moses, But Allah proved his innocence of thatwhich they alleged, And he was honorable In Allah's Sight." (33.69)

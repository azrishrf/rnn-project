By Allah, I could not pray (the `Asr) till the sun had set." `Umar told this to theProphet at the time when a fasting person had done Iftar (taken his meals). The Prophet (ﷺ) then went toButhan and I was with him. He performed ablution and offered the `Asr prayer after the sun had setand then the Maghrib prayer.

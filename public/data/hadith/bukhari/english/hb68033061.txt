68 | 33 | 61 | Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair: I asked Ibn `Umar about those who were involved in a case of Lien. He said, "The Prophet (ﷺ) said tothose who were involved in a case of Lien, 'Your accounts are with Allah. One of you two is a liar,and you (the husband) have no right over her (she is divorced)." The man said, 'What about myproperty (Mahr) ?' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'You have no right to get back your property. If you have told thetruth about her then your property was for the consummation of your marriage with her; and if youtold a lie about her, then you are less rightful to get your property back.' " Sufyan, a sub-narrator said:I learned the Hadith from `Amr. Narrated Aiyub: I heard Sa`id bin Jubair saying, "I asked Ibn `Umar,'If a man (accuses his wife for an illegal sexual intercourse and) carries out the process of Lian (whatwill happen)?' Ibn `Umar set two of his fingers apart. (Sufyan set his index finger and middle fingerapart.) Ibn `Umar said, 'The Prophet (ﷺ) separated the couple of Bani Al-Ajlan by divorce and said thrice,"Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent (to Allah)?' "

95 | 1 | 14 | Narrated Malik: We came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and we were young men nearly of equal ages and we stayed with him fortwenty nights. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was a very kind man and when he realized our longing for our families,he asked us about those whom we had left behind. When we informed him, he said, "Go back to yourfamilies and stay with them and teach them (religion) and order them (to do good deeds). The Prophet (ﷺ)mentioned things some of which I remembered and some I did not. Then he said, "Pray as you haveseen me praying, and when it is the time of prayer, one of you should pronounce the call (Adhan) forthe prayer and the eldest of you should lead the prayer. "

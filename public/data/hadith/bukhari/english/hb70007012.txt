70 | 7 | 12 | Narrated Suwaid bin An-Nu`man: We went out with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to Khaibar, and when we were at As-Sahba', (Yahya, a sub-narratorsaid, "As-Sahba' is a place at a distance of one day's journey to Khaibar)." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked thepeople to bring their food, but there was nothing with the people except Sawiq. So we all chewed andate of it. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked for some water and he rinsed his mouth, and we too, rinsed ourmouths. Then he led us in the Maghrib prayer without performing ablution (again).

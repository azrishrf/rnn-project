59 | 16 | 125 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Cover your utensils and tie your water skins, and close your doors and keep yourchildren close to you at night, as the Jinns spread out at such time and snatch things away. When yougo to bed, put out your lights, for the mischief-doer (i.e. the rat) may drag away the wick of the candleand burn the dwellers of the house." Ata said, "The devils." (instead of the Jinns).

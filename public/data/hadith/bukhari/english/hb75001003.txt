75 | 1 | 3 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "The example of a believer is that of a fresh tender plant; from whateverdirection the wind comes, it bends it, but when the wind becomes quiet, it becomes straight again.Similarly, a believer is afflicted with calamities (but he remains patient till Allah removes hisdifficulties.) And an impious wicked person is like a pine tree which keeps hard and straight till Allahcuts (breaks) it down when He wishes."

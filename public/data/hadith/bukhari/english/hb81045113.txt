81 | 45 | 113 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "The first man to be called on the Day of Resurrection will be Adam who will beshown his offspring, and it will be said to them, 'This is your father, Adam.' Adam will say(responding to the call), 'Labbaik and Sa`daik' Then Allah will say (to Adam), 'Take out of youroffspring, the people of Hell.' Adam will say, 'O Lord, how many should I take out?' Allah will say,'Take out ninety-nine out of every hundred." They (the Prophet's companions) said, "O Allah'sApostle! If ninety-nine out of every one hundred of us are taken away, what will remain out of us?"He said, "My followers in comparison to the other nations are like a white hair on a black ox."

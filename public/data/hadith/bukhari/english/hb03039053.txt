3 | 39 | 53 | Narrated 'Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah: Ibn `Abbas said, "When the ailment of the Prophet (ﷺ) became worse, he said, 'Bring for me (writing)paper and I will write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.' But `Umar said, 'TheProphet is seriously ill, and we have got Allah's Book with us and that is sufficient for us.' But thecompanions of the Prophet (ﷺ) differed about this and there was a hue and cry. On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said tothem, 'Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should quarrel in front of me." Ibn`Abbas came out saying, "It was most unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was preventedfrom writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise. (Note: It is apparentfrom this Hadith that Ibn `Abbas had witnessed the event and came out saying this statement. Thetruth is not so, for Ibn `Abbas used to say this statement on narrating the Hadith and he had notwitnessed the event personally.

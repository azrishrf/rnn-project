97 | 50 | 165 | Narrated Shu`ba: Mu'awiya bin Qurra reported that `Abdullah bin Al-Maghaffal Al-Muzani said, "I saw Allah's Messenger (ï·º) on the day of the Conquest of Mecca, riding his she-camel and reciting Surat-al-Fath (48) or part of Surat-al-Fath. He recited it in a vibrating and pleasant voice. Then Mu'awiya recited as `Abdullah bin Mughaffal had done and said, "Were I not afraid that the people would crowd around me, I would surely recite in a vibrating pleasant voice as Ibn Mughaffal did, imitating the Prophet." I asked Muawiya, "How did he recite in that tone?" He said thrice, "A, A , A."

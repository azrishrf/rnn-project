The people praised the deceased. `Umarsaid, "It has been affirmed" (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed by. The people praisedthe deceased. `Umar said, "It has been affirmed." (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passedby. The people praised the deceased. `Umar said, "It has been affirmed (Paradise)." Then a thirdfuneral procession passed by and the people talked badly of the deceased. `Umar said, "It has beenaffirmed (Hell)." I asked `Umar, "O chief of the believers! What has been affirmed?" He said, "I havesaid what the Prophet (ï·º) said. He said, 'Allah will admit into paradise any Muslim whose good characteris attested by four persons.' We asked the Prophet, 'If there were three witnesses only?' He said, 'Eventhree.' We asked, 'If there were two only?' He said, 'Even two.' But we did not ask him about onewitness."

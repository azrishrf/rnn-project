34 | 43 | 62 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "The seller and the buyer have the option of canceling or confirming the dealunless they separate, or one of them says to the other, 'Choose (i.e. decide to cancel or confirm thebargain now)." Perhaps he said, 'Or if it is an optional sale.' " Ibn `Umar, Shuraih, Ash-Shu`bi, Tawus,Ata, and Ibn Abu Mulaika agree upon this judgment.

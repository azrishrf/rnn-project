66 | 22 | 52 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: A lady came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have come to you to offer myself toyou." He raised his eyes and looked at her and then lowered his head. When the lady saw that he didnot make any decision, she sat down. On that, a man from his companions got up and said. "O Allah'sApostle! If you are not in need of this woman, then marry her to me." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Do youhave anything to offer her?" He replied. "No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him,"Go to your family and see if you can find something.' The man went and returned, saying, "No, byAllah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have not found anything." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Try to find something, evenif it is an iron ring.'' He went again and returned, saying, "No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), not evenan iron ring, but I have this waist sheet of mine." The man had no upper garment, so he intended togive her, half his waist sheet. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ''What would she do with your waist sheet? Ifyou wear it, she will have nothing of it over her body, and if she wears it, you will have nothing overyour body." So that man sat for a long period and then got up, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw him goingaway, so he ordered somebody to call him. When he came, the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, " How much of theQur'an do you know?" He replied, "I know such Surat and such Surat and such Surat," and went oncounting it, The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, "Can you recite it by heart?" he replied, "Yes." The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Go, I have married this lady to you for the amount of the Qur'an you know by heart."

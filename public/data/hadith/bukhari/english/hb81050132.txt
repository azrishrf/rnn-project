81 | 50 | 132 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The people were displayed in front of me and I saw one prophet passing by with alarge group of his followers, and another prophet passing by with only a small group of people, andanother prophet passing by with only ten (persons), and another prophet passing by with only five(persons), and another prophet passed by alone. And then I looked and saw a large multitude ofpeople, so I asked Gabriel, "Are these people my followers?' He said, 'No, but look towards thehorizon.' I looked and saw a very large multitude of people. Gabriel said. 'Those are your followers,and those are seventy thousand (persons) in front of them who will neither have any reckoning of theiraccounts nor will receive any punishment.' I asked, 'Why?' He said, 'For they used not to treatthemselves with branding (cauterization) nor with Ruqya (get oneself treated by the recitation of someVerses of the Qur'an) and not to see evil omen in things, and they used to put their trust (only) in theirLord." On hearing that, 'Ukasha bin Mihsan got up and said (to the Prophet), "Invoke Allah to makeme one of them." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Allah, make him one of them." Then another man got up andsaid (to the Prophet), "Invoke Allah to make me one of them." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Ukasha has precededyou."

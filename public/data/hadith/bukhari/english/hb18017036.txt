The time for the prayer became due and he offered the prayerwhile sitting and we prayed while standing. He said, "The Imam is to be followed; so if he saysTakbir, you should also say Takbir, and if he bows you should also bow; and when he lifts his headyou should also do the same and if he says: Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah (Allah hears whoever sendshis praises to Him) you should say: Rabbana walakal-Hamd (O our Lord! All the praises are forYou.")

34 | 83 | 138 | Narrated Sahl bin Abu Hathma: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade the selling of fruits (fresh dates) for dried dates but allowed the sale of fruitson the 'Araya by estimation and their new owners might eat their dates fresh. Sufyan (in anothernarration) said, "I told Yahya (a sub-narrator) when I was a mere boy, 'Meccans say that the Prophet (ﷺ)allowed them the sale of the fruits on 'Araya by estimation.' Yahya asked, 'How do the Meccans knowabout it?' I replied, 'They narrated it (from the Prophet (ﷺ) ) through Jabir.' On that, Yahya kept quiet."Sufyan said, "I meant that Jabir belonged to Medina." Sufyan was asked whether in Jabir's narrationthere was any prohibition of selling fruits before their benefit is evident (i.e. no dangers of being spoiltor blighted). He replied that there was none.

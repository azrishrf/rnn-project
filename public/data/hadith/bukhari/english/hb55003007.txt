55 | 3 | 7 | Narrated Sa`d: I fell sick and the Prophet (ﷺ) paid me a visit. I said to him, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I invoke Allah that Hemay not let me expire in the land whence I migrated (i.e. Mecca)." He said, "May Allah give youhealth and let the people benefit by you." I said, "I want to will my property, and I have only onedaughter and I want to will half of my property (to be given in charity)." He said," Half is too much." Isaid, "Then I will one third." He said, "One-third, yet even one-third is too much." (The narratoradded, "So the people started to will one third of their property and that was Permitted for them.")

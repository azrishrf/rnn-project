61 | 25 | 130 | Narrated Jabir: My father had died in debt. So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "My father (died) leaving unpaid debts,and I have nothing except the yield of his date palms; and their yield for many years will not cover hisdebts. So please come with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me." The Prophet (ﷺ) wentround one of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and saton it and said, "Measure (for them)." He paid them their rights and what remained was as much as hadbeen paid to them.

23 | 94 | 151 | Narrated Hisham's father: Aisha said, "I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he asked me, 'In how many garmentswas the Prophet (ï·º) shrouded?' She replied, 'In three Suhuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and therewas neither a shirt nor a turban among them.' Abu Bakr further asked her, 'On which day did theProphet die?' She replied, 'He died on Monday.' He asked, 'What is today?' She replied, 'Today isMonday.' He added, 'I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.' Then he looked ata garment that he was wearing during his illness and it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, 'Washthis garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.' I said, 'This is worn out.' Hesaid, 'A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for thebody's pus.' He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning."

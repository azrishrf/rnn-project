78 | 95 | 188 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: A bedouin said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Inform me about the emigration." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Waihaka (May Allah be merciful to you)! The question of emigration is a difficult one. Have you got some camels?" The bedouin said, "Yes." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do you pay their Zakat?" He said, "Yes." The Prophet said, "Go on doing like this from beyond the seas, for Allah will not let your deeds go in vain."

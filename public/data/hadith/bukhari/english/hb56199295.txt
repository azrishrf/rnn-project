56 | 199 | 295 | Narrated Muharib bin Dithar: Jabir bin `Abdullah said, "When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived at Medina, he slaughtered a camel or a cow." Jabir added, "The Prophet (ﷺ) bought a camel from me for two Uqiyas (of gold) and one or two Dirhams. When he reached Sirar, he ordered that a cow be slaughtered and they ate its meat. When he arrived at Medina, he ordered me to go to the Mosque and offer two rak`at, and weighed (and gave) me the price of the camel."

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "No, unless you like to offer Nawafil (i.e. optional prayers)."Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then added, "You have to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan." The man said,"Am I to fast any other days?' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "No, unless you wish to observe the optional fastvoluntarily." Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told him about the compulsory Zakat.

96 | 17 | 69 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: That he heard the Prophet, after raising his head from the bowing in morning prayer, saying, "O Allah,our Lord! All the praises are for you." And in the last (rak`a) he said, "O Allah! Curse so-and-so andso--and-so." And then Allah revealed:-- 'Not for you (O Muhammad) is the decision, (but for Allah),whether He turns in mercy to them or punish them, for they are indeed wrongdoers.' (3.128)

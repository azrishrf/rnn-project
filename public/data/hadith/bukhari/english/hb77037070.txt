He said, "I see that you do not touch exceptthe two Yemenite corners of the Ka`ba (while performing the Tawaf): and I see you wearing theSabtiyya shoes; and I see you dyeing (your hair) with Sufra; and I see that when you are in Mecca, thepeople assume the state of Ihram on seeing the crescent (on the first day of Dhul-Hijja) while you donot assume the state of Ihram till the Day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul Hijja)." `Abdullah bin `Umar said tohim, "As for the corners of the Ka`ba, I have not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) touching except the twoYemenite corners, As for the Sabtiyya shoes, I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wearing leather shoes that had nohair, and he used to perform the ablution while wearing them. Therefore, I like to wear such shoes. Asregards dyeing with Sufra, I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) dyeing his hair with it, so I like to dye (my hair) withit. As regards the crescent (of Dhul-Hijja), I have not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) assuming the state of Ihramtill his she-camel set out (on the 8th of Dhul-Hijja).

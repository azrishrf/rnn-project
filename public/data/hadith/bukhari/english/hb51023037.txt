The companions ofthe Prophet (ﷺ) wanted to harm him, but the Prophet (ﷺ) said to them, "Leave him, as the creditor has theright to speak harshly." He then added, "Buy (a camel) of the same age and give it to him." They said,"We cannot get except a camel of an older age than that of his." He said, "Buy it and give it to him, asthe best amongst you is he who pays back his debt in the most handsome way.'

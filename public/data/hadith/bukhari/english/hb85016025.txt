85 | 16 | 25 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Regarding the Holy Verse:--'And to everyone, We have appointed heirs..' And:-- (4.33) 'To those alsoto Whom your right hands have pledged.' (4.33)When the emigrants came to Medina, the Ansar used to be the heir of the emigrants (and vice versa)instead of their own kindred by blood (Dhawl-l-arham), and that was because of the bond ofbrotherhood which the Prophet (ï·º) had established between them, i.e. the Ansar and the emigrants. Butwhen the Divine Verse:--'And to everyone We have appointed heirs,' (4.33) was revealed, it cancelled the other, order i.e. 'Tothose also, to whom Your right hands have pledged.'

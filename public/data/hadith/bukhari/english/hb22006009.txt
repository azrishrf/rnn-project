22 | 6 | 9 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "When the call for prayer is made, Satan takes to his heels passing wind so thathe may not hear the Adhan and when the call is finished he comes back, and when the Iqama ispronounced, Satan again takes to his heels, and when the Iqama is finished he comes back again andtries to interfere with the person and his thoughts and say, "Remember this and that (which he has notthought of before the prayer)", till the praying person forgets how much he has prayed. If anyone ofyou does not remember whether he has offered three or four rak`at then he should perform twoprostrations of Sahu while sitting.

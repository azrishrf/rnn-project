80 | 31 | 52 | Narrated As-Sa'ib bin Yazid: My aunt took me to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! My sister's son is sick." So hepassed his hand over my head and invoked for Allah's blessing upon me and then performed theablution. I drank from the water of his ablution and I stood behind him and looked at his Khatam (theseal of Prophethood) between his shoulders (and its size was) like the button of a tent.

63 | 46 | 151 | Narrated 'Um Al-`Ala: An Ansari woman who gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet (ﷺ) that the Ansar drew lotsconcerning the dwelling of the Emigrants. `Uthman bin Maz'un was decided to dwell with them (i.e.Um Al-`Ala's family), `Uthman fell ill and I nursed him till he died, and we covered him with hisclothes. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) came to us and I (addressing the dead body) said, "O Abu As-Sa'ib, mayAllah's Mercy be on you! I bear witness that Allah has honored you." On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Howdo you know that Allah has honored him?" I replied, "I do not know. May my father and my motherbe sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! But who else is worthy of it (if not `Uthman)?" He said, "Asto him, by Allah, death has overtaken him, and I hope the best for him. By Allah, though I am theApostle of Allah, yet I do not know what Allah will do to me," By Allah, I will never assert the pietyof anyone after him. That made me sad, and when I slept I saw in a dream a flowing stream for`Uthman bin Maz'un. I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and told him of it. He remarked, "That symbolizes his(good) deeds."

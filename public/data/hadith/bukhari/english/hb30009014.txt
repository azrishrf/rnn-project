30 | 9 | 14 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Allah said, 'All the deeds of Adam's sons (people) are for them, except fastingwhich is for Me, and I will give the reward for it.' Fasting is a shield or protection from the fire andfrom committing sins. If one of you is fasting, he should avoid sexual relation with his wife andquarreling, and if somebody should fight or quarrel with him, he should say, 'I am fasting.' By Him inWhose Hands my soul is' The unpleasant smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person isbetter in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. There are two pleasures for the fasting person, oneat the time of breaking his fast, and the other at the time when he will meet his Lord; then he will bepleased because of his fasting."

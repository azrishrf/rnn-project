67 | 106 | 152 | Narrated Asma: Some lady said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! My husband has another wife, so it is sinful of me to claim thathe has given me what he has not given me (in order to tease her)?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, The one whopretends that he has been given what he has not been given, is just like the (false) one who wears twogarments of falsehood."

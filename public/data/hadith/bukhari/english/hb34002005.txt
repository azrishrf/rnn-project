34 | 2 | 5 | Narrated An-Nu`man bin Bashir: The Prophet (ï·º) said "Both legal and illegal things are obvious, and in between them are (suspicious)doubtful matters. So whoever forsakes those doubtful things lest he may commit a sin, will definitelyavoid what is clearly illegal; and whoever indulges in these (suspicious) doubtful things bravely, islikely to commit what is clearly illegal. Sins are Allah's Hima (i.e. private pasture) and whoeverpastures (his sheep) near it, is likely to get in it at any moment."

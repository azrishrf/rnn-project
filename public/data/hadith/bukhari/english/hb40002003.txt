40 | 2 | 3 | Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf: I got an agreement written between me and Umaiya bin Khalaf that Umaiya would look after myproperty (or family) in Mecca and I would look after his in Medina. When I mentioned the word 'Ar64Rahman' in the documents, Umaiya said, "I do not know 'Ar-Rahman.' Write down to me your name,(with which you called yourself) in the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance." So, I wrote my name '`Abdu `Amr'. On the day (of the battle) of Badr, when all the people went to sleep, I went up the hillto protect him. Bilal(1) saw him (i.e. Umaiya) and went to a gathering of Ansar and said, "(Here is)Umaiya bin Khalaf! Woe to me if he escapes!" So, a group of Ansar went out with Bilal to follow us(`Abdur-Rahman and Umaiya). Being afraid that they would catch us, I left Umaiya's son for them tokeep them busy but the Ansar killed the son and insisted on following us. Umaiya was a fat man, andwhen they approached us, I told him to kneel down, and he knelt, and I laid myself on him to protecthim, but the Ansar killed him by passing their swords underneath me, and one of them injured my footwith his sword. (The sub narrator said, " `Abdur-Rahman used to show us the trace of the wound onthe back of his foot.")

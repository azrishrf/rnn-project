77 | 60 | 101 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I was with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in one of the Markets of Medina. He left (the market) and so did I. Then heasked thrice, "Where is the small (child)?" Then he said, "Call Al-Hasan bin `Ali." So Al-Hasan bin`Ali got up and started walking with a necklace (of beads) around his neck. The Prophet (ﷺ) stretchedhis hand out like this, and Al-Hasan did the same. The Prophet (ﷺ) embraced him and said, "0 Allah! llove him, so please love him and love those who love him." Since Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said that. nothinghas been dearer to me than Al-Hasan.

60 | 8 | 31 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "You will be gathered (on the Day of Judgment), bare-footed, naked and notcircumcised." He then recited:--'As We began the first creation, We, shall repeat it: A Promise Wehave undertaken: Truly we shall do it.' (21.104) He added, "The first to be dressed on the Day ofResurrection, will be Abraham, and some of my companions will be taken towards the left side (i.e. tothe (Hell) Fire), and I will say: 'My companions! My companions!' It will be said: 'They renegadefrom Islam after you left them.' Then I will say as the Pious slave of Allah (i.e. Jesus) said. 'And I wasa witness Over them while I dwelt amongst them. When You took me up You were the Watcher overthem, And You are a witness to all things. If You punish them. They are Your slaves And if Youforgive them, Verily you, only You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise." (5.120-121)

50 | 5 | 6 | Narrated `Abdul Wahid bin Aiman: I went to `Aisha and said, "I was the slave of `Utba bin Abu Lahab. "Utba died and his sons becamemy masters who sold me to Ibn Abu `Amr who manumitted me. The sons of `Utba stipulated that myWala' should be for them." `Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and she was given the writing ofemancipation by her masters and she asked me to buy and manumit her. I agreed to it, but Buraira toldme that her masters would not sell her unless her Wala' was for them." `Aisha said, "I am not in needof that." When the Prophet (ﷺ) heard that, or he was told about it, he asked `Aisha about it. `Aishamentioned what Buraira had told her. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Buy and manumit her and let them stipulatewhatever they like." So, `Aisha bought and manumitted her and her masters stipulated that her Wala'should be for them." The Prophet;, said, "The Wala' will be for the liberator even if they stipulated ahundred conditions."

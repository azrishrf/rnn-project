77 | 11 | 17 | Narrated Al-Mughira: One night I was with the Prophet (ï·º) on a journey. He asked (me), "Have you got water with you?" Ireplied, "Yes" So he got down from his she-camel and went away till he disappeared in the darknessof the night. Then he came back and I poured water for him from the pot (for the ablution). He washedhis face and hands while he was wearing a woollen cloak (the sleeves of which were narrow), so hecould not take his arms out of it. So he took them out from underneath the cloak. Then he washed hisforearms and passed his wet hands over his head. Then I tried to take off his Khuffs (socks made fromthick fabric or leather), but he said, "Leave them, for I have performed ablution before putting themon." And so he passed his wet hands over them.

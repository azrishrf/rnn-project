6 | 15 | 23 | Narrated `Aisha: In the last Hajj of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I assumed the Ihram for Hajj along with Allah Apostle. I was one ofthose who intended Tamattu` (to perform Hajj and `Umra) and did not take the Hadi (animal forsacrifice) with me. I got my menses and was not clean till the night of `Arafa I said, "O Allah'sApostle! It is the night of the day of `Arafat and I intended to perform the Hajj Tamattu` with `Umra.Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told me to undo my hair and comb it and to postpone the `Umra. I did the same andcompleted the Hajj. On the night of Al-Hasba (i.e. place outside Mecca where the pilgrims go afterfinishing all the ceremonies of Hajj at Mina) he (the Prophet) ordered `Abdur Rahman (`Aisha's brother)to take me to at-Tan`im to assume the lhram for `Umra in lieu of that of Hajj-at-Tamattu` which I hadintended to perform.

61 | 25 | 99 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I enjoyed the company of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) for three years, and during the other years of my life, neverwas I so anxious to understand the (Prophet's) traditions as I was during those three years. I heard himsaying, beckoning with his hand in this way, "Before the Hour you will fight with people who willhave hairy shoes and live in Al-Bazir." (Sufyan, the sub-narrator once said, "And they are the peopleof Al-Bazir.")

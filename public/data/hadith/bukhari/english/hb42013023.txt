42 | 13 | 23 | Narrated Husain bin `Ali: `Ali bin Abi Talib said: "I got a she-camel as my share of the war booty on the day (of the battle) ofBadr, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave me another she-camel. I let both of them kneel at the door of one ofthe Ansar, intending to carry Idhkhir on them to sell it and use its price for my wedding banquet onmarrying Fatima. A goldsmith from Bani Qainqa' was with me. Hamza bin `Abdul-Muttalib was inthat house drinking wine and a lady singer was reciting: "O Hamza! (Kill) the (two) fat old she camels(and serve them to your guests).So Hamza took his sword and went towards the two she-camels and cut off their humps and openedtheir flanks and took a part of their livers." (I said to Ibn Shihab, "Did he take part of the humps?" Hereplied, "He cut off their humps and carried them away.") `Ali further said, "When I saw that dreadfulsight, I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and told him the news. The Prophet (ﷺ) came out in the company of Zaid binHaritha who was with him then, and I too went with them. He went to Hamza and spoke harshly tohim. Hamza looked up and said, 'Aren't you only the slaves of my forefathers?' The Prophet (ﷺ) retreatedand went out. This incident happened before the prohibition of drinking."

51 | 15 | 24 | Narrated Aisha: Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wanted to go on a journey, he would draw lots as to which of his wiveswould accompany him. He would take her whose name came out. He used to fix for each of them aday and a night. But Sauda bint Zam`a gave up her (turn) day and night to `Aisha, the wife of theProphet in order to seek the pleasure of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (by that action).

10 | 161 | 255 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: One night I slept at the house of my aunt Maimuna and the Prophet (ﷺ) slept (too). He got up (for prayer)in the last hours of the night and performed a light ablution from a hanging leather skin. (`Amr, thesub-narrator described that the ablution was very light). Then he stood up for prayer and I got up tooand performed the ablution in the same way and joined him on his left side. He pulled me to the rightand prayed as much as Allah will. Then he lay down and slept and I heard his breath sounds till theMu'adh-dhin came to him to inform him about the (Fajr) prayer. He left with him for the prayer andprayed without repeating the ablution. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said: We said to `Amr, "Some peoplesay, 'The eyes of the Prophet (ﷺ) sleep but his heart never sleeps.' " `Amr said, "'Ubai bin `Umar said, 'Thedreams of the Prophets are Divine Inspirations. Then he recited, '(O my son), I have seen in dream thatI was slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice).")

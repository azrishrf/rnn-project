61 | 25 | 101 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "The Hour will not be established till you fight a nation wearing hairy shoes, and tillyou fight the Turks, who will have small eyes, red faces and flat noses; and their faces will be like flatshields. And you will find that the best people are those who hate responsibility of ruling most of alltill they are chosen to be the rulers. And the people are of different natures: The best in the pre-lslamicperiod are the best in Islam. A time will come when any of you will love to see me rather than to havehis family and property doubled."

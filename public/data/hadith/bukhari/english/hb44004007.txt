He came out to them raising the curtain of hisroom and addressed Ka`b, "O Ka`b!" Ka`b replied, "Labaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)." (He said to him),"Reduce your debt to one half," gesturing with his hand. Ka`b said, "I have done so, O Allah'sApostle!" On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said to Ibn Abi Hadrad, "Get up and repay the debt, to him."

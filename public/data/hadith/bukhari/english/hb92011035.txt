92 | 11 | 35 | Narrated Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman: The people used to ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about the good but I used to ask him about the evil lest Ishould be overtaken by them. So I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We were living in ignorance and in an(extremely) worst atmosphere, then Allah brought to us this good (i.e., Islam); will there be any evilafter this good?" He said, "Yes." I said, 'Will there be any good after that evil?" He replied, "Yes, butit will be tainted (not pure.)'' I asked, "What will be its taint?" He replied, "(There will be) somepeople who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deedsand disapprove of some others." I asked, "Will there be any evil after that good?" He replied, "Yes,(there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to theircall, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire." I said, "O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe themto us?" He said, "They will be from our own people and will speak our language." I said, "What doyou order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?" He said, "Stick to the group ofMuslims and their Imam (ruler)." I said, "If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?"He said, "Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till deathovertakes you while you are in that state."

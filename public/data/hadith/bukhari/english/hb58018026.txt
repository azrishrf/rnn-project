We were withthe Prophet (ﷺ) on the day of Hudaibiya, and if we had been called to fight, we would have fought. But`Umar bin Al Khatab came and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Aren't we in the right and our opponents inthe wrongs' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Yes.' `Umar said, 'Aren't our killed persons in Paradise and their's inHell?' He said, 'Yes.' `Umar said, 'Then why should we accept hard terms in matters concerning ourreligion? Shall we return before Allah judges between us and them?' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'O Ibn Al-Khattab! I am the Messenger of Allah and Allah will never degrade me. Then `Umar went to Abu Bakrand told him the same as he had told the Prophet.On that Abu Bakr said (to `Umar). 'He is the Messenger of Allah and Allah will never degrade him.' ThenSurat-al-Fath (i.e. Victory) was revealed and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited it to the end in front of `Umar.On that `Umar asked, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Was it (i.e. the Hudaibiya Treaty) a victory?' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)said, "Yes".

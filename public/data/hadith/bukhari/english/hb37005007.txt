37 | 5 | 7 | Narrated Ya`la bin Umaiya: I fought in Jaish-al-Usra (Ghazwa of Tabuk) along with the Prophet (ﷺ) and in my opinion that was thebest of my deeds. Then I had an employee, who quarrel led with someone and one of the them bit andcut the other's finger and caused his own tooth to fall out. He then went to the Prophet (with acomplaint) but the Prophet (ﷺ) canceled the suit and said to the complainant, "Did you expect him to lethis finger in your mouth so that you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?"

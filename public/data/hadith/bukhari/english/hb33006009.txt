33 | 6 | 9 | Narrated `Amra: Aisha said, "the Prophet (ﷺ) used to practice I`tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan and I used to pitch atent for him, and after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the tent." Hafsa asked thepermission of `Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched her tent. When Zainabbint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet (ﷺ) noticed the tents. He said,'What is this?" He was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do you think that theyintended to do righteousness by doing this?" He therefore abandoned the I`tikaf in that month andpracticed I`tikaf for ten days in the month of Shawwal."

If she had left the water ofZamzam (fountain) as it was, (without constructing a basin for keeping the water), (or said, "If she hadnot taken handfuls of its water"), it would have been a flowing stream. Jurhum (an Arab tribe) cameand asked her, 'May we settle at your dwelling?' She said, 'Yes, but you have no right to possess thewater.' They agreed."

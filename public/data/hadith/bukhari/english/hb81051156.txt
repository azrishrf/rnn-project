81 | 51 | 156 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "When the people of Paradise have entered Paradise and the people of the Firehave entered the Fire, death will be brought and will be placed between the Fire and Paradise, andthen it will be slaughtered, and a call will be made (that), 'O people of Paradise, no more death ! Opeople of the Fire, no more death ! ' So the people of Paradise will have happiness added to theirprevious happiness, and the people of the Fire will have sorrow added to their previous sorrow."

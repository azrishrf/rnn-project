10 | 96 | 156 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi Qatada: My father said, "The Prophet (ﷺ) in Zuhr prayers used to recite Al-Fatiha along with two other Suras inthe first two rak`at: a long one in the first rak`a and a shorter (Sura) in the second, and at times theverses were audible. In the `Asr prayer the Prophet (ﷺ) used to recite Al-Fatiha and two more Suras in thefirst two rak`at and used to prolong the first rak`a. And he used to prolong the first rak`a of the Fajrprayer and shorten the second.

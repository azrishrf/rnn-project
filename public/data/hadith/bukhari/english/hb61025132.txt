61 | 25 | 132 | Narrated Sa`id Al-Umawi: I was with Marwan and Abu Huraira and heard Abu Huraira saying, "I heard the trustworthy, trulyinspired one (i.e. the Prophet (ï·º) ) saying, 'The destruction of my followers will be brought about by thehands of some youngsters from Quraish." Marwan asked, "Youngsters?" Abu Huraira said, "If youwish, I would name them: They are the children of so-and-so and the children of so-and-so."

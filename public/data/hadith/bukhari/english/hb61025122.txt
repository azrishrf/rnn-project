61 | 25 | 122 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in his fatal illness came out, wrapped with a sheet, and his head was wrapped with anoiled bandage. He sat on the pulpit, and praising and glorifying Allah, he said, "Now then, people willincrease but the Ansar will decrease in number, so much so that they, compared with the people, willbe just like the salt in the meals. So, if any of you should take over the authority by which he caneither benefit some people or harm some others, he should accept the goodness of their good people(i.e. Ansar) and excuse the faults of their wrong-doers." That was the last gathering which the Prophet (ﷺ)attended.

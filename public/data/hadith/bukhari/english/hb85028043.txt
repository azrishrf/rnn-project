85 | 28 | 43 | Narrated `Aisha: Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas and 'Abu bin Zam`a had a dispute over a boy. Sa`d said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!This (boy) is the son of my brother, `Utba bin Abi Waqqas who told me to be his custodian as he washis son. Please notice to whom he bears affinity." And 'Abu bin Zam`a said, "This is my brother, OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He was born on my father's bed by his slave girl." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) looked at the boyand noticed evident resemblance between him and `Utba, so he said, "He (the toy) is for you, O 'Abubin Zam`a, for the boy is for the owner of the bed, and the stone is for the adulterer. Screen yourselfbefore the boy, O Sauda bint Zam`a." `Aisha added: Since then he had never seen Sauda.

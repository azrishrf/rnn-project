A manfrom Quraish came to him and said, "Appoint your successor." `Uthman asked, "Did the people namehim? (i.e. the successor) the man said, "Yes." `Uthman asked, "Who is that?" The man remainedsilent. Another man came to `Uthman and I think it was Al-Harith. He also said, "Appoint yoursuccessor." `Uthman asked, "Did the people name him?" The man replied "Yes." `Uthman said, "Whois that?" The man remained silent. `Uthman said, "Perhaps they have mentioned Az-Zubair?" The mansaid, "Yes." `Uthman said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, he is the best of them as I know, andthe dearest of them to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) ."

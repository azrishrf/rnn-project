96 | 18 | 70 | Narrated `Ali bin Abi Talib: That Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to him and Fatima the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at their house at nightand said, "Won't you pray?" `Ali replied, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Our souls are in the Hands of Allah andwhen he wants us to get up, He makes us get up." When `Ali said that to him, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) leftwithout saying anything to him. While the Prophet (ﷺ) was leaving, `Ali heard him striking his thigh (withhis hand) and saying, "But man is quarrelsome more than anything else." (18.54)

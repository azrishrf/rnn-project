I replied, "I apprehended the approaching dawn so I dismountedand prayed the witr prayer." `Abdullah said, "Isn't it sufficient for you to follow the good example ofAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" I replied, "Yes, by Allah." He said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to pray witr on the back ofthe camel (while on a journey)."

'Abu bin Zam's got up and said, "He is my brother and the son ofthe slave girl of my father and was born on my father's bed." Then both of them came to Allah'sApostle and Sa`d said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted tome."Then 'Abu bin Zam`a got up and said, "This is my brother and the son of the slave-girl of my father."Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "O Abu bin Zam`a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where hewas born), and for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation)." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to his wifeSauda bint Zam`a, "Screen yourself from this boy," when he saw the boy's resemblance to `Utba.Since then the boy did not see Sauda till he died.

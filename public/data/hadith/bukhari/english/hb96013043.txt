96 | 13 | 43 | Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba: `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked (the people) about the Imlas of a woman, i.e., a woman who has anabortion because of having been beaten on her `Abdomen, saying, "Who among you has heardanything about it from the Prophet?" I said, "I did.'' He said, "What is that?" I said, "I heard theProphet saying, "Its Diya (blood money) is either a male or a female slave.' " `Umar said, "Do notleave till you present witness in support of your statement." So I went out, and found Muhammad binMaslama. I brought him, and he bore witness with me that he had heard the Prophet (ï·º) saying, "Its Diya(blood money) is either a male slave or a female slave."

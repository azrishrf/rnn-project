73 | 11 | 16 | Narrated Al-Bara': I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) delivering a sermon, and he said (on the Day of `Id-Allah. a), "The first thing wewill do on this day of ours is that we will offer the `Id prayer, then we will return and slaughter oursacrifices; and whoever does so, then indeed he has followed our tradition, and whoever slaughteredhis sacrifice (before the prayer), what he offered was just meat that he presented to his family, and thatwas not a sacrifice." Abu Burda got up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I slaughtered the sacrifice beforethe prayer and I have got a Jadha'a which is better than an old sheep." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Slaughter itto make up for that, but it will not be sufficient for anybody else after you."

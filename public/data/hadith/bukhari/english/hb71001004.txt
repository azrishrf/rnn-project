71 | 1 | 4 | Narrated Asma' bint Abu Bakr: I conceived `Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to givebirth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba', and gave birth at Quba'. Then I brought the child toAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in themouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Then hedid its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Allah to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamicera, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the Jewshad bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.

67 | 3 | 4 | Narrated `Abdullah: We were with the Prophet (ﷺ) while we were young and had no wealth whatever. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said,"O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gazeand guard his modesty (i.e. his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), andwhoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power."

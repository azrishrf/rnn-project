93 | 21 | 35 | Narrated Abu Qatada: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said on the Day of (the battle of) Hunain, "Whoever has killed an infidel and has aproof or a witness for it, then the salb (arms and belongings of that deceased) will be for him." I stoodup to seek a witness to testify that I had killed an infidel but I could not find any witness and then satdown. Then I thought that I should mention the case to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I (and when I did so) a manfrom those who were sitting with him said, "The arms of the killed person he has mentioned, are withme, so please satisfy him on my behalf." Abu Bakr said, "No, he will not give the arms to a bird ofQuraish and deprive one of Allah's lions of it who fights for the cause of Allah and His Apostle."Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I stood up and gave it to me, and I bought a garden with its price, and that was myfirst property which I owned through the war booty.The people of Hijaz said, "A judge should not pass a judgment according to his knowledge, whetherhe was a witness at the time he was the judge or before that" And if a litigant gives a confession infavor of his opponent in the court, in the opinion of some scholars, the judge should not pass ajudgment against him till the latter calls two witnesses to witness his confession. And some people ofIraq said, "A judge can pass a judgement according to what he hears or witnesses (the litigant'sconfession) in the court itself, but if the confession takes place outside the court, he should not passthe judgment unless two witnesses witness the confession." Some of them said, "A judge can pass ajudgement depending on his knowledge of the case as he is trust-worthy, and that a witness isRequired just to reveal the truth. The judge's knowledge is more than the witness." Some said, "Ajudge can judge according to his knowledge only in cases involving property, but in other cases hecannot." Al-Qasim said, "A judge ought not to pass a judgment depending on his knowledge if otherpeople do not know what he knows, although his knowledge is more than the witness of somebodyelse because he might expose himself to suspicion by the Muslims and cause the Muslims to haveunreasonable doubt.

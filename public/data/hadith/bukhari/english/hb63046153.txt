63 | 46 | 153 | Narrated `Aisha: When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal got fever, and I went to both of them andsaid, "O my father, how do you feel? O Bilal, how do you feel?" Whenever Abu Bakr's fever gotworse, he would say, "Every man will meet his death once in one morning while he will be among hisfamily, for death is really nearer to him than his leather shoe laces (to his feet)." And whenever feverdeserted Bilal, he would say aloud, "Would that I know whether I shall spend a night in the valley (ofMecca) with Idhkhir and Jalil (i.e. kinds of grass) around me, and whether I shall drink one day thewater of Mijannah, and whether I shall see once again the hills of Shamah and Tafil?" Then I went toAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and told him of that. He said, "O Allah, make us love Medina as much as or more thanwe used to love Mecca, O Allah, make it healthy and bless its Sa' and Mud (i.e. measures), and takeaway its fever to Al-Juhfa."

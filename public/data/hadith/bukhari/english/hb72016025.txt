Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) presented a dish of meat (thathad been offered to him by the pagans) to Zaid bin `Amr, but Zaid refused to eat of it and then said (tothe pagans), "I do not eat of what you slaughter on your stonealtars (Ansabs) nor do I eat except thaton which Allah's Name has been mentioned on slaughtering."

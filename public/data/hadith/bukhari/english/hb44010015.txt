Iwent to him to demand it, but he said to me, "I will not pay you unless you reject faith inMuhammad." I replied, "By Allah, I will never disbelieve Muhammad till Allah let you die and thenresurrect you." He said, "Then wait till I die and come to life again, for then I will be given propertyand offspring and will pay your right." So, thus revelation came: "Have you seen him who disbelievedin Our signs and yet says, 'I will be given property and offspring?' " (19.77)

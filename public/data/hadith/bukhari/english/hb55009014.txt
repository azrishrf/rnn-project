55 | 9 | 14 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "All of you are guardians and responsible for your charges: the Ruler(i.e. Imam) is a guardian and responsible for his subjects; and a man is a guardian of his family and isresponsible for his charges; and a lady is a guardian in the house of her husband and is responsible forher charge; and a servant is a guardian of the property of his master and is responsible for his charge."I think he also said, "And a man is a guardian of the property of his father."

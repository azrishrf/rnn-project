58 | 18 | 27 | Narrated Al-A`mash: I asked Abu Wail, "Did you take part in the battle of Siffin?" He said, 'Yes, and I heard Sahl binHunaif (when he was blamed for lack of zeal for fighting) saying, "You'd better blame your wrongopinions. I wish you had seen me on the day of Abu Jandal. If I had the courage to disobey theProphet's orders, I would have done so. We had kept out swords on our necks and shoulders, for athing which frightened us. And we did so, we found it easier for us, except in the case of the abovebattle (of ours).' "

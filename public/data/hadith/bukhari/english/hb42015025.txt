42 | 15 | 25 | Narrated Anas (ra): The Prophet (ﷺ) called the Ansar so as to grant them a portion of (the land of) Bahrain. They said, "O Allah's Messenger ! If you grant this to is, write a similar document on our Quraish (emigrant) brothers." But the Prophet (ﷺ) did not have enough grants and he said: "After me you will see the people giving preference (to others), so be patient till you meet me."

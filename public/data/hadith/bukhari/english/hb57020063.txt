57 | 20 | 63 | Narrated Ibn Abi `Aufa: We were afflicted with hunger during the besiege of Khaibar, and when it was the day of (the battleof) Khaibar, we slaughtered the donkeys and when the pots got boiling (with their meat). Allah'sApostle made an announcement that all the pots should be upset and that nobody should eat anythingof the meat of the donkeys. We thought that the Prophet (ï·º) prohibited that because the Khumus had notbeen taken out of the booty (i.e. donkeys); other people said, "He prohibited eating them for ever."The sub-narrator added, "I asked Sa`id bin Jubair who said, 'He has made the eating of donkeys' meatillegal for ever.")

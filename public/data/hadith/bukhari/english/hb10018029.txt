When he realized our longing for ourfamilies, he asked about our homes and the people there and we told him. Then he asked us to go backto our families and stay with them and teach them (the religion) and to order them to do good things.He also mentioned some other things which I have (remembered or [??] ) forgotten. The Prophet (ﷺ) thenadded, "Pray as you have seen me praying and when it is the time for the prayer one of you shouldpronounce the Adhan and the oldest of you should lead the prayer.

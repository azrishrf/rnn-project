He said, "If you hit the game with its sharp edge, eat it, but ifthe Mi'rad hits the game with its shaft with a hit by its broad side do not eat it, for it has been beaten todeath with a piece of wood. (i.e. unlawful)." I asked, "If I let loose my trained hound after a game?"He said, "If you let loose your trained hound after game, and mention the name of Allah, then you caneat." I said, "If the hound eats of the game?" He said "Then you should not eat of it, for the hound hashunted the game for itself and not for you." I said, "Some times I send my hound and then I find someother hound with it?" He said "Don't eat the game, as you have mentioned the Name of Allah on yourdog only and not on the other."

21 | 10 | 12 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) once offered the prayer and said, "Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt myprayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying himto one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered thestatement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to anyother after me.' Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."

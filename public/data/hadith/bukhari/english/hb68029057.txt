68 | 29 | 57 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi: Uwaimir Al-Ajlani came to `Asim bin Ad Al-Ansari and said to him, "O `Asim! Suppose a man sawanother man with his wife, would he kill him whereupon you would kill him; or what should he do?Please, O `Asim, ask about this on my behalf." `Asim asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ),disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What `Asim heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was hardon him. When `Asim returned to his family, 'Uwaimir came to him and said, "O `Asim! What didAllah's Messenger (ﷺ). say to you?" `Asim said to 'Uwaimir, "You never bring me any good. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)disliked the problem which I asked him about." 'Uwaimir said, "By Allah, I will not give up thismatter until I ask the Prophet (ﷺ) about it." So 'Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in themidst of people, and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If a man sees another man with his wife, would he killhim, whereupon you would kill him, or what should he do?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Allah has revealedsome decree as regards you and your wives case. Go and bring her." So they carried out the process ofLian while I was present among the people with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). When they had finished their Lian,'Uwaimir said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If I should now keep her with me as a wife, then I have told a lie."So he divorced her thrice before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered him. (Ibn Shihab said: So divorce was thetradition for all those who were involved in a case of Lian.)

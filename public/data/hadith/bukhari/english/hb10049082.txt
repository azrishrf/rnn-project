10 | 49 | 82 | Narrated Malik bin Huwairith: We went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and we were all young men and stayed with him for about twenty nights. TheProphet (ﷺ) was very merciful. He said, "When you return home, impart religious teachings to yourfamilies and tell them to offer perfectly such and such a prayer at such and such a time and such andsuch a prayer at such and such a time. And at the time of the prayer one of you should pronounce theAdhan and the oldest of you should lead the prayer."

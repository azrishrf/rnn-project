So they went and drankit, and when they became healthy, they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. This newsreached the Prophet (ﷺ) early in the morning, so he sent (some) men in their pursuit and they werecaptured and brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) before midday. He ordered to cut off their hands and legs andtheir eyes to be branded with heated iron pieces and they were thrown at Al-Harra, and when theyasked for water to drink, they were not given water. (Abu Qilaba said, "Those were the people whocommitted theft and murder and reverted to disbelief after being believers (Muslims), and foughtagainst Allah and His Apostle").

57 | 19 | 54 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: When Allah favored His Apostle with the properties of Hawazin tribe as Fai (booty), he started givingto some Quarries men even up to one-hundred camels each, whereupon some Ansari men said aboutAllah's Messenger (ﷺ), "May Allah forgive His Apostle! He is giving to (men of) Quraish and leaves us, inspite of the fact that our swords are still dropping blood (of the infidels)" When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wasinformed of what they had said, he called the Ansar and gathered them in a leather tent and did notcall anybody else along, with them. When they gathered, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to them and said,"What is the statement which, I have been informed, and that which you have said?" The learned onesamong them replied," O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The wise ones amongst us did not say anything, but theyoungsters amongst us said, 'May Allah forgive His Apostle; he gives the Quarish and leaves theAnsar, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dribbling (wet) with the blood of the infidels.' "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, I give to such people as are still close to the period of Infidelity (i.e. they haverecently embraced Islam and Faith is still weak in their hearts). Won't you be pleased to see people gowith fortune, while you return with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to your houses? By Allah, what you will returnwith, is better than what they are returning with." The Ansar replied, "Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), we aresatisfied' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to them." You will find after me, others being preferred to you. Thenbe patient till you meet Allah and meet His Apostle at Al-Kauthar (i.e. a fount in Paradise)." (Anasadded:) But we did not remain patient.

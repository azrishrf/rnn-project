62 | 5 | 20 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "While I was sleeping, I saw myself standing at a well, on it there wasa bucket. I drew water from the well as much as Allah wished. Then Ibn Abi Quhafa (i.e. Abu Bakr)took the bucket from me and brought out one or two buckets (of water) and there was weakness in hisdrawing the water. May Allah forgive his weakness for him. Then the bucket turned into a very bigone and Ibn Al-Khattab took it over and I had never seen such a mighty person amongst the people ashim in performing such hard work, till the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camelsthat knelt down there."

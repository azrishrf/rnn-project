66 | 11 | 33 | Narrated Al-Bara': A man was reciting Surat Al-Kahf and his horse was tied with two ropes beside him. A cloud camedown and spread over that man, and it kept on coming closer and closer to him till his horse startedjumping (as if afraid of something). When it was morning, the man came to the Prophet, and told himof that experience. The Prophet (ï·º) said, "That was As-Sakina (tranquility) which descended because of(the recitation of) the Qur'an."

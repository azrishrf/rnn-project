87 | 7 | 19 | Narrated Anas: A Jew killed a girl so that he may steal her ornaments. He struck her with a stone, and she wasbrought to the Prophet (ﷺ) while she was still alive. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked her, "Did such-and-such personstrike you?" She gestured with her head, expressing denial. He asked her for the second time, and sheagain gestured with her head, expressing denial. When he asked her for the third time, she beckoned,"Yes." So the Prophet (ﷺ) killed him (the Jew) with two stones.

Send (famine) years on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famineduring the time) of (Prophet) Joseph." So famine overtook them for one year and destroyed every kindof life to such an extent that the people started eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals.Whenever one of them looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke because ofhunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "O Muhammad! You order people to obey Allahand to keep good relations with kith and kin. No doubt the people of your tribe are dying, so pleasepray to Allah for them." So Allah revealed: "Then watch you For the day that The sky will bring fortha kind Of smoke Plainly visible ... Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shallseize You with a mighty grasp.

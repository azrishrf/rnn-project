83 | 15 | 51 | Narrated Jundub: Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib that once he had a guest, so he told hisfamily (on the Day of Id-ul-Adha) that they should slaughter theanimal for sacrifice before he returned from the ('Id) prayer in orderthat their guest could take his meal. So his family slaughtered (theanimal ) before the prayer. Then they mentioned that event to theProphet who ordered Al-Bara to slaughter another sacrifice. Al-Bara'said to the Prophet (ï·º) , "I have a young milch she-goat which is betterthan two sheep for slaughtering." (The sub-narrator, Ibn 'Aun used tosay, "I don't know whether the permission (to slaughter a she-goat asa sacrifice) was especially given to Al-Bara' or if it was in generalfor all the Muslims.")

He said, "Make public announcement of it for oneyear, then remember the description of its container and the string it is tied with, utilize the money,and if its owner comes back after that, give it to him." The people asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Whatabout a lost sheep?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Take it, for it is for you, for your brother, or for the wolf."The man asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What about a lost camel?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got angry and hischeeks or face became red, and said, "You have no concern with it as it has its feet, and its watercontainer,till its owner finds it."

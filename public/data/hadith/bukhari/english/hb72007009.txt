72 | 7 | 9 | Narrated Adi bin Hatim: I asked Allah's Messenger (ï·º). "We hunt with the help of these hounds." He said, "If you let loose yourtrained hounds after a game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat what the hounds catchfor you, even if they killed the game. But you should not eat of it if the hound has eaten of it, for thenit is likely that the hound has caught the game for itself. And if other hounds join your hound inhunting the game, then do not eat of it."

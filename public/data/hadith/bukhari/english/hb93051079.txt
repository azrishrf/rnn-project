93 | 51 | 79 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: That he heard `Umar's second speech he delivered when he sat on the pulpit on the day following thedeath of the Prophet (ﷺ) `Umar recited the Tashahhud while Abu Bakr was silent. `Umar said, "I wish thatAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) had outlived all of us, i.e., had been the last (to die). But if Muhammad is dead, Allahnevertheless has kept the light amongst you from which you can receive the same guidance as Allahguided Muhammad with that. And Abu Bakr is the companion of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) He is the second ofthe two in the cave. He is the most entitled person among the Muslims to manage your affairs.Therefore get up and swear allegiance to him." Some people had already taken the oath of allegianceto him in the shed of Bani Sa`ida but the oath of allegiance taken by the public was taken at the pulpit.I heard `Umar saying to Abu Bakr on that day. "Please ascend the pulpit," and kept on urging him tillhe ascended the pulpit whereupon, all the people swore allegiance to him.

51 | 3 | 4 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu Qatada Al-Aslami: That his father said, "One day I was sitting with some of the Prophet's companions on the way toMecca. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was ahead of us. All of my companions were in the state of Ihram while I wasa non-Muhrim. They saw an onager while I was busy repairing my shoes, so they did not tell me aboutit but they wished I had seen it. By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled itand rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand over to methe whip and the spear but they said, 'No, by Allah, we shall not help you in that in any way.' I becameangry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things and rode the horse again. I attacked theonager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) andstarted eating it, but they doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in thestate of Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)and asked him about the case, he asked, 'Do you have a portion of it with you?' I replied in theaffirmative and gave him that fleshy foreleg which he ate completely while he was in the state ofIhram .

He said, "Allah has said, 'In this morning some of my slavesremained as true believers and some became non-believers; whoever said that the rain was due to theBlessings and the Mercy of Allah had belief in Me and he disbelieves in the stars, and whoever saidthat it rained because of a particular star had no belief in Me but believes in that star.'

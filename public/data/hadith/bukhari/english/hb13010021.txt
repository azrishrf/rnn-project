13 | 10 | 21 | Narrated Al-Bara': The Prophet (ﷺ) delivered the Khutba on the day of Nahr (`Id-ul-Adha) and said, "The first thing weshould do on this day of ours is to pray and then return and slaughter (our sacrifices). So anyone whodoes so he acted according to our Sunna; and whoever slaughtered before the prayer then it was justmeat that he offered to his family and would not be considered as a sacrifice in any way. My uncleAbu Burda bin Niyyar got up and said, "O, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I slaughtered the sacrifice before theprayer but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Slaughterit in lieu of the first and such a goat will not be considered as a sacrifice for anybody else after you."

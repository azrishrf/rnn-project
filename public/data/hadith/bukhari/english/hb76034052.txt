A man from those staying near thewater, came and said to the companions of the Prophet, "Is there anyone among you who can doRuqya as near the water there is a person who has been stung by a scorpion." So one of the Prophet'scompanions went to him and recited Surat-al-Fatiha for a sheep as his fees. The patient got cured andthe man brought the sheep to his companions who disliked that and said, "You have taken wages forreciting Allah's Book." When they arrived at Medina, they said, ' O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (This person) hastaken wages for reciting Allah's Book" On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "You are most entitled to takewages for doing a Ruqya with Allah's Book."

8 | 90 | 142 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Once I came riding a she-ass when I had just attained the age of puberty. Allah's Messenger (ï·º) was offeringthe prayer at Mina with no wall in front of him and I passed in front of some of the row. There Idismounted and let my she-ass loose to graze and entered the row and nobody objected to me about it.

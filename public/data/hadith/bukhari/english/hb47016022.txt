47 | 16 | 22 | Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa: My grandfather, Rafi` bin Khadij said, "We were in the valley of Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in thecompany of the Prophet (ﷺ) and had some camels and sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (inslaughtering the animals) and put their meat in the pots and started cooking. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came andordered them to upset the pots, and distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep.One of the camels fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got worried. (The camel waschased and) a man slopped the camel by throwing an arrow at it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Some of theseanimals are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your control, then you shouldtreat it as you have done now.' " My grandfather said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We fear that we may meetour enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we slaughter the animals with reeds?" The Prophet (ﷺ)said, "Yes, or you can use what would make blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what isslaughtered and the Name of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don't use teeth orfingernails (in slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are usedby Ethiopians for slaughtering. (See Hadith 668)

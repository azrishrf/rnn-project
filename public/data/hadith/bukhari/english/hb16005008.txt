16 | 5 | 8 | Narrated Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) On the day when the sun Khasafat (eclipsed) Allah's Messenger (ï·º) prayed; hestood up and said Takbir and recited a prolonged recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing,then he raised his head and said, "Sami`a l-lahu Lyman Hamidah," and then remained standing andrecited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowingwhich was shorter than the first. Then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration and he did the samein the second rak`a as in the first and then finished the prayer with Taslim. By that time the sun(eclipse) had cleared He addressed the people and said, "The sun and the moon are two of the signs ofAllah; they do not eclipse (Yakhsifan) because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. So whenyou see them make haste for the prayer."

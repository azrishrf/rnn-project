51 | 19 | 33 | Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) distributed some cloaks but did not give anything thereof to Makhrama. Makhramasaid (to me), "O son! accompany me to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)." When I went with him, he said, "Call him tome." I called him (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) for my father. He came out wearing one of those cloaks and said,"We kept this (cloak) for you, (Makhrama)." Makhrama looked at the cloak and said, "Makhrama ispleased," (or the Prophet (ﷺ) said), "Is Makhrama pleased?"

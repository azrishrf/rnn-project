86 | 42 | 76 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade Al-Wisal (fasting continuously for more than one day without taking anymeals). A man from the Muslims said, "But you do Al-Wisal, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Isaid, "Who among you is similar to me? I sleep and my Lord makes me eat and drink." When thepeople refused to give up Al-Wisal, the Prophet (ﷺ) fasted along with them for one day, and did not breakhis fast but continued his fast for another day, and when they saw the crescent, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Ifthe crescent had not appeared, I would have made you continue your fast (for a third day)," as if hewanted to punish them for they had refused to give up Al-Wisal.

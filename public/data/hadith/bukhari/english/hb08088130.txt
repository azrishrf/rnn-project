8 | 88 | 130 | Narrates Ibn Seereen: Abu Huraira said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) led us in one of the two `Isha' prayers (Abu Huraira named thatprayer but I forgot it)." Abu Huraira added, "He prayed two rak`at and then finished the prayer withTaslim. He stood up near a piece of wood Lying across the mosque and leaned on it in such a way asif he was angry. Then he put his right hand over the left and clasped his hands by interlacing hisfingers and then put his J right cheek on the back of his left hand. The people who were in haste leftthe mosque through its gates. They wondered whether the prayer was reduced. And amongst themwere Abu Bakr and `Umar but they hesitated to ask the Prophet. A long-handed man called Dhul-Yadain asked the Prophet, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you forgotten or has the prayer been reduced?'The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, 'I have neither forgotten nor has the prayer been reduced' The Prophet (ﷺ) added, 'Iswhat Dhul Yadain has said true?' They (the people) said, 'Yes, it is true.' The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up againand led the prayer, completing the remaining prayer, forgotten by him, and performed Taslim, andthen said, 'Allahu Akbar.' And then he did a prostration as he used to prostrate or longer than that. Hethen raised his head saying, 'Allahu Akbar; he then again said, 'Allahu Akbar', and prostrated as heused to prostrate or longer than that. Then he raised his head and said, 'Allahu Akbar.' " (The subnarratoradded, "I think that they asked (Ibn Seereen) whether the Prophet (ﷺ) completed the prayer withTaslim. He replied, "I heard that `Imran bin Husain had said, 'Then he (the Prophet) did Taslim.")

83 | 33 | 84 | Narrated Abu Huraira: We went out in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the day of (the battle of) Khaibar, and we did notget any gold or silver as war booty, but we got property in the form of things and clothes. Then a mancalled Rifa`a bin Zaid, from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dubaib, presented a slave named Mid`am to Allah'sApostle. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) headed towards the valley of Al-Qura, and when he was in the valley of Al-Qura an arrow was thrown by an unidentified person, struck and killed Mid`am who was making ashe-camel of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kneel down. The people said, "Congratulations to him (the slave) forgaining Paradise." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "No! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, for the sheet whichhe stole from the war booty before its distribution on the day of Khaibar, is now burning over him."When the people heard that, a man brought one or two Shiraks (leather straps of shoes) to the Prophet.The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A Shirak of fire, or two Shiraks of fire."

81 | 18 | 56 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Once Allah's Messenger (ï·º) led us in prayer and then (after finishing it) ascended the pulpit and pointed withhis hand towards the Qibla of the mosque and said, "While I was leading you in prayer, both Paradiseand Hell were displayed in front of me in the direction of this wall. I had never seen a better thing(than Paradise) and a worse thing (than Hell) as I have seen today, I had never seen a better thing anda worse thing as I have seen today."

63 | 51 | 164 | Narrated Abu Al-Minhal `AbdurRahman bin Mut`im: A partner of mine sold some Dirhams on credit in the market. I said, "Glorified be Allah! Is thislegal?" He replied, "Glorified be Allah! By Allah, when I sold them in the market, nobody objected toit." Then I asked Al-Bara' bin `Azib (about it) he said, "We used to make such a transaction when theProphet came to Medina. So he said, 'There is no harm in it if it is done from hand to hand, but it isnot allowed on credit.' Go to Zaid bin Al- Arqam and ask him about it for he was the greatest trader ofall of us." So I asked Zaid bin Al-Arqam., and he said the same (as Al-Bara) did."

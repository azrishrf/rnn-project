8 | 71 | 106 | Narrated Ka`b: In the mosque l asked Ibn Abi Hadrad to pay the debts which he owed to me and our voices grewlouder. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard that while he was in his house. So he came to us raising the curtain ofhis room and said, "O Ka`b!" I replied, "Labaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" He said, "O Ka`b! reduce yourdebt to one half," gesturing with his hand. I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have done so." Then Allah'sApostle said (to Ibn Abi Hadrad), "Get up and pay the debt to him."

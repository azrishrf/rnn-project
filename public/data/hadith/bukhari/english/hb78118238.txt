78 | 118 | 238 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Once I stayed overnight at the house of Maimuna and the Prophet (ﷺ) was there with her. When it was the last third of the night, or some part of the night, the Prophet (ﷺ) got up looking towards the sky and recited: 'Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of Night and Day, there are indeed signs for men of u understanding.' (3.190)

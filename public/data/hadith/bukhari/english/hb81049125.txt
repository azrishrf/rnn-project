He then turned his face aside (as if he were lookingat it) and said again, "Protect yourself from the Fire," and then turned his face aside (as if he werelooking at it), and he said so for the third time till we thought he was looking at it. He then said,"Protect yourselves from the Fire, even if with one half of a date and he who hasn't got even this,(should do so) by (saying) a good, pleasant word.'

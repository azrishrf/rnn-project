79 | 10 | 12 | Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) `Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) "Let your wives beveiled" But he did not do so. The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to go out to answer the call of nature atnight only at Al-Manasi.' Once Sauda, the daughter of Zam`a went out and she was a tall woman.`Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her while he was in a gathering, and said, "I have recognized you, OSauda!" He (`Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veilingof women.) So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover excluding theeyes).

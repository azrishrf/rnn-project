49 | 7 | 14 | Narrated Abu Huraira: On my way to the Prophet (ﷺ) I was reciting:-- 'What a long tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it hassaved us From the land of Kufr (disbelief).' I had a slave who ran away from me on the way. When Iwent to the Prophet (ﷺ) and gave the pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam, the slave showed up whileI was still with the Prophet (ﷺ) who remarked, "O Abu Huraira! Here is your slave!" I said, "I manumithim for Allah's Sake," and so I freed him.

I then asked, "What is the best kind of manumission (of slaves)?" He replied, "Themanumission of the most expensive slave and the most beloved by his master." I said, "If I cannotafford to do that?" He said, "Help the weak or do good for a person who cannot work for himself." Isaid, "If I cannot do that?" He said, "Refrain from harming others for this will be regarded as acharitable deed for your own good."

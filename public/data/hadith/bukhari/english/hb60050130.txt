He said, "I heard him saying, "When Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water alongwith him. What the people will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn (things). So, ifanyone of you comes across this, he should fall in the thing which will appear to him as fire, for inreality, it will be fresh cold water." Hudhaifa added, "I also heard him saying, 'From among the peoplepreceding your generation, there was a man whom the angel of death visited to capture his soul. (Sohis soul was captured) and he was asked if he had done any good deed.' He replied, 'I don't rememberany good deed.' He was asked to think it over. He said, 'I do not remember, except that I used to tradewith the people in the world and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among mydebtors). So Allah made him enter Paradise." Hudhaifa further said, "I also heard him saying, 'Oncethere was a man on his death-bed, who, losing every hope of surviving said to his family: When I die,gather for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When the fire eats my meat andreaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take and crush them into powder and wait for a windyday to throw it (i.e. the powder) over the sea. They did so, but Allah collected his particles and askedhim:Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Allah forgave him." `Uqba bin `Amr said, "Iheard him saying that the Israeli used to dig the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds).

75 | 13 | 20 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud: I visited Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while he was suffering from a high fever. I touched him with my hand andsaid, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You have a high fever." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Yes, I have as much fever astwo men of you have." I said, "Is it because you will get a double reward?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Yes,no Muslim is afflicted with harm because of sickness or some other inconvenience, but that Allah willremove his sins for him as a tree sheds its leaves."

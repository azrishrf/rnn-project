77 | 19 | 35 | Narrated Aisha: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) offered prayer while he was wearing a Khamisa of his that had printed marks. Helooked at its marks and when he finished prayer, he said, "Take this Khamisa of mine to Abu Jahm,for it has just now diverted my attention from my prayer, and bring to me the Anbijania (a plain thicksheet) of Abu Jahm bin Hudhaifa bin Ghanim who belonged to Bani Adi bin Ka`b."

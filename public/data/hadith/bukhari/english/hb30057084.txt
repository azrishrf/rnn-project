30 | 57 | 84 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr: The news of my daily fasting and praying every night throughout the night reached the Prophet. So hesent for me or I met him, and he said, "I have been informed that you fast everyday and pray everynight (all the night). Fast (for some days) and give up fasting (for some days); pray and sleep, for youreyes have a right on you, and your body and your family (i.e. wife) have a right on you." I replied, "Ihave more power than that (fasting)." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Then fast like the fasts of (the Prophet)David". I said, "How?" He replied, "He used to fast on alternate days, and he used not to flee onmeeting the enemy." I said, "From where can I get that chance?" (`Ata' said, "I do not know how theexpression of fasting daily throughout the life occurred.") So, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, twice, "Whoever fastsdaily throughout his life is just as the one who does not fast at all."

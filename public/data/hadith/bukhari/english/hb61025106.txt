61 | 25 | 106 | Narrated Al-Bara: We were one-thousand-and-four-hundred persons on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (Treaty), and (at) Al-Hudaibiya (there) was a well. We drew out its water not leaving even a single drop. The Prophet (ï·º) sat atthe edge of the well and asked for some water with which he rinsed his mouth and then he threw it outinto the well. We stayed for a short while and then drew water from the well and quenched our thirst,and even our riding animals drank water to their satisfaction.

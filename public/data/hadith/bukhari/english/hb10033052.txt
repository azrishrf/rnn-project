10 | 33 | 52 | Narrated Humaid: Anas said, "The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'O Bani Salima! Don't you think that for every step of yours (that youtake towards the mosque) there is a reward (while coming for prayer)?" Mujahid said: "RegardingAllah's Statement: "We record that which they have sent before (them), and their traces" (36.12).'Their traces' means 'their steps.' " And Anas said that the people of Bani Salima wanted to shift to aplace near the Prophet (ﷺ) but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) disliked the idea of leaving their houses uninhabited andsaid, "Don't you think that you will get the reward for your footprints." Mujahid said, "Their footprints mean their foot steps and their going on foot."

And they (the people) said, "He is showing off." And another mancame and gave a Sa (a small measure of food grains); they said, "Allah is not in need of this smallamount of charity." And then the Divine Inspiration came: "Those who criticize such of the believerswho give in charity voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity except what isavailable to them." (9.79).

72 | 23 | 35 | Narrated Rafi` bin Khadij: I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We are going to face the enemy tomorrow and we do not have knives." Hesaid, "Hurry up (in killing the animal). If the killing tool causes blood to flow out, and if Allah's Nameis mentioned, eat (of the slaughtered animal). But do not slaughter with a tooth or a nail. I will tell youwhy: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians." Then we got somecamels and sheep as war booty, and one of those camels ran away, whereupon a man shot it with anarrow and stopped it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Of these camels there are some which are as wild as wildbeasts, so if one of them (runs away and) makes you tired, treat it in this manner."

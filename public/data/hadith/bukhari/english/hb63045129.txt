63 | 45 | 129 | Narrated Abu Bakr: I was with the Prophet (ﷺ) in the Cave. When I raised my head, I saw the feet of the people. I said, "OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If some of them should look down, they will see us." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Abu Bakr,be quiet! (For we are) two and Allah is the Third of us."

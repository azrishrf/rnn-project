10 | 85 | 135 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: I saw Allah's Messenger (ï·º) opening the prayer with the Takbir and raising his hands to the level of hisshoulders at the time of saying the Takbir, and on saying the Takbir for bowing he did the same; andwhen he said, "Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah ", he did the same and then said, "Rabbana wa laka lhamd."But he did not do the same on prostrating and on lifting the head from it."

34 | 29 | 44 | Narrated Khabbab: I was a blacksmith in the Pre-Islamic period, and 'Asi bin Wail owed me some money, so I went tohim to demand it. He said (to me), "I will not pay you unless you disbelieve Muhammad." I said, "Iwill not disbelieve till Allah kills you and then you get resurrected." He said, "Leave me till I die andget resurrected, then I will be given wealth and children and I will pay you your debt." On thatoccasion it was revealed to the Prophet:'Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs and says: Surely I will be given wealth andchildren? Has he known the unseen, or has he taken a covenant from the Beneficent (Allah)? (19.77-78)

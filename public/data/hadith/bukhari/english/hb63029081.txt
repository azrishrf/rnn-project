63 | 29 | 81 | Narrated Khabbaba: I came to the Prophet (ï·º) while he was leaning against his sheet cloak in the shade of the Ka`ba. We weresuffering greatly from the pagans in those days. i said (to him). "Will you invoke Allah (to help us)?"He sat down with a red face and said, "(A believer among) those who were before you used to becombed with iron combs so that nothing of his flesh or nerves would remain on his bones; yet thatwould never make him desert his religion. A saw might be put over the parting of his head whichwould be split into two parts, yet all that would never make him abandon his religion. Allah willsurely complete this religion (i.e. Islam) so that a traveler from Sana to Hadra-maut will not be afraidof anybody except Allah." (The sub-narrator, Baiyan added, "Or the wolf, lest it should harm hissheep.")

10 | 48 | 81 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went to establish peace among Bani `Amr bin `Auf. In the meantime the time ofprayer was due and the Mu'adh-dhin went to Abu Bakr and said, "Will you lead the prayer, so that Imay pronounce the Iqama?" Abu Bakr replied in the affirmative and led the prayer. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)came while the people were still praying and he entered the rows of the praying people till he stood inthe (first row). The people clapped their hands. Abu Bakr never glanced sideways in his prayer butwhen the people continued clapping, Abu Bakr looked and saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)beckoned him to stay at his place. Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Allah for that order ofAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and then he retreated till he reached the first row. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went forward andled the prayer. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) finished the prayer, he said, "O Abu Bakr! What prevented youfrom staying when I ordered you to do so?"Abu Bakr replied, "How can Ibn Abi Quhafa (Abu Bakr) dare to lead the prayer in the presence ofAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Why did you clap so much? If something happens toanyone during his prayer he should say Subhan Allah. If he says so he will be attended to, for clappingis for women."

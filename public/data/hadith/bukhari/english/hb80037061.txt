80 | 37 | 61 | Narrated `Aisha: Two old ladies from among the Jewish ladies entered upon me and said' "The dead are punished intheir graves," but I thought they were telling a lie and did not believe them in the beginning. Whenthey went away and the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon me, I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Two old ladies.." andtold him the whole story. He said, "They told the truth; the dead are really punished, to the extent thatall the animals hear (the sound resulting from) their punishment." Since then I always saw himseeking refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave in his prayers.

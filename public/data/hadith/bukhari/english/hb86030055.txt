Then the man's opponent who was wiser thanhim, got up saying (to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)) "Judge us according to Allah's Law and kindly allow me (tospeak)." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "'Speak." He said, "My son was a laborer working for this man and hecommitted an illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as aransom for my son's sin. Then I asked a learned man about this case and he informed me that my sonshould receive one hundred lashes and be exiled for one year, and the man's wife should be stoned todeath."

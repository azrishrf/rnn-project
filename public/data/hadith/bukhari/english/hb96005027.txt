96 | 5 | 27 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to his companions), "Do not fast Al-Wisal." They said, "But you fast Al-Wisail."He said, "I am not like you, for at night my Lord feeds me and makes me drink." But the people didnot give up Al-Wisal, so the Prophet (ﷺ) fasted Al-Wisal with them for two days or two nights, and thenthey saw the crescent whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "If the crescent had delayed, I would havecontinued fasting (because of you)," as if he wanted to vanquish them completely (because they hadrefused to give up Al Wisal).

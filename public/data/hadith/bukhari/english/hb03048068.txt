3 | 48 | 68 | Narrated Aswad: Ibn Az-Zubair said to me, "Aisha used to tell you secretly a number of things. What did she tell youabout the Ka`ba?" I replied, "She told me that once the Prophet (ï·º) said, 'O `Aisha! Had not your peoplebeen still close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity)! I would have dismantled the Ka`baand would have made two doors in it; one for entrance and the other for exit." Later on Ibn Az-Zubairdid the same.

59 | 11 | 98 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "When the (upper) edge of the sun appears (in the morning), don't perform aprayer till the sun appears in full, and when the lower edge of the sun sets, don't perform a prayer till itsets completely. And you should not seek to pray at sunrise or sunset for the sun rises between twosides of the head of the devil (or Satan).

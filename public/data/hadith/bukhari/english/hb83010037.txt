He replied: The people of my generation, andthen those who will follow (come after) them, and then those who will come after the later; after thatthere will come some people whose witness will precede their oaths and their oaths will go ahead oftheir witness." Ibrahim (a sub-narrator) said, "When we were young, our elder friends used to prohibitus from taking oaths by saying, 'I bear witness swearing by Allah, or by Allah's Covenant."'

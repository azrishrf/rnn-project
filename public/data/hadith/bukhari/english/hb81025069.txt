81 | 25 | 69 | Narrated Abu Sa`id: The Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned a man from the previous generation or from the people preceding your agewhom Allah had given both wealth and children. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "When the time of his deathapproached, he asked his children, 'What type of father have I been to you?' They replied: You havebeen a good father. He said, 'But he (i.e. your father) has not stored any good deeds with Allah (for theHereafter): if he should face Allah, Allah will punish him. So listen, (O my children), when I die, burnmy body till I become mere coal and then grind it into powder, and when there is a stormy wind,throw me (my ashes) in it.' So he took a firm promise from his children (to follow his instructions).And by Allah they (his sons) did accordingly(fulfilled their promise.) Then Allah said, "Be"' andbehold! That man was standing there! Allah then said. "O my slave! What made you do what youdid?" That man said, "Fear of You." So Allah forgave him.

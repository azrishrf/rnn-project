3 | 39 | 54 | Narrated Abu Huraira: In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza`a killed a man from the tribe of Bani Laith inrevenge for a killed person, belonging to them. They informed the Prophet (ﷺ) about it. So he rode hisRahila (she-camel for riding) and addressed the people saying, "Allah held back the killing fromMecca. (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether the Prophet (ﷺ) said "elephant or killing," as the Arabicwords standing for these words have great similarity in shape), but He (Allah) let His Apostle and thebelievers over power the infidels of Mecca. Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary) Verily! Fighting in Meccawas not permitted for anyone before me nor will it be permitted for anyone after me. It (war) in it wasmade legal for me for few hours or so on that day. No doubt it is at this moment a sanctuary, it is notallowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to uproot its trees or to pick up its Luqat (fallen things) exceptby a person who will look for its owner (announce it publicly). And if somebody is killed, then hisclosest relative has the right to choose one of the two-- the blood money (Diyya) or retaliation havingthe killer killed. In the meantime a man from Yemen came and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Get thatwritten for me." The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered his companions to write that for him. Then a man from Quraishsaid, "Except Al-Idhkhir (a type of grass that has good smell) O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), as we use it in ourhouses and graves." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Except Al-Idhkhir i.e. Al-Idhkhir is allowed to be plucked."

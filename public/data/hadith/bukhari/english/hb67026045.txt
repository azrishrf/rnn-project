67 | 26 | 45 | Narrated Um Habiba: I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Marry my sister, the daughter of Abu Sufyan." He said, "Do you like that?"I said, "Yes, for even now I am not your only wife; and the most beloved person to share the goodwith me is my sister." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "But that is not lawful for me (i.e., to be married to twosisters at a time.)" I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah, we have heard that you want to marry Durra,the daughter of Abu Salama." He said, "You mean the daughter of Um Salama?" I said, "Yes." Hesaid, "By Allah ! Even if she were not my stepdaughter, she would not be lawful for me to marry, forshe is my foster niece, for Thuwaiba has suckled me and Abu Salama; so you should neither presentyour daughters, nor your sisters to me."

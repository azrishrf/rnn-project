72 | 17 | 26 | Narrated Jundub bin Sufyan Al-Bajali: Once during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) we offered some animals as sacrifices. Some peopleslaughtered their sacrifices before the (Id) prayer, so when the Prophet (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he saw thatthey had slaughtered their sacrifices before the prayer. He said, "Whoever has slaughtered (hissacrifice) before the prayer, should slaughter (another sacrifice) in lieu of it; and whoever has not yetslaughtered it till we have prayed; should slaughter (it) by mentioning Allah's Name."

5 | 3 | 4 | Narrated Abu Ja`far: While I and my father were with Jabir bin `Abdullah, some people asked him about taking a bath. Hereplied, "A Sa` of water is sufficient for you." A man said, "A Sa` is not sufficient for me." Jabir said,"A Sa` was sufficient for one who had more hair than you and was better than you (meaning theProphet)." And then Jabir (put on) his garment and led the prayer.

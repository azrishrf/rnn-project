80 | 19 | 32 | Narrated Jarir: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me. "Will you relieve me from Dhi-al-Khalasa? " Dhi-al-Khalasa was an idolwhich the people used to worship and it was called Al-Ka`ba al Yamaniyya. I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)I am a man who can't sit firm on horses." So he stroked my chest (with his hand) and said, "O Allah!Make him firm and make him a guiding and well-guided man." So I went out with fifty (men) frommy tribe of Ahrnas. (The sub-narrator, Sufyan, quoting Jarir, perhaps said, "I went out with a group ofmen from my nation.") and came to Dhi-al-Khalasa and burnt it, and then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) andsaid, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have not come to you till I left it like a camel with a skin disease." TheProphet then invoked good upon Ahmas and their cavalry (fighters).

81 | 48 | 123 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Whoever has wronged his brother, should ask for his pardon (before his death),as (in the Hereafter) there will be neither a Dinar nor a Dirham. (He should secure pardon in this life)before some of his good deeds are taken and paid to his brother, or, if he has done no good deeds,some of the bad deeds of his brother are taken to be loaded on him (in the Hereafter).

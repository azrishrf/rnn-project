64 | 75 | 416 | Narrated Abu Huraira: When I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) said on my way, "O what a long tedious tiresome night; nevertheless, it has rescued me from the place of Heathenism." A slave of mine ran away on the way. When I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) I gave him the oath of allegiance (for Islam), and while I was sitting with him, suddenly the slave appeared. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me. "O Abu Huraira! Here is your slave," I said, "He (i.e. the slave) is (free) for Allah's Sake," and manumitted him.

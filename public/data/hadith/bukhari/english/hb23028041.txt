23 | 28 | 41 | Narrated Sahl: A woman brought a woven Burda (sheet) having edging (border) to the Prophet, Then Sahl askedthem whether they knew what is Burda, they said that Burda is a cloak and Sahl confirmed their reply.Then the woman said, "I have woven it with my own hands and I have brought it so that you maywear it." The Prophet (ﷺ) accepted it, and at that time he was in need of it. So he came out wearing it ashis waist-sheet. A man praised it and said, "Will you give it to me? How nice it is!" The other peoplesaid, "You have not done the right thing as the Prophet (ﷺ) is in need of it and you have asked for it whenyou know that he never turns down anybody's request." The man replied, "By Allah, I have not askedfor it to wear it but to make it my shroud." Later it was his shroud.

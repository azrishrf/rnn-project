An old man came and sat by my side. Iasked, "Who is he?" They replied, "(He is) Abu-Ad-Darda.' I said (to him), "I prayed to Allah to blessme with a pious companion and He sent you to me." He asked me, "From where are you?" I replied,"From the people of Al-Kufa." He said, "Isn't there amongst you Ibn Um `Abd, the one who used tocarry the shoes, the cushion(or pillow) and the water for ablution? Is there amongst you the onewhom Allah gave Refuge from Satan through the request of His Prophet. Is there amongst you the onewho keeps the secrets of the Prophet (ﷺ) which nobody knows except him?" Abu Darda further asked,"How does `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud) recite the Sura starting with, 'By the Night as it conceals (thelight)." (92.1) Then I recited before him:'By the Night as it envelops: And by the Day as it appears in brightness; And by male and female.'(91.1-3) On this Abu Ad-Darda' said, "By Allah, the Prophet (ﷺ) made me recite the Sura in this waywhile I was listening to him (reciting it).

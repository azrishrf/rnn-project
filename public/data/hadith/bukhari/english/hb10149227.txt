10 | 149 | 227 | Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to invoke Allah in the prayer saying "Allahumma innia`udhu bika min `adhabi l-qabr, wa a`udhu bika min fitnati l-masihi d-dajjal, wa a`udhu bika minfitnati l-mahya wa fitnati l-mamat. Allahumma inni a`udhu bika mina l-ma'thami wa l-maghram. (OAllah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of the grave, from the afflictions of the imposter-Messiah, and from the afflictions of life and death. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from sins andfrom debt)." Somebody said to him, "Why do you so frequently seek refuge with Allah from being indebt?" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "A person in debt tells lies whenever he speaks, and breaks promiseswhenever he makes (them)." `Aisha also narrated: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in his prayer seeking refugewith Allah from the afflictions of Ad-Dajjal.

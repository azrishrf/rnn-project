16 | 19 | 26 | Narrated `Aisha: The Prophet (p.b.u.h) recited (the Qur'an) aloud during the eclipse prayer and when he had finishedthe eclipse prayer he said the Takbir and bowed. When he stood straight from bowing he would say"Sami 'allahu liman hamidah Rabbana wa laka l-hamd." And he would again start reciting. In theeclipse prayer there are four bowing and four prostrations in two rak`at. Al-Auza'i and others said thatthey had heard Az-Zuhri from 'Urwa from `Aisha saying, "In the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) the suneclipsed, and he made a person to announce: 'Prayer in congregation.' He led the prayer and performedfour bowing and four prostrations in two rak`at." Narrated Al-Walid that `Abdur-Rahman bin Namirhad informed him that he had heard the same. Ibn Shihab heard the same. Az-Zuhri said, "I asked('Urwa), 'What did your brother `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair do? He prayed two rak`at (of the eclipseprayer) like the morning prayer, when he offered the (eclipse) prayer in Medina.' 'Urwa replied that hehad missed (i.e. did not pray according to) the Prophet's tradition." Sulaiman bin Kathir and Sufyanbin Husain narrated from Az-Zuhri that the prayer for the eclipse used to be offered with loudrecitation.

10 | 161 | 253 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: My grandmother Mulaika invited Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for a meal which she had prepared specially for him.He ate some of it and said, "Get up. I shall lead you in the prayer." I brought a mat that had becomeblack owing to excessive use and I sprinkled water on it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood on it and prayed tworak`at; and the orphan was with me (in the first row), and the old lady stood behind us.

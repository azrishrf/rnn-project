The slave girl said, "Once one of their girls (of that tribe) came out wearing a red leatherscarf decorated with precious stones. It fell from her or she placed it somewhere. A kite passed by thatplace, saw it Lying there and mistaking it for a piece of meat, flew away with it. Those peoplesearched for it but they did not find it. So they accused me of stealing it and started searching me andeven searched my private parts." The slave girl further said, "By Allah! while I was standing (in thatstate) with those people, the same kite passed by them and dropped the red scarf and it fell amongstthem. I told them, 'This is what you accused me of and I was innocent and now this is it.' " `Aishaadded: That slave girl came to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and embraced Islam. She had a tent or a small roomwith a low roof in the mosque. Whenever she called on me, she had a talk with me and whenever shesat with me, she would recite the following: "The day of the scarf (band) was one of the wonders ofour Lord, verily He rescued me from the disbelievers' town. `Aisha added: "Once I asked her, 'What isthe matter with you? Whenever you sit with me, you always recite these poetic verses.' On that shetold me the whole story. "

18 | 14 | 31 | Narrated Az-Zuhri: Salim told me, "`Abdullah bin `Umar said, 'I saw Allah's Messenger (ï·º) delaying the Maghrib prayer till heoffered it along with the `Isha prayer whenever he was in a hurry during the journey.' " Salim said,"Abdullah bin `Umar used to do the same whenever he was in a hurry during the journey. Aftermaking the call for Iqama, for the Maghrib prayer he used to offer three rak`at and then performTaslim. After waiting for a short while, he would pronounce the Iqama for the `Isha' prayer and offertwo rak`at and perform Taslim. He never prayed any Nawafil in between the two prayers or after the`Isha' prayers till he got up in the middle of the night (for Tahajjud prayer)."

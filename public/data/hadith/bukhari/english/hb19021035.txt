Al hamdu lil-lahi wa subhanal-lahi wa la-ilahail-lal-lah wa-l-lahu akbar wa la hawla Wala Quwata il-la-bil-lah.' (None has the right to be worshippedbut Allah. He is the Only One and has no partners . For Him is the Kingdom and all the praises aredue for Him. He is Omnipotent. All the praises are for Allah. All the glories are for Allah. And nonehas the right to be worshipped but Allah, And Allah is Great And there is neither Might nor PowerExcept with Allah). And then says: -- Allahumma, Ighfir li (O Allah! Forgive me).

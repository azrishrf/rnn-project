24 | 11 | 25 | Narrated `Aisha: Some of the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, "Who amongst us will be the first to follow you (i.e. dieafter you)?" He said, "Whoever has the longest hand." So they started measuring their hands with astick and Sauda's hand turned out to be the longest. (When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of all in thecaliphate of `Umar), we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of practicing charity, so shewas the first to follow the Prophet (ﷺ) and she used to love to practice charity. (Sauda died later in thecaliphate of Muawiya).

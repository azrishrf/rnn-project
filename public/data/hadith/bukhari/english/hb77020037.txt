77 | 20 | 37 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) forbade two ways of wearing clothes and two kinds of dealings. (A) He forbade thedealings of the Mulamasa and the Munabadha. In the Mulamasa transaction the buyer just touches thegarment he wants to buy at night or by daytime, and that touch would oblige him to buy it. In theMunabadha, one man throws his garment at another and the latter throws his at the former and thebarter is complete and valid without examining the two objects or being satisfied with them (B) Thetwo ways of wearing clothes were Ishtimal-as-Samma, i e., to cover one's shoulder with one's garmentand leave the other bare: and the other way was to wrap oneself with a garment while one was sittingin such a way that nothing of that garment would cover one's private part.

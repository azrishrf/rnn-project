88 | 7 | 16 | Narrated Abu Sa`id: While the Prophet (ﷺ) was distributing (something, `Abdullah bin Dhil Khawaisira at-Tamimi came andsaid, "Be just, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Woe to you ! Who would be just if I were not?"`Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "Allow me to cut off his neck ! " The Prophet (ﷺ) said, " Leave him, for hehas companions, and if you compare your prayers with their prayers and your fasting with theirs, youwill look down upon your prayers and fasting, in comparison to theirs. Yet they will go out of thereligion as an arrow darts through the game's body in which case, if the Qudhadh of the arrow isexamined, nothing will be found on it, and when its Nasl is examined, nothing will be found on it; andthen its Nadiyi is examined, nothing will be found on it. The arrow has been too fast to be smeared bydung and blood. The sign by which these people will be recognized will be a man whose one hand (orbreast) will be like the breast of a woman (or like a moving piece of flesh). These people will appearwhen there will be differences among the people (Muslims)." Abu Sa`id added: I testify that I heardthis from the Prophet (ﷺ) and also testify that `Ali killed those people while I was with him. The man withthe description given by the Prophet (ﷺ) was brought to `Ali. The following Verses were revealed inconnection with that very person (i.e., `Abdullah bin Dhil-Khawaisira at-Tarnimi): 'And among themare men who accuse you (O Muhammad) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms.'

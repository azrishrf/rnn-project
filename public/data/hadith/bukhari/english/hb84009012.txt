84 | 9 | 12 | Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari: I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with a group of people from (the tribe of) Al-Ash`ari, asking formounts. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "By Allah, I will not give you anything to ride, and I have nothing to mountyou on." We stayed there as long as Allah wished, and after that, some camels were brought to theProphet and he ordered that we be given three camels. When we set out, some of us said to others,"Allah will not bless us, as we all went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asking him for mounts, and although he hadsworn that he would not give us mounts, he did give us." So we returned to the Prophet; andmentioned that to him. He said, "I have not provided you with mounts, but Allah has. By Allah, Allahwilling, if I ever take an oath, and then see that another is better than the first, I make expiration formy (dissolved) oath, and do what is better and make expiration."

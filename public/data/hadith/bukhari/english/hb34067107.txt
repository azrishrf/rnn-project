34 | 67 | 107 | Narrated `Aisha: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me and I told him about the slave-girl (Buraira) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Buyand manumit her, for the Wala is for the one who manumits." In the evening the Prophet (ﷺ) got up andglorified Allah as He deserved and then said, "Why do some people impose conditions which are notpresent in Allah's Book (Laws)? Whoever imposes such a condition as is not in Allah's Laws, thenthat condition is invalid even if he imposes one hundred conditions, for Allah's conditions are morebinding and reliable."

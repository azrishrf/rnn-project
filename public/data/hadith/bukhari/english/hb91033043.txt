91 | 33 | 43 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "While I was sleeping, I saw myself performing the Tawaf of the Ka`ba. Behold,there I saw a whitish-red lank-haired man (holding himself) between two men with water droppingfrom his hair. I asked, 'Who is this?' The people replied, 'He is the son of Mary.' Then I turned my faceto see another man with red complexion, big body, curly hair, and blind in the right eye which lookedlike a protruding out grape. I asked, 'Who is he?' They replied, 'He is Ad-Dajjal.' Ibn Qatan resembleshim more than anybody else among the people and Ibn Qatan was a man from Bani Al-Mustaliq fromKhuza`a."

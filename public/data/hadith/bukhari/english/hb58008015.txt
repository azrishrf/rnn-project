58 | 8 | 15 | Narrated `Asim: I asked Anas about the Qunut (i.e. invocation in the prayer). Anas said, "It should be recited beforebowing." I said, "So-and-so claims that you say that it should be recited after bowing." He replied,"He is mistaken." Then Anas narrated to us that the Prophet (ﷺ) invoked evil on the tribe of Bani-Sulaimfor one month after bowing. ' Anas Further said, "The Prophet (ﷺ) had sent 40 or 70 Qaris (i.e. men wellversed in the knowledge of the Qur'an) to some pagans, but the latter struggled with them andmartyred them, although there was a peace pact between them and the Prophet (ﷺ) I had never seen theProphet so sorry and worried about anybody as he was about them (i.e. the Qaris).

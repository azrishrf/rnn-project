80 | 10 | 13 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: One night I slept at the house of Maimuna. The Prophet (ﷺ) woke up, answered the call of nature, washedhis face and hands, and then slept. He got up (late at night), went to a water skin, opened the mouththereof and performed ablution not using much water, yet he washed all the parts properly and thenoffered the prayer. I got up and straightened my back in order that the Prophet (ﷺ) might not feel that Iwas watching him, and then I performed the ablution, and when he got up to offer the prayer, I stood onhis left. He caught hold of my ear and brought me over to his right side. He offered thirteen rak`at inall and then lay down and slept till he started blowing out his breath as he used to do when he slept. Inthe meantime Bilal informed the Prophet (ﷺ) of the approaching time for the (Fajr) prayer, and theProphet offered the Fajr (Morning) prayer without performing new ablution. He used to say in hisinvocation, Allahumma ij`al fi qalbi nuran wa fi basari nuran, wa fi sam`i nuran, wa`an yamini nuran,wa`an yasari nuran, wa fawqi nuran, wa tahti nuran, wa amami nuran, wa khalfi nuran, waj`al linuran." Kuraib (a sub narrator) said, "I have forgotten seven other words, (which the Prophet (ﷺ)mentioned in this invocation). I met a man from the offspring of Al-`Abbas and he narrated thoseseven things to me, mentioning, '(Let there be light in) my nerves, my flesh, my blood, my hair andmy body,' and he also mentioned two other things."

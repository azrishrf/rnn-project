16 | 9 | 13 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas: The sun eclipsed in the lifetime of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) . Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered the eclipse prayerand stood for a long period equal to the period in which one could recite Surat-al-Baqara. Then hebowed for a long time and then stood up for a long period which was shorter than that of the firststanding, then bowed again for a long time but for a shorter period than the first; then he prostratedtwice and then stood up for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing; then hebowed for a long time which was shorter than the previous one, and then he raised his head and stoodup for a long period which was shorter than the first standing, then he bowed for a long time whichwas shorter than the first bowing, and then prostrated (twice) and finished the prayer. By then, the sun(eclipse) had cleared. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, "The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah.They eclipse neither because of the death of somebody nor because of his life (i.e. birth). So when yousee them, remember Allah." The people say, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We saw you taking something fromyour place and then we saw you retreating." The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "I saw Paradise and stretched myhands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as theworld remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most ofthe inhabitants were women." The people asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why is it so?" The Prophet (ﷺ)replied, "Because of their ungratefulness." It was asked whether they are ungrateful to Allah. TheProphet said, "They are ungrateful to their companions of life (husbands) and ungrateful to gooddeeds. If you are benevolent to one of them throughout the life and if she sees anything (undesirable)in you, she will say, 'I have never had any good from you.' "

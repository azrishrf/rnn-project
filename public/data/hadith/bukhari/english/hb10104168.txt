10 | 104 | 168 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Qur'an is recited in every prayer and in those prayers in which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited aloud forus, we recite aloud in the same prayers for you; and the prayers in which the Prophet (ﷺ) recited quietly,we recite quietly. If you recite "Al-Fatiha" only it is sufficient but if you recite something else inaddition, it is better.

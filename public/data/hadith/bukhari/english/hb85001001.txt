Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) performed ablution and he poured over me the water (of his ablution)and I came to my senses and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What shall I do regarding my property? Howshall I distribute it?" The Prophet (ﷺ) did not reply till the Divine Verses of inheritance were revealed .

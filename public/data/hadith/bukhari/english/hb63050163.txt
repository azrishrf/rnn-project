63 | 50 | 163 | Narrated Anas: When `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf came to Medina and the Prophet (ﷺ) established the bond of brotherhoodbetween him and Sa`d bin Ar-Rabi-al-Ansari, Saud suggested that `Abdur-Rahman should accept halfof his property and family. `Abdur Rahman said, "May Allah bless you in your family and property;guide me to the market." So `Abdur-Rahman (while doing business in the market) made some profitof some condensed dry yoghurt and butter. After a few days the Prophet (ﷺ) saw him wearing clothesstained with yellow perfume. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, "What is this, O `Abdur-Rahman?" He said, "OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have married an Ansar' woman." The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, "What have you given her asMahr?" He (i.e. `Abdur-Rahman) said, "A piece of gold, about the weight of a date stone." Then theProphet said, Give a banquet, even though of a sheep."

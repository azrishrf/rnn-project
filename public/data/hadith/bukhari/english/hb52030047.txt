52 | 30 | 47 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "If the people knew what is the reward of making the call (for the prayer) and (ofbeing in) the first row (in the prayer), and if they found no other way to get this privilege except bycasting lots, they would certainly cast lots for it. If they knew the reward of the noon prayer, theywould race for it, and if they knew the reward of the morning (i.e. Fajr) and `Isha prayers, they wouldpresent themselves for the prayer even if they had to crawl to reach there.

76 | 39 | 63 | Narrated Abu Qatada: I heard the Prophet (ï·º) saying, "A good dream is from Allah, and a bad dream is from Satan. So if anyoneof you sees (in a dream) something he dislikes, when he gets up he should blow thrice (on his leftside) and seek refuge with Allah from its evil for then it will not harm him."

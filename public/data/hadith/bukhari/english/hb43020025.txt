43 | 20 | 25 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian, and responsible for what is in hiscustody. The ruler is a guardian of his subjects and responsible for them; a husband is a guardian ofhis family and is responsible for it; a lady is a guardian of her husband's house and is responsible forit, and a servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for it." I heard that fromAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I think that the Prophet (ﷺ) also said, "A man is a guardian of is father's property andis responsible for it, so all of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and things under yourcare."

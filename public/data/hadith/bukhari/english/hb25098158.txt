25 | 98 | 158 | Narrated `Aisha: We got down at Al-Muzdalifa and Sauda asked the permission of the Prophet (ﷺ) to leave (early) before the rush of the people. She was a slow woman and he gave her permission, so she departed (from Al- Muzdalifa) before the rush of the people. We kept on staying at Al-Muzdalifa till dawn, and set out with the Prophet (ﷺ) but (I suffered so much that) I wished I had taken the permission of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as Sauda had done, and that would have been dearer to me than any other happiness.

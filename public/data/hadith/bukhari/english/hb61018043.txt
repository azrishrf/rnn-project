61 | 18 | 43 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "My similitude in comparison with the other prophets before me, is that of a manwho has built a house nicely and beautifully, except for a place of one brick in a corner. The people goabout it and wonder at its beauty, but say: 'Would that this brick be put in its place!' So I am that brick,and I am the last of the Prophets."

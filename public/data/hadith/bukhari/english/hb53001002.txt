53 | 1 | 2 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: There was a dispute amongst the people of the tribe of Bani `Amr bin `Auf. The Prophet (ﷺ) went to themalong with some of his companions in order to make peace between them. The time for the prayerbecame due but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not turn up; Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer butthe Prophet (ﷺ) did not turn up, so Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, "The time for the prayer is due andthe Prophet (ﷺ) i detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?" Abu Bakr replied, "Yes, you wish."So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead the prayer), but theProphet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The people started clapping andthey clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither and thither in the prayer, but he turnedround and saw the Prophet (ﷺ) standing behind him. The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned him with his hand to keep onpraying where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came inthe (first) row, and the Prophet (ﷺ) went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet (ﷺ)finished the prayer, he turned towards the people and said, "O people! When something happens toyou during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women only. Ifsomething happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: 'Subhan Allah', (Glorified be Allah), forwhoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented youfrom leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned to you (to continue)?" Abu Bakr replied, "Itdid not befit the son of Abu Quhafa to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet.

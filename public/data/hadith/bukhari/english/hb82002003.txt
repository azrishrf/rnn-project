The man said, "Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?" TheProphet said, "Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been created to do or he will do thosedeeds which will be made easy for him to do." (i.e. everybody will find easy to do such deeds as willlead him to his destined place for which he has been created).

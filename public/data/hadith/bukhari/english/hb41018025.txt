41 | 18 | 25 | Narrated Rafi` bin Khadij: My uncle Zuhair said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade us to do a thing which was a source of help to us." Isaid, "Whatever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said was right." He said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for me and asked,'What are you doing with your farms?' I replied, 'We give our farms on rent on the basis that we getthe yield produced at the banks of the water streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for some Wasqs ofbarley and dates.' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Do not do so, but cultivate (the land) yourselves or let it becultivated by others gratis, or keep it uncultivated.' I said, 'We hear and obey.'

Allah'sf Apostleallowed him to enter and `Umar came in while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was smiling, `Umar said "O Allah'sApostle! May Allah always keep you smiling." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "These women who have been here,roused my wonder, for as soon as they heard your voice, they quickly put on their veils. "`Umar said,"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You have more right to be feared by them than I." Then `Umar addressed thewomen saying, "O enemies of yourselves! You fear me more than you do Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?" Theysaid, "Yes, for you are harsher and sterner than Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)." Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "O IbnAl-Khattab! By Him in Whose Hands my life is! Never does Satan find you going on a way, but hetakes another way other than yours."

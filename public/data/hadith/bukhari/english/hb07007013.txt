7 | 7 | 13 | Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama: I was with `Abdullah and Abu Musa; the latter asked the former, "O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! What isyour opinion if somebody becomes Junub and no water is available?" `Abdullah replied, "Do not praytill water is found." Abu Musa said, "What do you say about the statement of `Ammar (who wasordered by the Prophet (ﷺ) to perform Tayammum). The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him: "Perform Tayammum andthat would be sufficient." `Abdullah replied, "Don't you see that `Umar was not satisfied by `Ammar'sstatement?" Abu- Musa said, "All right, leave `Ammar's statement, but what will you say about thisverse (of Tayammum)?" `Abdullah kept quiet and then said, "If we allowed it, then they wouldprobably perform Tayammum even if water was available, if one of them found it (water) cold." Thenarrator added, "I said to Shaqiq, "Then did `Abdullah dislike to perform Tayammum because ofthis?" He replied, "Yes."

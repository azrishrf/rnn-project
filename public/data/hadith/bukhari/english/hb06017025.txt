6 | 17 | 25 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "At every womb Allah appoints an angel who says, 'O Lord! A drop of semen, OLord! A clot. O Lord! A little lump of flesh." Then if Allah wishes (to complete) its creation, the angelasks, (O Lord!) Will it be a male or female, a wretched or a blessed, and how much will his provisionbe? And what will his age be?' So all that is written while the child is still in the mother's womb."

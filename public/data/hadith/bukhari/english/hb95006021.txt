95 | 6 | 21 | Narrated Tauba Al-`Anbari: Ash-'Shu`bi asked me, "Did you notice how Al-Hasan used to narrate Hadiths from the Prophets? Istayed with Ibn `Umar for about two or one-and-half years and I did not hear him narrating any thingfrom the Prophet (ﷺ) except his (Hadith): He (Ibn `Umar) said, "Some of the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ)including Sa`d, were going to eat meat, but one of the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) called them, saying, 'It isthe meat of a Mastigure.' The people then stopped eating it. On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Carry oneating, for it is lawful.' Or said, 'There is no harm in eating it, but it is not from my meals."

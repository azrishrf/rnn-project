62 | 7 | 48 | Narrated Abu Musa: The Prophet (ﷺ) entered a garden and ordered me to guard its gate. A man came and asked permission toenter. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise." Behold! Itwas Abu Bakr. Another man came and asked the permission to enter. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Admit himand give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise." Behold! It was `Umar. Then another man came,asking the permission to enter. The Prophet (ﷺ) kept silent for a short while and then said, "Admit himand give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him." Behold! Itwas `Uthman bin `Affan. `Asim, in another narration, said that the Prophet (ﷺ) was sitting in a placewhere there was water, and he was uncovering both his knees or his knee, and when `Uthman entered,he covered them (or it).

(18.72). Mosesthen violated the agreement for the first time because of forgetfulness, then Moses promised that if heasked Al-Khadir about anything, the latter would have the right to desert him. Moses abided by thatcondition and on the third occasion he intentionally asked Al-Khadir and caused that condition to beapplied. The three occasions referred to above are referred to by the following Verses:"Call me not to account for forgetting And be not hard upon me." (18.73)"Then they met a boy and Khadir killed him."

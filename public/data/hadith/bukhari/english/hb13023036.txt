13 | 23 | 36 | Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib: On the day of Nahr Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) delivered the Khutba after the `Id prayer and said, "Anyone whoprayed like us and slaughtered the sacrifice like we did then he acted according to our (Nusuk)tradition of sacrificing, and whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, then that was justmutton (i.e. not sacrifice)." Abu Burda bin Naiyar stood up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah, Islaughtered my sacrifice before I offered the (Id) prayer and thought that today was the day of eatingand drinking (nonalcoholic drinks) and so I made haste (in slaughtering) and ate and also fed myfamily and neighbors." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "That was just mutton (not a sacrifice)." Then Abu Burdasaid, "I have a young she-goat and no doubt, it is better than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as asacrifice for me?" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "Yes. But it will not be sufficient for anyone else (as asacrifice), after you."

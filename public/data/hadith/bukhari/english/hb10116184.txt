10 | 116 | 184 | Narrated Mutarrif bin `Abdullah: `Imran bin Husain and I offered the prayer behind `Ali bin Abi Talib. When `Ali prostrated, he saidthe Takbir, when he raised his head, he said the Takbir and when he got up for the third rak`a he saidthe Takbir. On completion of the prayer `Imran took my hand and said, "This (i.e. `Ali) made meremember the prayer of Muhammad" Or he said, "He led us in a prayer like that of Muhammad."

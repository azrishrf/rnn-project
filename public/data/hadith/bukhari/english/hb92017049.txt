92 | 17 | 49 | Narrated Shaqiq: I heard Hudhaifa saying, "While we were sitting with `Umar, he said, 'Who among you remembers thestatement of the Prophet (ï·º) about the afflictions?' Hudhaifa said, "The affliction of a man in his family,his property, his children and his neighbors are expiated by his prayers, Zakat (and alms) andenjoining good and forbidding evil." `Umar said, "I do not ask you about these afflictions, but aboutthose afflictions which will move like the waves of the sea." Hudhaifa said, "Don't worry about it, Ochief of the believers, for there is a closed door between you and them." `Umar said, "Will that doorbe broken or opened?" I said, "No. it will be broken." `Umar said, "Then it will never be closed," Isaid, "Yes." We asked Hudhaifa, "Did `Umar know what that door meant?" He replied, "Yes, as Iknow that there will be night before tomorrow morning, that is because I narrated to him a truenarration free from errors." We dared not ask Hudhaifa as to whom the door represented so weordered Masruq to ask him what does the door stand for? He replied, "`Umar."

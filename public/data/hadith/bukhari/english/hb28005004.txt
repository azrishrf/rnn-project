He sent abatch of his companions by another route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to them,"Proceed along the seashore till we meet all together." So, they took the route of the seashore, andwhen they started all of them assumed Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, hiscompanions saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a sheonager.They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each other: "How do we eat the meat ofthe game while we are in a state of Ihram?" So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager's meat, andwhen they met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) they asked, saying, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We assumed Ihram with theexception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded ashe-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other), 'Howdo we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?' So, we carried the rest of its meat. TheProphet asked, "Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?" They replied in thenegative. He said, "Then eat what is left of its meat."

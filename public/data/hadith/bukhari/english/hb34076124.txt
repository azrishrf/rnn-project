34 | 76 | 124 | Narrated Ibn Shihab: that Malik bin Aus said, "I was in need of change for one-hundred Dinars. Talha bin 'Ubaidullahcalled me and we discussed the matter, and he agreed to change (my Dinars). He took the gold piecesin his hands and fidgeted with them, and then said, "Wait till my storekeeper comes from the forest."`Umar was listening to that and said, "By Allah! You should not separate from Talha till you get themoney from him, for Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, 'The selling of gold for gold is Riba (usury) except if theexchange is from hand to hand and equal in amount, and similarly, the selling of wheat for wheat isRiba (usury) unless it is from hand to hand and equal in amount, and the selling of barley for barley isusury unless it is from hand to hand and equal in amount, and dates for dates, is usury unless it is fromhand to hand and equal in amount"

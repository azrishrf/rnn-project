83 | 31 | 81 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: While the Prophet (ﷺ) was delivering a sermon, he saw a man standing, so he asked about that man. They(the people) said, "It is Abu Israil who has vowed that he will stand and never sit down, and he willnever come in the shade, nor speak to anybody, and will fast.'' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Order him to speakand let him come in the shade, and make him sit down, but let him complete his fast."

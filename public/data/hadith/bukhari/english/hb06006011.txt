Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of thedwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?" He replied,"You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient inintelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you." Thewomen asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is notthe evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. Hesaid, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fastduring her menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in herreligion."

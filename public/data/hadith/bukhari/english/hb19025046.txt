19 | 25 | 46 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to teach us the way of doing Istikhara (Istikhara means to ask Allah toguide one to the right sort of action concerning any job or a deed), in all matters as he taught us theSuras of the Qur'an. He said, "If anyone of you thinks of doing any job he should offer a two rak`atprayer other than the compulsory ones and say (after the prayer): -- 'Allahumma inni astakhirukabi'ilmika, Wa astaqdiruka bi-qudratika, Wa as'alaka min fadlika Al-`azlm Fa-innaka taqdiru Walaaqdiru, Wa ta'lamu Wala a'lamu, Wa anta 'allamu l-ghuyub. Allahumma, in kunta ta'lam anna hadha-lamraKhairun li fi dini wa ma'ashi wa'aqibati `Amri (or 'ajili `Amri wa'ajilihi) Faqdirhu wa yas-sirhu lithumma barik li Fihi, Wa in kunta ta'lamu anna hadha-lamra shar-run li fi dini wa ma'ashi wa'aqibati`Amri (or fi'ajili `Amri wa ajilihi) Fasrifhu anni was-rifni anhu. Waqdir li al-khaira haithu kanaThumma ardini bihi.' (O Allah! I ask guidance from Your knowledge, And Power from Your Mightand I ask for Your great blessings. You are capable and I am not. You know and I do not and Youknow the unseen. O Allah! If You know that this job is good for my religion and my subsistence andin my Hereafter--(or said: If it is better for my present and later needs)--Then You ordain it for me andmake it easy for me to get, And then bless me in it, and if You know that this job is harmful to me Inmy religion and subsistence and in the Hereafter--(or said: If it is worse for my present and laterneeds)--Then keep it away from me and let me be away from it. And ordain for me whatever is goodfor me, And make me satisfied with it). The Prophet (ï·º) added that then the person should name(mention) his need.

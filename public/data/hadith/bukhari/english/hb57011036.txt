57 | 11 | 36 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika: Some silken cloaks with golden buttons were presented to the Prophet. He distributed them amongsthis companions and kept one for Makhrama, bin Naufal. Later on Makhrama came along with his sonAl-Miswar bin Makhrama, and stood up at the gate and said (to his son). "Call him (i.e. the Prophet)to me." The Prophet (ï·º) heard his voice, took a silken cloak and brought it to him, placing those goldenbuttons in front of him saying, "O Abu-al-Miswar! I have kept this aside for you! O Abu-al Miswar! Ihave kept this aside for you!" Makhrama was a bad-tempered man.

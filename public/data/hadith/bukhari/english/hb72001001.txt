72 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Adi bin Hatim: I asked the Prophet (ï·º) about the game killed by a Mi'rad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece ofwood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, "If the game is killed with itssharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a hit by its broad side then the game is(unlawful to eat) for it has been beaten to death." I asked him about the game killed by a trainedhound. He said, "If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for killing the game by the hound, islike its slaughtering. But if you see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that itmight have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, then you should not eat of it,because you have mentioned Allah's name on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentionedit on some other hound.

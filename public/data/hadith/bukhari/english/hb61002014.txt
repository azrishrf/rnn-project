61 | 2 | 14 | Narrated Muhammad bin Jubair bin Mut`im: That while he was with a delegation from Quraish to Muawiya, the latter heard the news that`Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said that there would be a king from the tribe of Qahtan. On thatMuawiya became angry, got up and then praised Allah as He deserved, and said, "Now then, I haveheard that some men amongst you narrate things which are neither in the Holy Book, nor have beentold by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Those men are the ignorant amongst you. Beware of such hopes as make thepeople go astray, for I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'Authority of ruling will remain with Quraish, andwhoever bears hostility to them, Allah will destroy him as long as they abide by the laws of thereligion.'

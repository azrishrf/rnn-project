25 | 48 | 80 | Narrated Abu Wail: (One day) I sat along with Shaiba on the chair inside the Ka`ba. He (Shaiba) said, "No doubt, `Umar sat at this place and said, 'I intended not to leave any yellow (i.e. gold) or white (i.e. silver) (inside the Ka`ba) undistributed.' I said (to `Umar), 'But your two companions (i.e. The Prophet (ï·º) and Abu Bakr) did not do so.' `Umar said, They are the two persons whom I always follow.' "

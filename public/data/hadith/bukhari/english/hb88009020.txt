88 | 9 | 20 | Narrated `Itban bin Malik: Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me in the morning, and a man among us said, "Where is Malik bin Ad-Dukhshun?" Another man from us replied, "He is a hypocrite who does not love Allah and HisApostle." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Don't you think that he says: None has the right to be worshipped butAllah, only for Allah's sake?" They replied, "Yes" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Nobody will meet Allah withthat saying on the Day of Resurrection, but Allah will save him from the Fire."

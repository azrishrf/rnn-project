30 | 49 | 72 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade Al-Wisal in fasting. So, one of the Muslims said to him, "But you practice Al-Wisal. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "Who amongst you is similar to me? I am given foodand drink during my sleep by my Lord." So, when the people refused to stop Al-Wisal (fastingcontinuously), the Prophet (ﷺ) fasted day and night continuously along with them for a day and thenanother day and then they saw the crescent moon (of the month of Shawwal). The Prophet (ﷺ) said tothem (angrily), "If It (the crescent) had not appeared, I would have made you fast for a longer period."That was as a punishment for them when they refused to stop (practicing Al-Wisal).

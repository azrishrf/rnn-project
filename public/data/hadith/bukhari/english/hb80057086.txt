80 | 57 | 86 | Narrated `Aisha: that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was affected by magic, so much that he used to think that he had done somethingwhich in fact, he did not do, and he invoked his Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, "O`Aisha!) Do you know that Allah has advised me as to the problem I consulted Him about?" `Aishasaid, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What's that?" He said, "Two men came to me and one of them sat at myhead and the other at my feet, and one of them asked his companion, 'What is wrong with this man?'The latter replied, 'He is under the effect of magic.' The former asked, 'Who has worked magic onhim?' The latter replied, 'Labid bin Al-A'sam.' The former asked, 'With what did he work the magic?'The latter replied, 'With a comb and the hair, which are stuck to the comb, and the skin of pollen of adate-palm tree.' The former asked, 'Where is that?' The latter replied, 'It is in Dharwan.' Dharwan wasa well in the dwelling place of the (tribe of) Bani Zuraiq. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went to that well andreturned to `Aisha, saying, 'By Allah, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion of Hinna, (1)and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.' `Aisha added, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me andinformed me about the well. I asked the Prophet, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), why didn't you take out the skinof pollen?' He said, 'As for me, Allah has cured me and I hated to draw the attention of the people tosuch evil (which they might learn and harm others with).' "Narrated Hisham's father: `Aisha said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was bewitched, so he invoked Allahrepeatedly requesting Him to cure him from that magic)." Hisham then narrated the above narration.

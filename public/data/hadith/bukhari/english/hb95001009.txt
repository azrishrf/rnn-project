So Allah revealed: --'Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven; surely we shall turn you to aprayer direction (Qibla) that shall please you.' (2.144) Thus he was directed towards the Ka`ba. A manprayed the `Asr prayer with the Prophet (ﷺ) and then went out, and passing by some people from theAnsar, he said, "I testify. that I have prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ) and he (the Prophet) has prayed facingthe Ka`ba." Thereupon they, who were bowing in the `Asr prayer, turned towards the Ka`ba.

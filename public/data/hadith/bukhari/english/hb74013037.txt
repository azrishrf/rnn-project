74 | 13 | 37 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Abu Talha had the largest number of datepalms from amongst the Ansars of Medina. The dearest ofhis property to him was Bairuha garden which was facing the (Prophet's) Mosque. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)used to enter it and drink of its good fresh water. When the Holy Verse:-- 'By no means shall youattain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.' (3.92) was revealed, AbuTalha got up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah says: By no means shall you attain righteousnessunless you spend of that which you love,' and the dearest of my property to me is the Bairuha gardenand I want to give it in charity in Allah's Cause, seeking to be rewarded by Allah for that. So you canspend it, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), where-ever Allah instructs you. ' Allah s Apostle said, "Good! That is aperishable (or profitable) wealth" (`Abdullah is in doubt as to which word was used.) He said, "I haveheard what you have said but in my opinion you'd better give it to your kith and kin." On that AbuTalha said, "I will do so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" Abu Talha distributed that garden among his kith and kinand cousins.

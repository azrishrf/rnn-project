I said, "Yes, for I am not your only wife, and theperson I like most to share the good with me, is my sister." He said, "That is not lawful for me." I said,"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We have heard that you want to marry Durra, the daughter of Abu Salama." Hesaid, "You mean the daughter of Um Salama?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Even if she were not my stepdaughter,she is unlawful for me, for she is my foster niece. Thuwaiba suckled me and Abu Salama.So you should not present to me your daughters and sisters."Narrated 'Urwa: Thuwaiba had been a slave girl whom Abu Lahab had emancipated.

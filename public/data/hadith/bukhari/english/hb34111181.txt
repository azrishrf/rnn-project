Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) selected her for himself and he setout in her company till he reached Sadd-ar-Rawha' where her menses were over and he married her.Then Hais (a kind of meal) was prepared and served on a small leather sheet (used for serving meals).Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said to me, "Inform those who are around you (about the wedding banquet)." Sothat was the marriage banquet given by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for (his marriage with) Safiya. After that weproceeded to Medina and I saw that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was covering her with a cloak while she wasbehind him. Then he would sit beside his camel and let Safiya put her feet on his knees to ride (thecamel).

93 | 5 | 10 | Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Samura: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "O `Abdur-Rahman! Do not seek to be a ruler, for if you are given authority on yourdemand then you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking (for it), then youwill be helped (by Allah) in it. If you ever take an oath to do something and later on you find thatsomething else is better, then you should expiate your oath and do what is better."

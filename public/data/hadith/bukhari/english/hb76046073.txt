76 | 46 | 73 | Narrated `Aisha: Some people asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about the fore-tellers He said. ' They are nothing" They said, 'OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Sometimes they tell us of a thing which turns out to be true." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "AJinn snatches that true word and pours it Into the ear of his friend (the fore-teller) (as one putssomething into a bottle) The foreteller then mixes with that word one hundred lies."

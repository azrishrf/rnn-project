59 | 7 | 36 | Narrated `Aisha: I stuffed for the Prophet (ﷺ) a pillow decorated with pictures (of animals) which looked like a Namruqa(i.e. a small cushion). He came and stood among the people with excitement apparent on his face. Isaid, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is wrong?" He said, "What is this pillow?" I said, "I have prepared thispillow for you, so that you may recline on it." He said, "Don't you know that angels do not enter ahouse wherein there are pictures; and whoever makes a picture will be punished on the Day ofResurrection and will be asked to give life to (what he has created)?"

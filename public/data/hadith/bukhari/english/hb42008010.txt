42 | 8 | 10 | Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair: An Ansari man quarreled with Az-Zubair about a canal in the Harra which was used for irrigatingdate-palms. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), ordering Zubair to be moderate, said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) firstand then leave the water for your neighbor." The Ansari said, "Is it because he is your aunt's son?" Onthat the color of the face of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) changed and he said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) andwithhold the water till it reaches the walls that are between the pits around the trees." So, Allah'sApostle gave Zubair his full right. Zubair said, "By Allah, the following verse was revealed in thatconnection": "But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputesbetween them." (4.65)(The sub-narrator,) Ibn Shihab said to Juraij (another sub-narrator), "The Ansar and the other peopleinterpreted the saying of the Prophet, 'Irrigate (your land) and withhold the water till it reaches thewalls between the pits around the trees,' as meaning up to the ankles."

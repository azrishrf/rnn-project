70 | 2 | 4 | Narrated `Umar bin Abi Salama: I was a boy under the care of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and my hand used to go around the dish while I waseating. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, 'O boy! Mention the Name of Allah and eat with your righthand, and eat of the dish what is nearer to you." Since then I have applied those instructions wheneating.

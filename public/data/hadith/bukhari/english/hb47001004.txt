They went to the Prophet (ﷺ)and asked his permission to slaughter their camels, and he agreed. `Umar met them and they told himabout it, and he said, "How would you survive after slaughtering your camels?" Then he went to theProphet and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! How would they survive after slaughtering their camels?"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered `Umar, "Call upon the people to bring what has remained of their food." Aleather sheet was spread and all the food was collected and heaped over it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)stood up and invoked Allah to bless it, and then directed all the people to come with their utensils, andthey started taking from it till all of them got what was sufficient for them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said,"I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am His Messenger."

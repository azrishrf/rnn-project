49 | 13 | 25 | Narrated Ibn Muhairiz: I saw Abu Sa`id and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu Sa`id said, "We went with Allah'sApostle, in the Ghazwa of Bani Al-Mustaliq and we captured some of the 'Arabs as captives, and thelong separation from our wives was pressing us hard and we wanted to practice coitus interruptus. Weasked Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (whether it was permissible). He said, "It is better for you not to do so. No soul,(that which Allah has) destined to exist, up to the Day of Resurrection, but will definitely come, intoexistence."

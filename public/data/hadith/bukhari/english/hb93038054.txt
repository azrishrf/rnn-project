93 | 38 | 54 | Narrated Abu Laila bin `Abdullah bin `Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl: Sahl bin Abi Hathma and some great men of his tribe said, `Abdullah bin 'Sahl and Muhaiyisa wentout to Khaibar as they were struck with poverty and difficult living conditions. Then Muhaiyisa wasinformed that `Abdullah had been killed and thrown in a pit or a spring. Muhaiyisa went to the Jewsand said, "By Allah, you have killed my companion." The Jews said, "By Allah, we have not killedhim." Muhaiyisa then came back to his people and told them the story. He, his elder brotherHuwaiyisa and `Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl came (to the Prophet) and he who had been at Khaibar,proceeded to speak, but the Prophet (ﷺ) said to Muhaiyisa, "The eldest! The eldest!" meaning, "Let theeldest of you speak." So Huwaiyisa spoke first and then Muhaiyisa. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The Jewsshould either pay the blood money of your (deceased) companion or be ready for war." After thatAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) wrote a letter to the Jews in that respect, and they wrote that they had not killed him.Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Huwaiyisa, Muhaiyisa and `Abdur-Rahman, "Can you take an oath bywhich you will be entitled to take the blood money?" They said, "No." He said (to them), "Shall weask the Jews to take an oath before you?" They replied, "But the Jews are not Muslims." So Allah'sApostle gave them one-hundred she-camels as blood money from himself. Sahl added: When thoseshe-camels were made to enter the house, one of them kicked me with its leg.

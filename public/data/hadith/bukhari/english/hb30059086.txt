30 | 59 | 86 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As: The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, "You fast daily all the year and pray every night all the night?" I replied in theaffirmative. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "If you keep on doing this, your eyes will become weak and your bodywill get tired. He who fasts all the year is as he who did not fast at all. The fasting of three days (amonth) will be equal to the fasting of the whole year." I replied, "I have the power for more than this."The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Then fast like the fasting of David who used to fast on alternate days and wouldnever flee from the battle field, on meeting the enemy."

46 | 18 | 21 | Narrated `Uqba bin 'Amir: We said to the Prophet, "You send us out and it happens that we have to stay with people who do not entertain us. What do you think about it? He said to us, "If you stay with some people and they entertain you as they should for a guest, accept their hospitality, but if they don't, take the right ofthe guest from them."

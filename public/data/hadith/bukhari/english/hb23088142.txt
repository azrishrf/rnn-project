And then added, "Yes, (they are being punished for a bigsin), for one of them used to go about with calumnies while the other never saved himself from beingsoiled with his urine." (Ibn `Abbas added): Then he took a green leaf of a date-palm) and split it intotwo pieces and fixed one piece on each grave and said, "May their punishment be abated till these(two pieces) get dry."

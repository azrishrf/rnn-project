52 | 27 | 41 | Narrated Um Salama: Once Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "You people present your cases to me and some of you may be moreeloquent and persuasive in presenting their argument. So, if I give some one's right to another(wrongly) because of the latter's (tricky) presentation of the case, I am really giving him a piece offire; so he should not take it."

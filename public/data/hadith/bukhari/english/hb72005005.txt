72 | 5 | 5 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Maghaffal: that he saw a man throwing stones with two fingers (at something) and said to him, "Do not throwstones, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has forbidden throwing stones, or he used to dislike it." `Abdullah added:Throwing stones will neither hunt the game, nor kill (or hurt) an enemy, but it may break a tooth orgouge out an eye." Afterwards `Abdullah once again saw the man throwing stones. He said to him, "Itell you that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has forbidden or disliked the throwing the stones (in such a way), yet youare throwing stones! I shall not talk to you for such-and-such a period."

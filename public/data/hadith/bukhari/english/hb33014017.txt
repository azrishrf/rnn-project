33 | 14 | 17 | Narrated `Amra bint `Abdur-Rahman from `Aisha: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to practice I`tikaf every year in the month of Ramadan. And after offering themorning prayer, he used to enter the place of his I`tikaf. `Aisha asked his permission to let her practiceI`tikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When Hafsa heard of that, she alsopitched a tent (for herself), and when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in themorning, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished the morning prayer, he saw four tents and asked, "What isthis?" He was informed about it. He then said, "What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Removethe tents, for I do not want to see them." So, the tents were removed. The Prophet (ﷺ) did not performI`tikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.

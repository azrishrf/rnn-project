63 | 18 | 37 | Narrated Anas: On the day of the battle of Uhud, the people ran away, leaving the Prophet (ﷺ) , but Abu- Talha wasshielding the Prophet (ﷺ) with his shield in front of him. Abu Talha was a strong, experienced archer whoused to keep his arrow bow strong and well stretched. On that day he broke two or three arrow bows.If any man passed by carrying a quiver full of arrows, the Prophet (ﷺ) would say to him, "Empty it infront of Abu Talha." When the Prophet (ﷺ) stated looking at the enemy by raising his head, Abu Talhasaid, "O Allah's Prophet! Let my parents be sacrificed for your sake! Please don't raise your head andmake it visible, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you. Let my neck and chest be wounded insteadof yours." (On that day) I saw `Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr and Um Sulaim both lifting theirdresses up so that I was able to see the ornaments of their legs, and they were carrying the water skinsof their arms to pour the water into the mouths of the thirsty people and then go back and fill them andcome to pour the water into the mouths of the people again. (On that day) Abu Talha's sword fell fromhis hand twice or thrice.

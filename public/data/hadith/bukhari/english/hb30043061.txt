He replied, "O Allah'sApostle! (Will you wait) till it is evening?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Get down and mix Sawiq with waterfor us." He replied, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (If you wait) till it is evening." The Prophet (ﷺ) said again, "Getdown and mix Sawiq with water for us." He replied, "It is still daytime."(1) The Prophet (ﷺ) said again,"Get down and mix Sawiq with water for us." He got down and mixed Sawiq for them. The Prophet (ﷺ)drank it and then said, "When you see night falling from this side, the fasting person should break hisfast."

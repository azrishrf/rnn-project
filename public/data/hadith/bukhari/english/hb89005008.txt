(4.19) The custom (in the Pre-lslamic Period) was that if a man died, his relatives used to havethe right to inherit his wife, and if one of them wished, he could marry her, or they could marry her tosomebody else, or prevent her from marrying if they wished, for they had more right to dispose of herthan her own relatives. Therefore this Verse was revealed concerning this matter.

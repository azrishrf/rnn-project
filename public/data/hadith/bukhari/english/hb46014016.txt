Abu Shu'aib said to him,"Prepare a meal sufficient for five persons so that I might invite the Prophet (ﷺ) besides other fourpersons." Abu Shu'aib had seen the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet (ﷺ) and so he invited him.Another man who was not invited, followed the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Abu Shu'aib, "This manhas followed us. Do you allow him to share the meal?" Abu Shu'aib said, "Yes."

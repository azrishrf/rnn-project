He said to him thrice, "Go back andpray again for you have not prayed." The man said, "By Him Who has sent you with the truth! I donot know a better way of praying. Kindly teach Me how to pray." He said, "When you stand for theprayer, say Takbir and then recite from the Qur'an what you know and then bow with calmness tillyou feel at ease, then rise from bowing till you stand straight.

Abu Bakr did not alter it. `Umar expanded it on the samepattern as it was in the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) by using adobes, leaves of date-palms and changingthe pillars into wooden ones. `Uthman changed it by expanding it to a great extent and built its wallswith engraved stones and lime and made its pillars of engraved stones and its roof of teak wood.

24 | 51 | 80 | Narrated `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) used to give me something but I would say to him, "would you give it to a poorer andmore needy one than l?" The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said to me, "Take it. If you are given something fromthis property, without asking for it or having greed for it take it; and if not given, do not run for it."

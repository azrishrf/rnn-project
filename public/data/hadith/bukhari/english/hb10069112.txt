10 | 69 | 112 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed two rak`at (instead of four) and finished his prayer. Dhul-Yadain askedhim whether the prayer had been reduced or whether he had forgotten. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked thepeople whether Dhul-Yadain was telling the truth. The people replied in the affirmative. Then Allah'sApostle stood up, offered the remaining two rak`at and then finished his prayer with Taslim and thensaid, "Allahu Akbar." He followed it with two prostrations like ordinary prostrations or a bit longer.

18 | 20 | 39 | Narrated `Aisha: (the mother of the faithful believers) Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (in his last days) used to pray sitting. He wouldrecite while sitting, and when thirty or forty verses remained from the recitation he would get up andrecite them while standing and then he would bow and prostrate. He used to do the same in the secondrak`a. After finishing the Prayer he used to look at me and if I was awake he would talk to me and if Iwas asleep, he would lie down.

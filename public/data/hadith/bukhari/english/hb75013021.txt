75 | 13 | 21 | Narrated Sa`d: I became seriously ill at Mecca and the Prophet (ﷺ) came to visit me. I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I shallleave behind me a good fortune, but my heir is my only daughter; shall I bequeath two third of myproperty to be spent in charity and leave one third (for my heir)?" He said, "No." I said, "Shall Ibequeath half and leave half?" He said, "No." I said, "Shall I bequeath one third and leave two thirds?"He said, "One third is alright, though even one third is too much." Then he placed his hand on hisforehead and passed it over my face and `Abdomen and said, "O Allah! Cure Sa`d and complete hisemigration." I feel as if I have been feeling the coldness of his hand on my liver ever since.

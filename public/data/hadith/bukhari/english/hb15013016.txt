15 | 13 | 16 | Narrated Masruq: One day I went to Ibn Mas`ud who said, "When Quraish delayed in embracing Islam, the Prophet (ﷺ) Iinvoked Allah to curse them, so they were afflicted with a (famine) year because of which many ofthem died and they ate the carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, 'O Muhammad!You came to order people to keep good relation with kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed,so invoke Allah I ? So the Prophet (ﷺ) I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: 'Then watch you Forthe day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.' (44.10) When the famine wastaken off, the people renegade once again as nonbelievers. The statement of Allah, (in Sura "Ad-Dukhan"-44) refers to that: 'On the day when We shall seize You with a mighty grasp.' (44.16) Andthat was what happened on the day of the battle of Badr." Asbath added on the authority of Mansur,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the people complained of theexcessive rain. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'O Allah! (Let it rain) around us and not on us.' So the cloudsdispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings."

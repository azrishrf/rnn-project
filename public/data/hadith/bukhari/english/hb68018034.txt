68 | 18 | 34 | Narrated Nafi`: Whenever Ibn `Umar was asked about marrying a Christian lady or a Jewess, he would say: "Allahhas made it unlawful for the believers to marry ladies who ascribe partners in worship to Allah, and Ido not know of a greater thing, as regards to ascribing partners in worship, etc. to Allah, than that alady should say that Jesus is her Lord although he is just one of Allah's slaves."

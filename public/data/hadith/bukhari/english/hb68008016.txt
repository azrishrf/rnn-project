68 | 8 | 16 | Narrated `Aisha: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was fond of honey and sweet edible things and (it was his habit) that after finishingthe `Asr prayer he would visit his wives and stay with one of them at that time. Once he went toHafsa, the daughter of `Umar and stayed with her more than usual. I got jealous and asked the reasonfor that. I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and thatshe made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet (ﷺ) to drink (and that was the reason for the delay). Isaid, "By Allah we will play a trick on him (to prevent him from doing so)." So I said to Sa`da bintZam`a "The Prophet (ﷺ) will approach you, and when he comes near you, say: 'Have you taken Maghafir(a bad-smelling gum)?' He will say, 'No.' Then say to him: 'Then what is this bad smell which i smellfrom you?' He will say to you, 'Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.' Then say: Perhaps the bees of thathoney had sucked the juice of the tree of Al-`Urfut.' I shall also say the same. O you, Safiyya, say thesame." Later Sa`da said, "By Allah, as soon as he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) stood at the door, I was about to sayto him what you had ordered me to say because I was afraid of you." So when the Prophet (ﷺ) came nearSa`da, she said to him, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you taken Maghafir?" He said, "No." She said."Then what is this bad smell which I detect on you?" He said, "Hafsa made me drink honey syrup."She said, "Perhaps its bees had sucked the juice of Al-`Urfut tree." When he came to me, I also saidthe same, and when he went to Safiyya, she also said the same. And when the Prophet (ﷺ) again went toHafsa, she said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I give you more of that drink?" He said, "I am not in need ofit." Sa`da said, "By Allah, we deprived him (of it)." I said to her, "Keep quiet." '

82 | 1 | 2 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Allah puts an angel in charge of the uterus and the angel says, 'O Lord, (it is)semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O Lord, (it is now) a piece of flesh.' And then, if Allah wishes tocomplete its creation, the angel asks, 'O Lord, (will it be) a male or a female? A wretched (an evildoer) or a blessed (doer of good)? How much will his provisions be? What will his age be?' So all thatis written while the creature is still in the mother's womb."

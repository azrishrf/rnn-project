61 | 25 | 103 | Narrated Abu Musa: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "In a dream I saw myself migrating from Mecca to a place having plenty of datetrees. I thought that it was Al-Yamama or Hajar, but it came to be Medina i.e. Yathrib. In the samedream I saw myself moving a sword and its blade got broken. It came to symbolize the defeat whichthe Muslims suffered from, on the Day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal asbefore, and that was the symbol of the victory Allah bestowed upon Muslims and their gatheringtogether. I saw cows in my dream, and by Allah, that was a blessing, and they symbolized thebelievers on the Day of Uhud. And the blessing was the good Allah bestowed upon us and the rewardof true belief which Allah gave us after the day of Badr.

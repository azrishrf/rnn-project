59 | 11 | 101 | Narrated Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas: Once `Umar asked the leave to see Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in whose company there were some Quraishiwomen who were talking to him and asking him for more financial support raising their voices. When`Umar asked permission to enter the women got up (quickly) hurrying to screen themselves. WhenAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) admitted `Umar, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was smiling, `Umar asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! MayAllah keep you in happiness always." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "I am astonished at these women who were withme. As soon as they heard your voice, they hastened to screen themselves." `Umar said, "O Allah'sApostle! You have more right to be feared by them." Then he addressed (those women) saying, "Oenemies of your own souls! Do you fear me and not Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?" They replied. "Yes, for you area fearful and fierce man as compared with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)." On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to `Umar),"By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whenever Satan sees you taking a path, he follows a path otherthan yours."

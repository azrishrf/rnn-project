78 | 72 | 128 | Narrated `Aisha: The Prophet (ﷺ) did something and allowed his people to do it, but some people refrained from doing it. When the Prophet (ﷺ) learned of that, he delivered a sermon, and after having sent Praises to Allah, he said, "What is wrong with such people as refrain from doing a thing that I do? By Allah, I know Allah better than they, and I am more afraid of Him than they."

93 | 4 | 7 | Narrated `Ali: The Prophet (ﷺ) sent an army unit (for some campaign) and appointed a man from the Ansar as itscommander and ordered them (the soldiers) to obey him. (During the campaign) he became angrywith them and said, "Didn't the Prophet (ﷺ) order you to obey me?" They said, "Yes." He said, "I orderyou to collect wood and make a fire and then throw yourselves into it." So they collected wood andmade a fire, but when they were about to throw themselves into, it they started looking at each other,and some of them said, "We followed the Prophet (ﷺ) to escape from the fire. How should we enter itnow?" So while they were in that state, the fire extinguished and their commander's anger abated. Theevent was mentioned to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said, "If they had entered it (the fire) they would neverhave come out of it, for obedience is required only in what is good."

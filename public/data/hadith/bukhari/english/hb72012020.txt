72 | 12 | 20 | Narrated Jabir: We went out in a campaign and the army was called The Army of the Khabt, and Abu 'Ubaida wasour commander. We were struck with severe hunger. Then the sea threw a huge dead fish called Al-`Anbar, the like of which had never been seen. We ate of it for half a month, and then Abu 'Ubaidatook one of its bones (and made an arch of it) so that a rider could easily pass under it.

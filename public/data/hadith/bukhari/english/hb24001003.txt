24 | 1 | 3 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Abu Bakr said, "By Allah! I will fight those who differentiate between the prayer and the Zakat as Zakat is the compulsory right to be takenfrom the property (according to Allah's orders) By Allah! If they refuse to pay me even a she-kidwhich they used to pay at the time of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) . I would fight with them for withholding it"Then `Umar said, "By Allah, it was nothing, but Allah opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision(to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right."

24 | 36 | 59 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: A Bedouin asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about the emigration. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "May Allah havemercy on you! The matter of emigration is very hard. Have you got camels? Do you pay their Zakat?"The Bedouin said, "Yes, I have camels and I pay their Zakat." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, Work beyond theseas and Allah will not decrease (waste) any of your good deeds."

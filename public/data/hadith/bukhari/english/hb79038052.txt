So he sat beside Abu Ad-Darda' who asked,"From where are you?" He said, "From the people of Kufa." Abu Darda' said, "Wasn't there amongyou the person who keeps the secrets (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) which nobody knew except him (i.e., Hudhaifa(bin Al-Yaman)). And isn't there among you the person whom Allah gave refuge from Satan throughthe request (tongue) of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? (i.e., `Ammar). Isn't there among you the one who used tocarry the Siwak and the cushion (or pillows (of the Prophets)? (i.e., Ibn Mas`ud). How did Ibn Mas`uduse to recite 'By the night as it conceals (the light)?" (Sura 92). 'Alqama said, "Wadhdhakari WalUntha' (And by male and female.") Abu Ad-Darda added. 'These people continued to argue with meregarding it till they were about to cause me to have doubts although I heard it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)."

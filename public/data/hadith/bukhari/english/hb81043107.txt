81 | 43 | 107 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Two men, a Muslim and a Jew, abused each other. The Muslim said, "By Him Who gave superiorityto Muhammad over all the people." On that, the Jew said, "By Him Who gave superiority to Mosesover all the people." The Muslim became furious at that and slapped the Jew in the face. The Jew wentto Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and informed him of what had happened between him and the Muslim. Allah'sApostle said, "Don't give me superiority over Moses, for the people will fall unconscious on the Dayof Resurrection and I will be the first to gain consciousness, and behold ! Moses will be there holdingthe side of Allah's Throne. I will not know whether Moses has been among those people who havebecome unconscious and then has regained consciousness before me, or has been among thoseexempted by Allah from falling unconscious."

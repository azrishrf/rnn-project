75 | 18 | 31 | Narrated As-Sa'ib: My aunt took me to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! My nephew is- ill." The Prophet (ﷺ)touched my head with his hand and invoked Allah to bless me. He then performed ablution and Idrank of the remaining water of his ablution and then stood behind his back and saw "Khatam An-Nubuwwa" (The Seal of Prophethood) between his shoulders like a button of a tent.

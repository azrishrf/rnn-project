81 | 49 | 126 | Narrated `Adi bin Hatim: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "There will be none among you but will be talked to by Allah on the Day ofResurrection, without there being an interpreter between him and Him (Allah) . He will look and seenothing ahead of him, and then he will look (again for the second time) in front of him, and the (Hell)Fire will confront him. So, whoever among you can save himself from the Fire, should do so evenwith one half of a date (to give in charity).

75 | 6 | 12 | Narrated 'Ata bin Abi Rabah: Ibn `Abbas said to me, "Shall I show you a woman of the people of Paradise?" I said, "Yes." He said,"This black lady came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, 'I get attacks of epilepsy and my body becomesuncovered; please invoke Allah for me.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to her), 'If you wish, be patient and you willhave (enter) Paradise; and if you wish, I will invoke Allah to cure you.' She said, 'I will remainpatient,' and added, 'but I become uncovered, so please invoke Allah for me that I may not becomeuncovered.' So he invoked Allah for her."

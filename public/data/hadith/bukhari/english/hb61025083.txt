61 | 25 | 83 | Narrated `Abdullah: We used to consider miracles as Allah's Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning.Once we were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, "Bring the waterremaining with you." The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in itand said, "Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah." I saw the water flowing fromamong the fingers of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it wasbeing eaten (by him).

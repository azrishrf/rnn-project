57 | 5 | 21 | Narrated Ibn Al-Hanafiya: If `Ali had spoken anything bad about `Uthman then he would have mentioned the day when somepersons came to him and complained about the Zakat officials of `Uthman. `Ali then said to me, "Goto `Uthman and say to him, 'This document contains the regulations of spending the Sadaqa of Allah'sApostle so order your Zakat officials to act accordingly." I took the document to `Uthman. `Uthmansaid, "Take it away, for we are not in need of it." I returned to `Ali with it and informed him of that.He said, "Put it whence you took it."

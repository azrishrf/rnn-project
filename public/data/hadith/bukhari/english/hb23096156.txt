23 | 96 | 156 | Narrated `Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi: I saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, "O `Abdullah bin `Umar! Go to themother of the believers Aisha and say, `Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,' and requesther to allow me to be buried with my companions." (So, Ibn `Umar conveyed the message to `Aisha.)She said, "I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (`Umar) to myself (andallow him to be buried there)." When `Abdullah bin `Umar returned, `Umar asked him, "What (news)do you have?" He replied, "O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there)." Onthat `Umar said, "Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, whenI expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (`Aisha ) and say, `Umar bin Al-Khattab askspermission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to thegraveyard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those withwhom Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by thepeople after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him," and then hementioned the name of `Uthman, `Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf and Sa`d bin AbiWaqqas.By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, "O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah'sglad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and youruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this." `Umar replied, "O son ofmy brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neitherlose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize theirrights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansarwho before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of therighteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rulesand regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill theircontracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities."

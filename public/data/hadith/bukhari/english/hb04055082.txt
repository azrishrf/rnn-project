4 | 55 | 82 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Once the Prophet, while passing through one of the graveyards of Medina or Mecca heard the voicesof two persons who were being tortured in their graves. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "These two persons arebeing tortured not for a major sin (to avoid)." The Prophet (ﷺ) then added, "Yes! (they are being torturedfor a major sin). Indeed, one of them never saved himself from being soiled with his urine while theother used to go about with calumnies (to make enmity between friends). The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked for agreen leaf of a date-palm tree, broke it into two pieces and put one on each grave. On being asked whyhe had done so, he replied, "I hope that their torture might be lessened, till these get dried."

The man was watering his garden then. He said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have waterkept overnight; let us go to the shade." So he took them both there and poured water into a bowl andmilked a domestic goat of his in it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) drank, and then the man who had come along withhim, drank.

7 | 9 | 15 | Narrated `Imran bin Husain Al-Khuza`i: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw a person sitting aloof and not praying with the people. He asked him, "O so andso! What prevented you from offering the prayer with the people?" He replied, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Iam Junub and there is no water." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Perform Tayammum with clean earth and thatwill be sufficient for you."

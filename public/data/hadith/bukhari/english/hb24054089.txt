24 | 54 | 89 | Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi: We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) and when we arrived at theWadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked his companions to estimate theamount of the fruits in the garden, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60Sa's) and 1 Sa'= 3 kg. approximately). The Prophet (ﷺ) said to that lady, "Check what your garden willyield." When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "There will be a strong wind tonight and so no oneshould stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it." So we fastened our camels. A strong windblew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Ailasent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to the Prophet (ﷺ) as a present, and wrote to the Prophet (ﷺ) that hispeople would stay in their place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet (ﷺ) reached Wadi-al-Qura he asked that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, "Ten Awsuq," and that waswhat Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had estimated. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I want to reach Medina quickly, andwhoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up." The sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar saidsomething which meant: When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw Medina he said, "This is Taba." And whenhe saw the mountain of Uhud, he said, "This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of thebest amongst the Ansar?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "The family of Bani-n-Najjar, andthen the family of Bani Sa`ida or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned are the best)but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar."

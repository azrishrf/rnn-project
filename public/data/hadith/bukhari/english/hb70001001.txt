70 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Once while I was in a state of fatigue (because of severe hunger), Imet 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, so I asked him to recite a verse fromAllah's Book to me. He entered his house and interpreted it to me.(Then I went out and) after walking for a short distance, I fell on myface because of fatigue and severe hunger. Suddenly I saw Allah'sApostlestanding by my head. He said, "O Abu Huraira!" I replied,"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ï·º), and Sadaik!" Then he held me by the hand,and made me get up. Then he came to know what I was suffering from. Hetook me to his house, and ordered a big bowl of milk for me. I drankthereof and he said, "Drink more, O Abu Hirr!" So I drank again,whereupon he again said, "Drink more." So I drank more till my bellybecame full and looked like a bowl. Afterwards I met 'Umar andmentioned to him what had happened to me, and said to him, "Somebody,who had more right than you, O 'Umar, took over the case. By Allah, Iasked you to recite a Verse to me while I knew it better than you." Onthat Umar said to me, "By Allah, if I admitted and entertained you, itwould have been dearer to me than having nice red camels.

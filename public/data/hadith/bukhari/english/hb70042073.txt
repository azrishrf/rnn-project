The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "There is atree among the trees which is as blessed as a Muslim" I thought that it was the date palm tree andintended to say, "It is the date-palm tree, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" but I looked behind to see that I was thetenth and youngest of ten men present there, so I kept quiet' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "It is the datepalmtree."

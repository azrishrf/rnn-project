11 | 19 | 35 | Narrated Salman Al-Farsi: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (p.b.u.h) said, "Anyone who takes a bath on Friday and cleans himself as much as hecan and puts oil (on his hair) or scents himself; and then proceeds for the prayer and does not force hisway between two persons (assembled in the mosque for the Friday prayer), and prays as much as iswritten for him and remains quiet when the Imam delivers the Khutba, all his sins in between thepresent and the last Friday will be forgiven."

Ibn `Umar used to say in such a case, "Themanumitted should manumit the slave completely if he has sufficient money to pay the rest of theprice of that slave (which is to be justly estimated) and the other shareholders are to take the price oftheir shares and the slave is freed (released from slavery)." Ibn `Umar narrated this verdict from theProphet.

70 | 20 | 36 | Narrated `Amr bin Umaiyya: that he saw the Prophet (ï·º) holding a shoulder piece of mutton in his hand and cutting part of it with aknife. Then he was called for the prayer whereupon he put down the shoulder piece and the knife withwhich he was cutting it, and then stood for prayer without performing ablution again.

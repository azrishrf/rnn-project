80 | 29 | 45 | Narrated `Aisha: When Allah's Messenger (ï·º) was healthy, he used to say, "No prophet dies till he is shown his place inParadise, and then he is given the option (to live or die)." So when death approached him(during hisillness), and while his head was on my thigh, he became unconscious for a while, and when herecovered, he fixed his eyes on the ceiling and said, "O Allah! (Let me join) the Highest Companions(see Qur'an 4:69)," I said, "So, he does not choose us." Then I realized that it was the application ofthe statement he used to relate to us when he was healthy. So that was his last utterance (before hedied), i.e. "O Allah! (Let me join) the Highest Companions."

82 | 16 | 27 | Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib: I saw the Prophet (ï·º) on the Day of (the battle of) Al-Khandaq, carrying earth with us and saying, "ByAllah, without Allah we would not have been guided, neither would we have fasted, nor would wehave prayed. O Allah! Send down Sakina (calmness) upon us and make our feet firm when we meet(the enemy). The pagans have rebelled against us, but if they want to put us in affliction (i.e., fight us)we refuse (to flee)."

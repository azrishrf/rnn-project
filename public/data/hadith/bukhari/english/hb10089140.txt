10 | 89 | 140 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to keep silent between the Takbir and the recitation of Qur'an and that interval ofsilence used to be a short one. I said to the Prophet (ﷺ) "May my parents be sacrificed for you! What doyou say in the pause between Takbir and recitation?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I say, 'Allahumma, baa`idbaini wa baina khatayaya kama baa`adta baina l-mashriqi wa l-maghrib. Allahumma, naqqini minkhatayaya kama yunaqqa th-thawbu l-abyadu mina d-danas. Allahumma, ighsil khatayaya bi l-maa'iwa th-thalji wa l-barad (O Allah! Set me apart from my sins (faults) as the East and West are set apartfrom each other and clean me from sins as a white garment is cleaned of dirt (after thorough washing).O Allah! Wash off my sins with water, snow and hail.)"

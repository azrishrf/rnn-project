81 | 51 | 152 | Narrated Anas: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Allah will gather all the people on the Day of Resurrection and they will say,'Let us request someone to intercede for us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from this place ofours.'Then they will go to Adam and say, 'You are the one whom Allah created with His Own Hands, andbreathed in you of His soul, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you; so please intercede for us withour Lord.' Adam will reply, 'I am not fit for this undertaking, and will remember his sin, and will say,'Go to Noah, the first Apostle sent by Allah'They will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking', and will remember his sin andsay, 'Go to Abraham whom Allah took as a Khalil.They will go to him (and request similarly). He will reply, 'I am not fit for this undertaking,' and willremember his sin and say, 'Go to Moses to whom Allah spoke directly.'They will go to Moses and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking,' and will remember his sinand say, 'Go to Jesus.'They will go to him, and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad as Allah hasforgiven his past and future sins.'They will come to me and I will ask my Lord's permission, and when I see Him, I will fall down inprostration to Him, and He will leave me in that state as long as (He) Allah will, and then I will beaddressed. 'Raise up your head (O Muhammad)! Ask, and your request will be granted, and say, andyour saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.' Then I will raise myhead, and I will glorify and praise my Lord with a saying(i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then Iwill intercede, Allah will fix a limit for me (i.e., certain type of people for whom I may intercede), andI will take them out of the (Hell) Fire and let them enter Paradise. Then I will come back (to Allah)and fall in prostration, and will do the same for the third and fourth times till no-one remains in the(Hell) Fire except those whom the Qur'an has imprisoned therein." (The sub-narrator, Qatada used tosay at that point, "...those upon whom eternity (in Hell) has been imposed.")

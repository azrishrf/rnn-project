81 | 45 | 111 | Narrated `Abdullah: While we were in the company of the Prophet (ï·º) in a tent he said, ''Would it please you to be one fourthof the people of Paradise?" We said, "Yes." He said, "Would It please you to be one-third of thepeople of Paradise?" We said, "Yes." He said, "Would it please you to be half of the people ofParadise?" We said, "Yes." Thereupon he said, "I hope that you will be one half of the people ofParadise, for none will enter Paradise but a Muslim soul, and you people, in comparison to the peoplewho associate others in worship with Allah, are like a white hair on the skin of a black ox, or a blackhair on the skin of a red ox."

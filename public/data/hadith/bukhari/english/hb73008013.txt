73 | 8 | 13 | Narrated Al-Bara': Abu Burda slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the (`Id) prayer whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him,"Slaughter another sacrifice instead of that." Abu Burda said, "I have nothing except a Jadha'a."(Shu`ba said: Perhaps Abu Burda also said that Jadha'a was better than an old sheep in his opinion.)The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "(Never mind), slaughter it to make up for the other one, but it will not be sufficientfor anyone else after you."

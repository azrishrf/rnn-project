The Prophet (ﷺ) invited the people to those mastigures and they were eaten on his diningsheet, but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not eat of it, as if he disliked it. Nevertheless. if it was unlawful to eat that,the people would not have eaten it on the dining sheet of the Prophet (ﷺ) nor would he have ordered thatthey be eaten.

54 | 10 | 14 | Narrated Aiman Al-Makki: When I visited Aisha she said, "Buraira who had a written contract for her emancipation for a certainamount came to me and said, "O mother of the believers! Buy me and manumit me, as my masterswill sell me." Aisha agreed to it. Buraira said, 'My masters will sell me on the condition that my Walawill go to them." Aisha said to her, 'Then I am not in need of you.' The Prophet (ﷺ) heard of that or wastold about it and so he asked Aisha, 'What is the problem of Buraira?' He said, 'Buy her and manumither, no matter what they stipulate.' Aisha added, 'I bought and manumitted her, though her mastershad stipulated that her Wala would be for them.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, The Wala is for the liberator, evenif the other stipulated a hundred conditions."

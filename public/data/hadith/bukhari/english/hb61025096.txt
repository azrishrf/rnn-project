61 | 25 | 96 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "There will be afflictions (and at the time) the sitting person will be better thanthe standing one, and the standing one will be better than the walking, and the walking will be betterthan the running. And whoever will look towards those afflictions, they will overtake him, andwhoever will find a refuge or a shelter, should take refuge in it." The same narration is reported byAbu Bakr, with the addition, "(The Prophet (ﷺ) said), 'Among the prayers there is a prayer the missing ofwhich will be to one like losing one's family and property."

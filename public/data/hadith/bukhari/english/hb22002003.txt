22 | 2 | 3 | Narrated' `Abdullah: Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered five rak`at in the Zuhr prayer, and somebody asked him whether therewas some increase in the prayer. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "What is that?" He said, "You have offered fiverak`at." So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) performed two prostrations of Sahu after Taslim.

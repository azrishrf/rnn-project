19 | 5 | 7 | Narrated `Aisha the mother of the faithful believers: One night Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered the prayer in the Mosque and the people followed him. The nextnight he also offered the prayer and too many people gathered. On the third and the fourth nights morepeople gathered, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not come out to them. In the morning he said, "I saw whatyou were doing and nothing but the fear that it (i.e. the prayer) might be enjoined on you, stopped mefrom coming to you." And that happened in the month of Ramadan.

91 | 22 | 31 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "I have been sent with Jawami al-Kalim (i.e., the shortest expressioncarrying the widest meanings), and I was made victorious with awe (caste into the hearts of theenemy), and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the earth were brought to me and wereput in my hand." Muhammad said, Jawami'-al-Kalim means that Allah expresses in one or twostatements or thereabouts the numerous matters that used to be written in the books revealed before(the coming of) the Prophet (ﷺ) .

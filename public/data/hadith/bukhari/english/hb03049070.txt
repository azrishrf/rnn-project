3 | 49 | 70 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: "Once Mu`adh was along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as a companion rider. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "O Mu`adhbin Jabal." Mu`adh replied, "Labbaik and Sa`daik. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" Again the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "OMu`adh!" Mu`adh said thrice, "Labbaik and Sa`daik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Thereis none who testifies sincerely that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad ishis Apostle, except that Allah, will save him from the Hell-fire." Mu`adh said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) !Should I not inform the people about it so that they may have glad tidings?" He replied, "When thepeople hear about it, they will solely depend on it." Then Mu`adh narrated the above-mentionedHadith just before his death, being afraid of committing sin (by not telling the knowledge).

11 | 40 | 63 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: There was a woman amongst us who had a farm and she used to sow Silq (a kind of vegetable) on theedges of streams in her farm. On Fridays she used to pull out the Silq from its roots and put the rootsin a utensil. Then she would put a handful of powdered barley over it and cook it. The roots of the Silqwere a substitute for meat. After finishing the Jumua prayer we used to greet her and she would giveus that food which we would eat with our hands, and because of that meal, we used to look forward toFriday.

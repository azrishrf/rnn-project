93 | 6 | 11 | Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Samura: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "O `Abdur-Rahman bin Samura! Do not seek to be a ruler, for if you are givenauthority on your demand, you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking forit, then you will be helped (by Allah) in it. If you ever take an oath to do something and later on youfind that something else is better, then do what is better and make expiation for your oath."

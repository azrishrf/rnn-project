77 | 6 | 10 | Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet)The wife of Rifa`a Al-Qurazi came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while I was sitting, and Abu Bakr was alsothere. She said, 'O Allah s Apostle! I was the wife of Rifa`a and he divorced me irrevocably. Then Imarried `AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair who, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), has only something like afringe of a garment, Showing the fringe of her veil. Khalid bin Sa`id, who was standing at the door,for he had not been admitted, heard her statement and said, "O Abu Bakr! Why do you not stop thislady from saying such things openly before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" No, by Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) didnothing but smiled. Then he said to the lady, "Perhaps you want to return to Rifa`a? That is impossibleunless `Abdur-Rahman consummates his marriage with you." That became the tradition after him.

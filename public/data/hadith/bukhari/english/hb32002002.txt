In themorning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet (ﷺ) came and addressed us and said, 'I was informed of (thedate of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last tennights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water (as a sign).So, whoever was in I`tikaf with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day's period)', and wereturned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rainedtill rainwater started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm leaf stalks.Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prostrating in mud and water and I saw thetraces of mud on his forehead."

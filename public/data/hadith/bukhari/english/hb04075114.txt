4 | 75 | 114 | Narrated Al-Bara 'bin `Azib: The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, "Whenever you go to bed perform ablution like that for the prayer, lie or yourright side and say, "Allahumma aslamtu wajhi ilaika, wa fauwadtu `Amri ilaika, wa alja'tu Zahri ilaikaraghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika. La Malja'a wa la manja minka illa ilaika. Allahumma amantubikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta wa bina-biyika-l ladhi arsalta" (O Allah! I surrender to You and entrust allmy affairs to You and depend upon You for Your Blessings both with hope and fear of You. There isno fleeing from You, and there is no place of protection and safety except with You O Allah! I believein Your Book (the Qur'an) which You have revealed and in Your Prophet (Muhammad) whom Youhave sent). Then if you die on that very night, you will die with faith (i.e. or the religion of Islam). Letthe aforesaid words be your last utterance (before sleep)." I repeated it before the Prophet (ﷺ) and when Ireached "Allahumma amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta (O Allah I believe in Your Book which Youhave revealed)." I said, "Wa-rasulika (and your Apostle)." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "No, (but say):'Wanabiyika-l-ladhi arsalta (Your Prophet whom You have sent), instead."

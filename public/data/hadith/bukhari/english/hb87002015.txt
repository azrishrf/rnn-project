87 | 2 | 15 | Narrated Usama bin Zaid bin Haritha: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent us (to fight) against Al-Huraqa (one of the sub-tribes) of Juhaina. We reachedthose people in the morning and defeated them. A man from the Ansar and I chased one of their menand when we attacked him, he said, "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah." The Ansarirefrained from killing him but I stabbed him with my spear till I killed him. When we reached(Medina), this news reached the Prophet. He said to me, "O Usama! You killed him after he had said,'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah?"' I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He said so in order tosave himself." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "You killed him after he had said, 'None has the right to beworshipped but Allah." The Prophet (ﷺ) kept on repeating that statement till I wished I had not been aMuslim before that day.

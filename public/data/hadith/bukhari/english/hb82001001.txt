82 | 1 | 1 | Narrated `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ï·º), the truthful and truly-inspired, said, "Each one of you collected in the womb of hismother for forty days, and then turns into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into apiece of flesh for a similar period (of forty days) and then Allah sends an angel and orders him towrite four things, i.e., his provision, his age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the blessed (inthe Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him. And by Allah, a person among you (or a man) maydo deeds of the people of the Fire till there is only a cubit or an arm-breadth distance between him andthe Fire, but then that writing (which Allah has ordered the angel to write) precedes, and he does thedeeds of the people of Paradise and enters it; and a man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise tillthere is only a cubit or two between him and Paradise, and then that writing precedes and he does thedeeds of the people of the Fire and enters it."

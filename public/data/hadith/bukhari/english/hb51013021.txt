51 | 13 | 21 | Narrated 'Amir: I heard An-Nu`man bin Bashir on the pulpit saying, "My father gave me a gift but `Amra bint Rawaha(my mother) said that she would not agree to it unless he made Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as a witness to it. So,my father went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, 'I have given a gift to my son from `Amra bint Rawaha,but she ordered me to make you as a witness to it, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, 'Haveyou given (the like of it) to everyone of your sons?' He replied in the negative. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said,'Be afraid of Allah, and be just to your children.' My father then returned and took back his gift."

76 | 39 | 64 | Narrated Abu Sa`id: A group of the companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) proceeded on a journey till they dismounted near one ofthe Arab tribes and requested them to entertain them as their guests, but they (the tribe people) refusedto entertain them. Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and hewas given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of them said, "Will you go to the group (thosetravelers) who have dismounted near you and see if one of them has something useful?" They came tothem and said, "O the group! Our leader has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and wehave treated him with everything but nothing benefited him Has anyone of you anything useful?" Oneof them replied, "Yes, by Allah, I know how to treat with a Ruqya. But. by Allah, we wanted you toreceive us as your guests but you refused. I will not treat your patient with a Ruqya till you fix for ussomething as wages." Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a flock of sheep. The manwent with them (the people of the tribe) and started spitting (on the bite) and reciting Surat-al-Fatihatill the patient was healed and started walking as if he had not been sick. When the tribe people paidthem their wages they had agreed upon, some of them (the Prophet's companions) said, "Distribute(the sheep)." But the one who treated with the Ruqya said, "Do not do that till we go to Allah'sApostle and mention to him what has happened, and see what he will order us." So they came toAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned the story to him and he said, "How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha isa Ruqya? You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have got) and assign for me a share withyou."

64 | 38 | 279 | Narrated Yazid bin Abi Ubaid: I saw the trace of a wound in Salama's leg. I said to him, "O Abu Muslim! What is this wound?" He said, "This was inflicted on me on the day of Khaibar and the people said, 'Salama has been wounded.' Then I went to the Prophet (ï·º) and he puffed his saliva in it (i.e. the wound) thrice., and since then I have not had any pain in it till this hour."

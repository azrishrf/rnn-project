The Jews accepted and carried out the work. Hethen asked, Who will work for me from midday up to the `Asr prayer for one Qirat?' The Christiansaccepted and fulfilled the work. He then said, 'Who will work for me from the `Asr till sunset for twoQirats?' You, Muslims have accepted the offer. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, 'Whyshould we work more and get lesser wages?' (Allah) said, 'Have I withheld part of your right?' Theyreplied in the negative. He said, 'It is My Blessing, I bestow upon whomever I wish .'

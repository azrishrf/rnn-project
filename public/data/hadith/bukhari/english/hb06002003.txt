6 | 2 | 3 | Narrated `Urwa: A person asked me, "Can a woman in menses serve me? And can a Junub woman come close to me?"I replied, "All this is easy for me. All of them can serve me, and there is no harm for any other personto do the same. `Aisha told me that she used to comb the hair of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) while she was in hermenses, and he was in I`tikaf (in the mosque). He would bring his head near her in her room and shewould comb his hair, while she used to be in her menses."

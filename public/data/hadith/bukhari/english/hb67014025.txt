Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked at her. He looked at her carefully and fixed hisglance on her and then lowered his head. When the lady saw that he did not say anything, she satdown. A man from his companions got up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If you are not in need of her,then marry her to me." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Have you got anything to offer?" The man said, "No, byAllah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Go to your family and see if you havesomething." The man went and returned, saying, "No, by Allah, I have not found anything." Allah'sApostle said, "(Go again) and look for something, even if it is an iron ring." He went again andreturned, saying, "No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I could not find even an iron ring, but this is myIzar (waist sheet)." He had no rida. He added, "I give half of it to her." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Whatwill she do with your Izar? If you wear it, she will be naked, and if she wears it, you will be naked."So that man sat down for a long while and then got up (to depart). When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw himgoing, he ordered that he be called back. When he came, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "How much of the Qur'ando you know?" He said, "I know such Sura and such Sura," counting them. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do youknow them by heart?" He replied, "Yes." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Go, I marry her to you for that much ofthe Qur'an which you have."

52 | 5 | 5 | Narrated `Umar bin Al-Khattab: People were (sometimes) judged by the revealing of a Divine Inspiration during the lifetime of Allah'sApostle but now there is no longer any more (new revelation). Now we judge you by the deeds youpractice publicly, so we will trust and favor the one who does good deeds in front of us, and we willnot call him to account about what he is really doing in secret, for Allah will judge him for that; butwe will not trust or believe the one who presents to us with an evil deed even if he claims that hisintentions were good.

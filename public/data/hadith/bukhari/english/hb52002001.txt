52 | 2 | 1 | Narrated `Urwa bin Al-Musaiyab Alqama bin Waqqas and Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah: About the story of `Aisha and their narrations were similar attesting each other, when the liars saidwhat they invented about `Aisha, and the Divine Inspiration was delayed, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for `Aliand Usama to consult them in divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama said, "Keep your wife, as weknow nothing about her except good." Buraira said, "I cannot accuse her of any defect except that sheis still a young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family's dough which the domestic goats come to eat(i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive her husband)." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Who can help me totake revenge over the man who has harmed me by defaming the reputation of my family? By Allah, Ihave not known about my family-anything except good, and they mentioned (i.e. accused) a manabout whom I did not know anything except good."

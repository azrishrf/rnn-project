81 | 26 | 73 | Narrated Abu Musa: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said. "My example and the example of the message with which Allah has sent me islike that of a man who came to some people and said, "I have seen with my own eyes the enemyforces, and I am a naked warner (to you) so save yourself, save yourself! A group of them obeyed himand went out at night, slowly and stealthily and were safe, while another group did not believe himand thus the army took them in the morning and destroyed them."

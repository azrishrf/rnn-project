66 | 17 | 43 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Your life in comparison to the lifetime of the past nations is like the periodbetween the time of `Asr prayer and sunset. Your example and the example of the Jews and Christiansis that of person who employed laborers and said to them, "Who will work for me till the middle ofthe day for one Qirat (a special weight)?' The Jews did. He then said, "Who will work for me from themiddle of the day till the `Asr prayer for one Qirat each?" The Christians worked accordingly. Thenyou (Muslims) are working from the `Asr prayer till the Maghrib prayer for two Qirats each. They (theJews and the Christians) said, 'We did more labor but took less wages.' He (Allah) said, 'Have Iwronged you in your rights?' They replied, 'No.' Then He said, 'This is My Blessing which I give towhom I wish."

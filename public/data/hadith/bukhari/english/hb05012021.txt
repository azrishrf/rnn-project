5 | 12 | 21 | Narrated Qatada: Anas bin Malik said, "The Prophet (ﷺ) used to visit all his wives in a round, during the day and night andthey were eleven in number." I asked Anas, "Had the Prophet (ﷺ) the strength for it?" Anas replied, "Weused to say that the Prophet (ﷺ) was given the strength of thirty (men)." And Sa`id said on the authority ofQatada that Anas had told him about nine wives only (not eleven).

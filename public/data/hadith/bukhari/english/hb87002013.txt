87 | 2 | 13 | Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais: I went to help that man (i.e., `Ali), and on the way I met Abu Bakra who asked me, "Where are yougoing?" I replied, "I am going to help that man." He said, "Go back, for I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)saying, 'If two Muslims meet each other with their swords then (both) the killer and the killed one arein the (Hell) Fire.' I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! It is alright for the killer, but what about the killed one?'He said, 'The killed one was eager to kill his opponent."

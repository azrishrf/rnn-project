60 | 37 | 90 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was informed that I have said: "By Allah, I will fast all the days and pray all the nightsas long as I live." On that, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked me. "Are you the one who says: 'I will fast all thedays and pray all the nights as long as I live?' " I said, "Yes, I have said it." He said, "You cannot dothat. So fast (sometimes) and do not fast (sometimes). Pray and sleep. Fast for three days a month, forthe reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten time, and so the fasting of three days a month equalsthe fasting of a year." I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I can do (fast) more than this." He said, "Fast onevery third day. I said: I can do (fast) more than that, He said: "Fast on alternate days and this was thefasting of David which is the most moderate sort of fasting." I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I can do (fast)more than that." He said, "There is nothing better than that."

66 | 13 | 37 | Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: My brother, Qatada bin An-Nau'man said, "A man performed the night prayer late at night in the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ) and he read: 'Say: He is Allah, (the) One,' (112.1) and read nothing besides that. The next morning a man went to the Prophet (ﷺ) ,~ and told him about that . (The Prophet (ﷺ) replied the same as (in Hadith 532) above.)

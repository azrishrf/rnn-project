63 | 1 | 3 | Narrated Ghailan bin Jarir: I asked Anas, "Tell me about the name 'Al-Ansar.; Did you call yourselves by it or did Allah call youby it?" He said, "Allah called us by it." We used to visit Anas (at Basra) and he used to narrate to usthe virtues and deeds of the Ansar, and he used to address me or a person from the tribe of Al-Azd andsay, "Your tribe did so-and-so on such-and-such a day."

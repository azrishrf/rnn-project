The Prophet (came and) stood at the door but did not enter.I said (to him), "I repent to Allah for what (the guilt) I have done." He said, "What is this cushion?" Isaid, "It is for you to sit on and recline on." He said, "The makers of these pictures will be punished onthe Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them, 'Make alive what you have created.' Moreover,the angels do not enter a house where there are pictures.'"

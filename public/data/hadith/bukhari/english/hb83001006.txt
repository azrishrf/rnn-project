83 | 1 | 6 | Narrated Abu Musa: I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) along with a group of Al-Ash`ariyin in order to request him to provide us withmounts. He said, "By Allah, I will not provide you with mounts and I haven't got anything to mountyou on." Then we stayed there as long as Allah wished us to stay, and then three very nice lookingshe-camels were brought to him and he made us ride them. When we left, we, or some of us, said, "ByAllah, we will not be blessed, as we came to the Prophet (ﷺ) asking him for mounts, and he swore that hewould not give us any mounts but then he did give us. So let us go back to the Prophet (ﷺ) and remindhim (of his oath)." When we returned to him (and reminded him of the fact), he said, "I did not giveyou mounts, but it is Allah Who gave you. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath to dosomething and then I find something else than the first, I will make expiation for my oath and do thething which is better (or do something which is better and give the expiation for my oath).

60 | 3 | 14 | Narrated Abu Huraira: We were in the company of the Prophet (ï·º) at a banquet and a cooked (mutton) forearm was set beforehim, and he used to like it. He ate a morsel of it and said, "I will be the chief of all the people on theDay of Resurrection. Do you know how Allah will gather all the first and the last (people) in one levelplace where an observer will be able to see (all) of them and they will be able to hear the announcer,and the sun will come near to them. Some People will say: Don't you see, in what condition you areand the state to which you have reached? Why don't you look for a person who can intercede for youwith your Lord? Some people will say: Appeal to your father, Adam.' They will go to him and say: 'OAdam! You are the father of all mankind, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered theangels to prostrate for you, and made you live in Paradise. Will you not intercede for us with yourLord? Don't you see in what (miserable) state we are, and to what condition we have reached?' On thatAdam will reply, 'My Lord is so angry as He has never been before and will never be in the future;(besides), He forbade me (to eat from) the tree, but I disobeyed (Him), (I am worried about) myself!Myself! Go to somebody else; go to Noah.' They will go to Noah and say; 'O Noah! You are the firstamongst the messengers of Allah to the people of the earth, and Allah named you a thankful slave.Don't you see in what a (miserable) state we are and to what condition we have reached? Will you notintercede for us with your Lord? Noah will reply: 'Today my Lord has become so angry as he hadnever been before and will never be in the future Myself! Myself! Go to the Prophet (Muhammad).The people will come to me, and I will prostrate myself underneath Allah's Throne. Then I will beaddressed: 'O Muhammad! Raise your head; intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask(for anything). for you will be given. "

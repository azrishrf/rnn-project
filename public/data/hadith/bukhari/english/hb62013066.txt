62 | 13 | 66 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair: During the battle of Al-Ahzab, I and `Umar bin Abi-Salama were kept behind with the women.Behold! I saw (my father) Az-Zubair riding his horse, going to and coming from Bani Quraiza twiceor thrice. So when I came back I said, "O my father! I saw you going to and coming from BaniQuraiza?" He said, "Did you really see me, O my son?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said,'Who will go to Bani Quraiza and bring me their news?' So I went, and when I came back, Allah'sApostle mentioned for me both his parents saying, "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you."'

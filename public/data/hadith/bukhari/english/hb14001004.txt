14 | 1 | 4 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept across the bed while Allah'sApostle and his wife slept length-wise. The Prophet (ﷺ) slept till midnight or nearly so and woke uprubbing his face and recited ten verses from Surat "Al-`Imran." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went towards a leatherskin and performed ablution in the most perfect way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same andstood beside him. The Prophet (ﷺ) put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and then prayed tworak`at five times and then ended his prayer with witr. He laid down till the Mu'adh-dhin came then hestood up and offered two rak`at (Sunnah of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr prayer.(See Hadith 183)

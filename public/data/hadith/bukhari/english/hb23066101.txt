23 | 66 | 101 | Narrated Sulaiman Ash-Shaibani: I heard Ash-Shu`bi saying, "I was told by a man who had passed with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) by a gravethat was separate from the other graves that he (the Prophet (ï·º) ) led them in the prayer and they prayedbehind him." I said, "O Abu `Amr! Who narrated that to you?" He replied, "Ibn `Abbas."

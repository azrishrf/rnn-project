10 | 73 | 118 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Martyrs are those who die because of drowning, plague, an Abdominal disease, orof being buried alive by a falling building." And then he added, "If the people knew the Reward forthe Zuhr prayer in its early time, they would race for it. If they knew the reward for the `Isha' and theFajr prayers in congregation, they would join them even if they had to crawl. If they knew the rewardfor the first row, they would draw lots for it."

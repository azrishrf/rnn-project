25 | 146 | 239 | Narrated `Abdul-Aziz bin Rufai: I asked Anas bin Malik, "Tell me something you have observed about the Prophet (ï·º) concerning where he offered the Zuhr prayer on the Day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja)." Anas replied, "He offered it at Mina." I said, "Where did he offer the `Asr prayer on the Day of Nafr (day of departure from Mina)?" He replied, "At Al-Abtah," and added, "You should do as your leaders do."

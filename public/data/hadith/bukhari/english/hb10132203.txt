10 | 132 | 203 | Narrated Abu Wail: Hudhaifa said, "I saw a person not performing his bowing and prostrations perfectly. When hecompleted the prayer, I told him that he had not prayed." I think that Hudhaifa added (i.e. said to theman), "Had you died, you would have died on a tradition other than that of the Prophet (ï·º) Muhammad."

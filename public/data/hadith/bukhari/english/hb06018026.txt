When we reached Mecca, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Those who had assumed the lhramfor `Umra and had not brought the Hadi should finish his lhram and whoever had assumed the Ihramfor `Umra and brought the Hadi should not finish the Ihram till he has slaughtered his Hadi andwhoever had assumed the lhram for Hajj should complete his Hajj." `Aisha further said, "I got myperiods (menses) and kept on menstruating till the day of `Arafat, and I had assumed the Ihram for`Umra only (Tamattu`). The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered me to undo and comb my head hair and assume thelhram for Hajj only and leave the `Umra. I did the same till I completed the Hajj. Then the Prophet (ﷺ)sent `Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me and ordered me to perform `Umra from at-Tan`im in lieuof the missed `Umra."

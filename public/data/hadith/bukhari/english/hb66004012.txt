66 | 4 | 12 | Narrated Zaid bin Thabit: Abu Bakr sent for me and said, "You used to write the Divine Revelations for Allah's Messenger (ï·º) : So youshould search for (the Qur'an and collect) it." I started searching for the Qur'an till I found the last twoVerses of Surat at-Tauba with Abi Khuza`ima Al-Ansari and I could not find these Verses withanybody other than him. (They were):'Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves himthat you should receive any injury or difficulty ...' (9.128-129)

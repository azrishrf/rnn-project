74 | 30 | 63 | Narrated `Asim al-Ahwal: I saw the drinking bowl of the Prophet (ﷺ) with Anas bin Malik, and it had been broken, and he hadmended it with silver plates. That drinking bowl was quite wide and made of Nadar wood, Anas said,"I gave water to the Prophet (ﷺ) in that bowl more than so-and-so (for a long period)." Ibn Seereen said:Around that bowl there was an iron ring, and Anas wanted to replace it with a silver or gold ring, butAbu Talha said to him, "Do not change a thing that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has made." So Anas left it as itwas.

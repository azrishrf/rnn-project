96 | 2 | 10 | Narrated Abu Wail: I sat with Shaiba in this Mosque (Al-Masjid-Al-Haram), and he said, "`Umar once sat beside me hereas you are now sitting, and said, 'I feel like distributing all the gold and silver that are in it (i.e., theKa`ba) among the Muslims'. I said, 'You cannot do that.' `Umar said, 'Why?' I said, 'Your two(previous) companions (the Prophet (ï·º) and Abu Bakr) did not do it. `Umar said, 'They are the twopersons whom one must follow.'"

10 | 4 | 6 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "When the Adhan is pronounced Satan takes to his heels and passes wind withnoise during his flight in order not to hear the Adhan. When the Adhan is completed he comes backand again takes to his heels when the Iqama is pronounced and after its completion he returns againtill he whispers into the heart of the person (to divert his attention from his prayer) and makes himremember things which he does not recall to his mind before the prayer and that causes him to forgethow much he has prayed."

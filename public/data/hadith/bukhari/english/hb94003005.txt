94 | 3 | 5 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: We were in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we assumed the state of Ihram of Hajj and arrived atMecca on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered us to perform the Tawaf around the Ka`baand (Sa`i) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and use our lhram just for `Umra, and finish the state ofIhram unless we had our Hadi with us. None of us had the Hadi with him except the Prophet (ﷺ) andTalha. `Ali came from Yemen and brought the Hadi with him. `Ali said, 'I had assumed the state ofIhram with the same intention as that with which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had assumed it. The people said,"How can we proceed to Mina and our male organs are dribbling?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "If I hadformerly known what I came to know latterly, I would not have brought the Hadi, and had there beenno Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram." Suraqa (bin Malik) met the Prophet (ﷺ) while he wasthrowing pebbles at the Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba, and asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Is this (permitted) for usonly?" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied. "No, it is forever" `Aisha had arrived at Mecca while she wasmenstruating, therefore the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered her to perform all the ceremonies of Hajj except theTawaf around the Ka`ba, and not to perform her prayers unless and until she became clean . Whenthey encamped at Al-Batha, `Aisha said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You are proceeding after performingboth Hajj and `Umra while I am proceeding with Hajj only?" So the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered `Abdur-Rahmanbin Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to go with her to at-Tan`im, and so she performed the `Umra in Dhul-Hijjaafter the days of the Hajj.

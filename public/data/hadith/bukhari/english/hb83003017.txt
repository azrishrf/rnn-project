83 | 3 | 17 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "(The Prophet) Solomon once said, 'Tonight I will sleep with ninety women,each of whom will bring forth a (would-be) cavalier who will fight in Allah's Cause." On this, hiscompanion said to him, "Say: Allah willing!" But he did not say Allah willing. Solomon then sleptwith all the women, but none of them became pregnant but one woman who later delivered a halfman.By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad's soul is, if he (Solomon) had said, 'Allah willing' (all hiswives would have brought forth boys) and they would have fought in Allah's Cause as cavaliers.

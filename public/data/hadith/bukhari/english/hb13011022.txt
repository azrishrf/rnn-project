13 | 11 | 22 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "No good deeds done on other days are superior to those done on these (first tendays of Dhul Hijja)." Then some companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Not even Jihad?" He replied, "Noteven Jihad, except that of a man who does it by putting himself and his property in danger (for Allah'ssake) and does not return with any of those things."

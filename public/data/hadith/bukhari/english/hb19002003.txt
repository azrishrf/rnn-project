19 | 2 | 3 | Narrated Salim's father: In the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ) whosoever saw a dream would narrate it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). I had a wishof seeing a dream to narrate it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep inthe Mosque in the lifetime of the Prophet. I saw in the dream that two angels caught hold of me andtook me to the Fire which was built all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people init were known to me. I started saying, "I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire." Then I met anotherangel who told me not to be afraid.

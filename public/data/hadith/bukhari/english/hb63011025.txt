63 | 11 | 25 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Abu Bakr and Al-`Abbas passed by one of the gatherings of the Ansar who were weeping then. He(i.e. Abu Bakr or Al-`Abbas) asked, "Why are you weeping?" They replied, "We are weeping becausewe remember the gathering of the Prophet (ﷺ) with us." So Abu Bakr went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and told him ofthat. The Prophet (ﷺ) came out, tying his head with a piece of the hem of a sheet. He ascended the pulpitwhich he never ascended after that day. He glorified and praised Allah and then said, "I request you totake care of the Ansar as they are my near companions to whom I confided my private secrets. Theyhave fulfilled their obligations and rights which were enjoined on them but there remains what is forthem. So, accept the good of the good-doers amongst them and excuse the wrongdoers amongstthem."

76 | 27 | 37 | Narrated Sahl bin Saud As-Sa`idi: When the helmet broke on the head of the Prophet (ï·º) and his face became covered with blood and hisincisor tooth broke (i.e. during the battle of Uhud), `Ali used to bring water in his shield while Fatimawas washing the blood off his face. When Fatima saw that the bleeding increased because of thewater, she took a mat (of palm leaves), burnt it, and stuck it (the burnt ashes) on the wound of Allah'sApostle, whereupon the bleeding stopped.

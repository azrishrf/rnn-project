59 | 8 | 56 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "The first group (of people) who will enter Paradise will be (glittering) like themoon when it is full. They will not spit or blow their noses or relieve nature. Their utensils will be ofgold and their combs of gold and silver; in their centers the aloe wood will be used, and their sweatwill smell like musk. Everyone of them will have two wives; the marrow of the bones of the wives'legs will be seen through the flesh out of excessive beauty. They ( i.e. the people of Paradise) willneither have differences nor hatred amongst themselves; their hearts will be as if one heart and theywill be glorifying Allah in the morning and in the evening."

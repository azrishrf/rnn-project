96 | 23 | 77 | Narrated Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir: I saw Jabir bin `Abdullah swearing by Allah that Ibn Sayyad was the Dajjal. I said to Jabir, "How canyou swear by Allah?" Jabir said, "I have heard `Umar swearing by Allah regarding this matter in thepresence of the Prophet (ﷺ) and the Prophet (ﷺ) did not disapprove of it."

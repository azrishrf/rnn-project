4 | 37 | 50 | Narrated Asma' bint Abu Bakr: I came to `Aisha the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) during the solar eclipse. The people were standing andoffering the prayer and she was also praying. I asked her, "What is wrong with the people?" Shebeckoned with her hand towards the sky and said, "Subhan Allah." I asked her, "Is there a sign?" Shepointed out, "Yes." So I, too, stood for the prayer till I fell unconscious and later on I poured water onmy head. After the prayer, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) praised and glorified Allah and said, "Just now I have seensomething which I never saw before at this place of mine, including Paradise and Hell. I have beeninspired (and have understood) that you will be put to trials in your graves and these trials will be likethe trials of Ad-Dajjal, or nearly like it (the sub narrator is not sure of what Asma' said). Angels willcome to every one of you and ask, 'What do you know about this man?' A believer will reply, 'He isMuhammad, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , and he came to us with self-evident truth and guidance. So we acceptedhis teaching, believed and followed him.' Then the angels will say to him to sleep in peace as theyhave come to know that he was a believer. On the other hand a hypocrite or a doubtful person willreply, 'I do not know but heard the people saying something and so I said the same.' "

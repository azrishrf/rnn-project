59 | 8 | 58 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "The first batch (of people) who will enter Paradise will be (glittering) like the fullmoon, and the batch next to them will be (glittering) like the most brilliant star in the sky. Their heartswill be as if the heart of a single man, for they will have neither enmity nor jealousy amongstthemselves; everyone will have two wives from the houris, (who will be so beautiful, pure andtransparent that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the bones and the flesh."

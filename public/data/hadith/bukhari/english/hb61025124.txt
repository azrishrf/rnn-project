61 | 25 | 124 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) paid a visit to a sick bedouin. The Prophet (ﷺ) when visiting a patient used to say, "No harmwill befall you! May Allah cure you! May Allah cure you!" So the Prophet (ﷺ) said to the bedouin. "Noharm will befall you. May Allah cure you!" The bedouin said, "You say, may Allah cure me? No, forit is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the grave." The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Yes, then may it be as you say."

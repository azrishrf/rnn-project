Hefound Mu`adh praying so he made his camel kneel and joined Mu`adh in the prayer. The latter recitedSurat 'Al-Baqara" or Surat "An-Nisa", (so) the man left the prayer and went away. When he came toknow that Mu`adh had criticized him, he went to the Prophet, and complained against Mu`adh. TheProphet said thrice, "O Mu`adh ! Are you putting the people to trial?" It would have been better if youhad recited "Sabbih Isma Rabbika-l-A`la (87)", Wash-shamsi wa duhaha (91)", or "Wal-laili idhayaghsha (92)", for the old, the weak and the needy pray behind you." Jabir said that Mu`adh recitedSura Al-Baqara in the `Isha' prayer.

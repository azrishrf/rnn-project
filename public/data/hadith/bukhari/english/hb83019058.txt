83 | 19 | 58 | Narrated `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said a sentence and I said another. He said, "Whoever dies while he is setting up rivalsalong with Allah (i.e. worshipping others along with Allah) shall be admitted into the (Hell) Fire."And I said the other: "Whoever dies while he is not setting up rivals along with Allah (i.e.worshipping none except Allah) shall be admitted into Paradise."

Here is prosperity.'So, whoever was amongst the people who used to offer their prayers, will be called from the gate ofthe prayer; and whoever was amongst the people who used to participate in Jihad, will be called fromthe gate of Jihad; and whoever was amongst those who used to observe fasts, will be called from thegate of Ar-Raiyan; whoever was amongst those who used to give in charity, will be called from thegate of charity."

68 | 46 | 79 | Narrated Humaid bin Nafi`: Zainab bint Abu Salama told me these three narrations: Zainab said: I went to Um Habiba, the wife ofthe Prophet (ﷺ) when her father, Abu- Sufyan bin Herb had died. Um ,Habiba asked for a perfume whichcontained yellow scent (Khaluq) or some other scent, and she first perfumed one of the girls with itand then rubbed her cheeks with it and said, "By Allah, I am not in need of perfume, but I have heardAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn fora dead person for more than three days unless he is her husband for whom she should mourn for fourmonths and ten days.'"

67 | 64 | 98 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: "Whenever the Prophet (ﷺ) passed by (my mother Um-Sulaim) he used to enterher and greet her. Anas further said: Once the Prophet (ﷺ) way abridegroom during his marriage with Zainab, Um Sulaim said to me, "Letus give a gift to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ." I said to her, "Do it." So sheprepared Haisa (a sweet dish) made from dates, butter and driedyoghurt and she sent it with me to him. I took it to him and he said,"Put it down," and ordered me to call some men whom he named, and toinvite whomever I would meet. I did what he ordered me to do, and whenI returned, I found the house crowded with people and saw the Prophet (ﷺ)keeping his hand over the Haisa and saying over it whatever Allahwished (him to say). Then he called the men in batches of ten to eatof it, and he said to them, "Mention the Name of Allah, and each manshould eat of the dish the nearest to him." When all of them hadfinished their meals, some of them left and a few remained theretalking, over which I felt unhappy. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) went out towardsthe dwelling places (of his wives) and I too, went out after him andtold him that those people had left. Then he returned and entered hisdwelling place and let the curtains fall while I was in (his) dwellingplace, and he was reciting the Verses:-- 'O you who believe! Enter notthe Prophet's house until leave is given you for a meal, (and then)not (as early as) to what for its preparation. But when you areinvited, enter, and when you have taken your meals, disperse withoutsitting for a talk. Verily such (behavior) annoys the Prophet; and hewould be shy of (asking) you (to go), but Allah is not shy of (tellingyou) the Truth.' (33-53) Abu Uthman said: Anas said, "I served theProphet for ten years."

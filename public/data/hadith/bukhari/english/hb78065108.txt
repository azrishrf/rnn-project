78 | 65 | 108 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) visited a household among the Ansars, and he took a meal with them. When he intended to leave, he asked for a place in that house for him, to pray so a mat sprinkled with water was put and he offered prayer over it, and invoked for Allah's Blessing upon them (his hosts).

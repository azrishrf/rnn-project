78 | 68 | 116 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: While I was going along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who was wearing a Najrani Burd (sheet) with a thick border, a bedouin overtook the Prophet (ﷺ) and pulled his Rida' (sheet) forcibly. I looked at the side of the shoulder of the Prophet (ﷺ) and noticed that the edge of the Rida' had left a mark on it because of the violence of his pull. The bedouin said, "O Muhammad! Order for me some of Allah's property which you have." The Prophet (ﷺ) turned towards him, (smiled) and ordered that he be given something.

84 | 7 | 9 | Narrated `Amr: Jabir said: An Ansari man made his slave a Mudabbar and he had no other property than him. Whenthe Prophet (ï·º) heard of that, he said (to his companions), "Who wants to buy him (i.e., the slave) forme?" Nu'aim bin An-Nahham bought him for eight hundred Dirhams. I heard Jabir saying, "That wasa coptic slave who died in the same year."

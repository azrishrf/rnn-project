53 | 10 | 16 | Narrated Aisha: Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard the loud voices of some opponents quarreling at the door. One of themwas appealing to the other to deduct his debt and asking him to be lenient but the other was saying,"By Allah I will not do so." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out to them and said, "Who is the one who wasswearing by Allah that he would not do a favor?" That man said, "I am that person, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!I will give my opponent whatever he wishes."

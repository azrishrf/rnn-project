10 | 157 | 243 | Narrated Nafi: Ibn Umar used to offer prayers (Nawafil) at the place where he had offered the compulsory prayer. Al-Qasim (bin Muhammad bin Abi Bakr) did the same. The narration coming from Abu Hurairah (from the Prophet (ï·º)) forbidding the Imam from offering prayers (optional prayer) at the same place where he was offered the compulsory prayer is incorrect.

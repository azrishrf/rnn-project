81 | 14 | 33 | Narrated Abu Dhar: While I was walking with the Prophet (ﷺ) in the Harra of Medina, Uhud came in sight. The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"O Abu Dhar!" I said, "Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" He said, "I would not like to have gold equal tothis mountain of Uhud, unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar of it remains with me for morethan three days, except something which I will keep for repaying debts. I would have spent all of it(distributed it) amongst Allah's Slaves like this, and like this, and like this." The Prophet (ﷺ) pointed outwith his hand towards his right, his left and his back (while illustrating it). He proceeded with his walkand said, "The rich are in fact the poor (little rewarded) on the Day of Resurrection except those whospend their wealth like this, and like this, and like this, to their right, left and back, but such people arefew in number." Then he said to me, "Stay at your place and do not leave it till I come back." Then heproceeded in the darkness of the night till he went out of sight, and then I heard a loud voice, and wasafraid that something might have happened to the Prophet (ﷺ) .1 intended to go to him, but I rememberedwhat he had said to me, i.e. 'Don't leave your place till I come back to you,' so I remained at my placetill he came back to me. I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I heard a voice and I was afraid." So I mentionedthe whole story to him. He said, "Did you hear it?" I replied, "Yes." He said, "It was Gabriel whocame to me and said, 'Whoever died without joining others in worship with Allah, will enter Paradise.'I asked (Gabriel), 'Even if he had committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse? Gabrielsaid, 'Yes, even if he had committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse."

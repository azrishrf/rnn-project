33 | 9 | 12 | Narrated Abu Salama bin `Abdur-Rahman: I asked Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, "Did you hear Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) talking about the Night of Qadr?" Hereplied in the affirmative and said, "Once we were in I`tikaf with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the middle tendays of (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)delivereda sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said, 'I was informed (of the date) of the Night ofQadr (in my dream) but had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of themonth of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night ofQadr). So, whoever had been in I`tikaf with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) should return for it.' The people returnedto the mosque (for I`tikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud cameand it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet.

Abu Huraira is cleaning his nose with linen! Therecame a time when I would fall senseless between the pulpit of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and `Aisha's dwellingwhereupon a passerby would come and put his foot on my neck, considering me a mad man, but infact, I had no madness, I suffered nothing but hunger."

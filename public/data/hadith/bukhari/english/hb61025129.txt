61 | 25 | 129 | Narrated Jabir: (Once) the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Have you got carpets?" I replied, "Whence can we get carpets?" He said,"But you shall soon have carpets." I used to say to my wife, "Remove your carpets from my sight,"but she would say, "Didn't the Prophet (ﷺ) tell you that you would soon have carpets?" So I would give upmy request.

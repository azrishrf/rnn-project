Hudhaifa threw it away and said, "I have thrown it away because I told him not to use it, but hehas not stopped using it. The Prophet (ï·º) forbade us to wear clothes of silk or Dibaj, and to drink in goldor silver utensils, and said, 'These things are for them (unbelievers) in this world and for you(Muslims) in the Hereafter.'

96 | 27 | 90 | Narrated Ata: I heard Jabir bin `Abdullah in a gathering saying, "We, the companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) assumedthe state of Ihram to perform only Hajj without `Umra." Jabir added, "The Prophet (ﷺ) arrived (at Mecca)on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. And when we arrived (in Mecca) the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered us to finish the stateof Ihram, saying, "Finish your lhram and go to your wives (for sexual relation)." Jabir added, "TheProphet did not oblige us (to go to our wives) but he only made that legal for us. Then he heard thatwe were saying, "When there remains only five days between us and the Day of `Arafat he orders usto finish our Ihram by sleeping with our wives in which case we will proceed to `Arafat with our maleorgans dribbling with semen?' (Jabir pointed out with his hand illustrating what he was saying).Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up and said, 'You (People) know that I am the most Allah-fearing, the mosttruthful and the best doer of good deeds (pious) from among you. If I had not brought the Hadi withme, I would have finished my Ihram as you will do, so finish your Ihram. If I had formerly knownwhat I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me.' So we finished our Ihramand listened to the Prophet (ﷺ) and obeyed him."

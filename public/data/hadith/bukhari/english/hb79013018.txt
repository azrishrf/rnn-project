79 | 13 | 18 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: While I was present in one of the gatherings of the Ansar, Abu Musa came as if he was scared, andsaid, "I asked permission to enter upon `Umar three times, but I was not given the permission, so Ireturned." (When `Umar came to know about it) he said to Abu Musa, "Why did you not enter?'. AbuMusa replied, "I asked permission three times, and I was not given it, so I returned, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)said, "If anyone of you asks the permission to enter thrice, and the permission is not given, then heshould return.' " `Umar said, "By Allah! We will ask Abu Musa to bring witnesses for it." (Abu Musawent to a gathering of the Ansar and said). "Did anyone of you hear this from the Prophet (ﷺ) ?" Ubai binKa`b said, "By Allah, none will go with you but the youngest of the people (as a witness)." (AbuSa`id) was the youngest of them, so I went with Abu Musa and informed `Umar that the Prophet (ﷺ) hadsaid so.

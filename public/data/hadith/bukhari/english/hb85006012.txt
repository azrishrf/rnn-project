85 | 6 | 12 | Narrated Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas: I was stricken by an ailment that led me to the verge of death. The Prophet (ﷺ) came to pay me a visit. Isaid, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have much property and no heir except my single daughter. Shall I givetwo-thirds of my property in charity?" He said, "No." I said, "Half of it?" He said, "No." I said, "Onethirdof it?" He said, "You may do so) though one-third is also to a much, for it is better for you toleave your off-spring wealthy than to leave them poor, asking others for help. And whatever youspend (for Allah's sake) you will be rewarded for it, even for a morsel of food which you may put inthe mouth of your wife." I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Will I remain behind and fail to complete myemigration?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "If you are left behind after me, whatever good deeds you will do forAllah's sake, that will upgrade you and raise you high. May be you will have long life so that somepeople may benefit by you and others (the enemies) be harmed by you." But Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) felt sorryfor Sa`d bin Khaula as he died in Mecca. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that Sa`d bin Khaula was a manfrom the tribe of Bani 'Amir bin Lu'ai.)

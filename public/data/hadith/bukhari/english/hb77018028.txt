Sahl added, "The lady said, 'OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have knitted this (Burda) with my own hands for you to wear it." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)took it and he was in need of it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came out to us and he was wearing it as an Izar. Aman from the people felt it and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Give it to me to wear.' The Prophet (ﷺ) s said,'Yes.' Then he sat there for some time (and when he went to his house), he folded it and sent it to him.The people said to that man, 'You have not done a right thing. You asked him for it, though you knowthat he does not put down anybody's request.' The man said, 'By Allah! I have only asked him so thatit may be my shroud when I die." Sahl added, "Late it was his shroud."

Then he performed aprolonged bowing which was shorter than the first and then lifted his head and performed twoprostrations. He then stood up for the second rak`a and offered it like the first. Then he stood up andsaid, "The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone's life or death but they are two signsamongst the signs of Allah which He shows to His worshipers. So whenever you see them, make hastefor the prayer."

This is the son of my brother`Utba who authorized me to take him into my custody." 'Abu bin Zam`a said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Heis my brother, the son of Zam`a's slave-girl and he was born on his bed." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked at theson of the slave-girl of Zam`a and noticed much resemblance (to `Utba).

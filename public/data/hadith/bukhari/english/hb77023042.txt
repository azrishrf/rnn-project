77 | 23 | 42 | Narrated `Ikrima: Rifa`a divorced his wife whereupon `AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. `Aisha saidthat the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showedher a green spot on her skin caused by beating). It was the habit of ladies to support each other, sowhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, `Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as thebelieving women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!" When `AbdurRahman heard that hiswife had gone to the Prophet, he came with his two sons from another wife. She said, "By Allah! Ihave done no wrong to him but he is impotent and is as useless to me as this," holding and showingthe fringe of her garment, `Abdur-Rahman said, "By Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! She has told a lie! I amvery strong and can satisfy her but she is disobedient and wants to go back to Rifa`a." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)said, to her, "If that is your intention, then know that it is unlawful for you to remarry Rifa`a unless`Abdur-Rahman has had sexual intercourse with you." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) saw two boys with `Abdur-Rahman and asked (him), "Are these your sons?" On that `AbdurRahman said, "Yes." The Prophet (ﷺ)said, "You claim what you claim (i.e.. that he is impotent)? But by Allah, these boys resemble him asa crow resembles a crow,"

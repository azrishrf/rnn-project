21 | 11 | 14 | Narrated `Aisha: Once the sun eclipsed and Allah's Messenger (ï·º) stood up for the prayer and recited a very long Sura andwhen bowed for a long while and then raised his head and started reciting another Sura. Then hebowed, and after finishing, he prostrated and did the same in the second rak`a and then said, "These(lunar and solar eclipses) are two of the signs of Allah and if you see them, pray till the eclipse is over.No doubt, while standing at this place I saw everything promised to me by Allah and I saw (Paradise)and I wanted to pluck a bunch (of grapes) therefrom, at the time when you saw me stepping forward.No doubt, I saw Hell with its different parts destroying each other when you saw me retreating and init I saw `Amr bin Luhai who started the tradition of freeing animals (set them free) in the name ofidols."

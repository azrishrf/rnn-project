90 | 15 | 28 | Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) appointed a man called Ibn Al-Lutabiyya to collect the Zakat from Bani Sulaim'stribe. When he returned, the Prophet (ﷺ) called him to account. He said (to the Prophet, 'This is yourmoney, and this has been given to me as a gift." On that, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Why didn't you stay inyour father's and mother's house to see whether you will be given gifts or not if you are telling thetruth?" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) addressed us, and after praising and glorifying Allah, he said: "AmmaBa'du", I employ a man from among you to manage some affair of what Allah has put under mycustody, and then he comes to me and says, 'This is your money and this has been given to me as agift. Why didn't he stay in his father's and mother's home to see whether he will be given gifts or not?By Allah, not anyone of you takes a thing unlawfully but he will meet Allah on the Day ofResurrection, carrying that thing. I do not want to see any of you carrying a grunting camel or amooing cow or a bleating sheep on meeting Allah." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) raised both his hands till thewhiteness of his armpits became visible, and he said, "O Allah! Haven't I have conveyed (YourMessage)?" The narrator added: My eyes witnessed and my ears heard (that Hadith).

67 | 109 | 163 | Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) who was on the pulpit, saying, "Banu Hisham bin Al-Mughira have requestedme to allow them to marry their daughter to `Ali bin Abu Talib, but I don't give permission, and willnot give permission unless `Ali bin Abi Talib divorces my daughter in order to marry their daughter,because Fatima is a part of my body, and I hate what she hates to see, and what hurts her, hurts me."

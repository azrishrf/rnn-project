While he was in his death-bed, he called his sons and said, 'What type of father have Ibeen to you? They replied, 'You have been a good father.' He said, 'I have never done a single gooddeed; so when I die, burn me, crush my body, and scatter the resulting ashes on a windy day.' His sonsdid accordingly, but Allah gathered his particles and asked (him), 'What made you do so?' He replied,"Fear of you.' So Allah bestowed His Mercy upon him. (forgave him).

28 | 4 | 3 | Narrated Abu Qatada: We were in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) at a place called Al-Qaha (which is at a distance of threestages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada narrated through another group of narrators: We were inthe company of the Prophet (ﷺ) at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram while theothers had not. I noticed that some of my companions were watching something, so I looked up andsaw an onager. (I rode my horse and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I askedthem to pick it up for me) but they said, "We will not help you by any means as we are in a state ofIhram." So, I picked up the whip myself and attacked the onager from behind a hillock andslaughtered it and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, "Eat it." While some others said,"Do not eat it." So, I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) who was ahead of us and asked him about it, He replied, "Eatit as it is Halal (i.e. it is legal to eat it).

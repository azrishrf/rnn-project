On the day when it was her turn to be with the Prophet,she said, "Do you know, O Allah's Messenger (ï·º), that I have manumitted my slave-girl?" He said, "Haveyou really?" She replied in the affirmative. He said, "You would have got more reward if you hadgiven her (i.e. the slave-girl) to one of your maternal uncles."

61 | 28 | 144 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ï·º)! I hear many narrations from you but I forget them." He said, "Spread your covering sheet." I spread my sheet and he moved both his hands as if scooping something and emptied them in the sheet and said, "Wrap it." I wrapped it round my body, and since then I have never forgotten.

3 | 46 | 66 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Ammar: I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) near the Jamra and the people were asking him questions (about religiousproblems). A man asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have slaughtered the Hadi (animal) before doing theRami." The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "Do the Rami (now) and there is no harm." Another person asked, "OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I got my head shaved before slaughtering the animal." The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "Do theslaughtering (now) and there is no harm." So on that day, when the Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about anythingas regards the ceremonies of Hajj performed before or after its due time his reply was, "Do it (now)and there is no harm."

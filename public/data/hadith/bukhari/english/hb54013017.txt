54 | 13 | 17 | Narrated `Urwa: Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and said, 'My people (masters) have written the contract for myemancipation for nine Awaq ) of gold) to be paid in yearly installments, one Uqiyya per year; so helpme." Aisha said (to her), "If your masters agree, I will pay them the whole sum provided the Wala willbe for me." Buraira went to her masters and told them about it, but they refused the offer and shereturned from them while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s was sitting. She said, "I presented the offer to them, butthey refused unless the Wala' would be for them." When the Prophet (ﷺ) heard that and `Aisha told himabout It, he said to her, "Buy Buraira and let them stipulate that her Wala' will be for them, as theWala' is for the manumitted." `Aisha did so. After that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up amidst the people,Glorified and Praised Allah and said, "What is wrong with some people who stipulate things whichare not in Allah's Laws? Any condition which is not in Allah's Laws is invalid even if there were ahundred such conditions. Allah's Rules are the most valid and Allah's Conditions are the most solid.The Wala is for the manumitted."

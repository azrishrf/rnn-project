58 | 10 | 17 | Narrated Ibrahim at-Tamimi's father: `Ali delivered a sermon saying, "We have no book to read except the Book of Allah and what iswritten in this paper which contains verdicts regarding (retaliation for) wounds, the ages of the camels(given as Zakat or as blood money) and the fact that Medina is a sanctuary in between Air mountain toso-and-so (mountain). So, whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin or gives shelter in it, tosuch an innovator will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all the people, and none of hiscompulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And whoever (freed slave) takes ashis master (i.e. befriends) other than his real masters will incur the same (Curse). And the asylumgranted by any Muslim is to be secured by all the other Muslims, and whoever betrays a Muslim inthis respect will incur the same (Curse).

I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! My sickness hasreduced me to the (bad) state as you see, and I am a rich man, but have no heirs except one daughter.Shall I give 2/3 of my property in charity?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'Then 1/2 of it?' He said, 'Even 1/3 istoo much, for, to leave your inheritors wealthy is better than to leave them in poverty, begging frompeople. And (know that) whatever you spend in Allah's Cause, you will get reward for it, even for themorsel of food which you put in your wife's mouth.' I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Will I be left behindmy companions (in Mecca)?' He said, 'If you remain behind, whatever good deed you will do forAllah's Sake, will raise and upgrade you to a higher position (in Allah's Sight). May be you will livelonger so that some people may benefit by you, and some e others (pagans) may get harmed by you. OAllah! Complete the migration of my companions and do not turn them on their heels; But (we pity)the poor Sa`d bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sa`d) (died in Mecca)" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) lamented(or pitied) for him as he died in Mecca.

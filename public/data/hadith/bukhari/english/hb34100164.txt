34 | 100 | 164 | Narrated `Aisha: Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas and 'Abu bin Zam`a quarreled over a boy. Sa`d said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Thisboy is the son of my brother (`Utba bin Abi Waqqas) who took a promise from me that I would takehim as he was his (illegal) son. Look at him and see whom he resembles." 'Abu bin Zam`a said, "OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This is my brother and was born on my father's bed from his slave-girl." Allah'sApostle cast a look at the boy and found definite resemblance to `Utba and then said, "The boy is foryou, O 'Abu bin Zam`a. The child goes to the owner of the bed and the adulterer gets nothing but thestones (despair, i.e. to be stoned to death). Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Sauda bint Zama! Screenyourself from this boy." So, Sauda never saw him again.

34 | 3 | 7 | Narrated `Adi bin Hatim: I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about Al Mirad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece of wood providedwith a piece of iron used for hunting). He replied, "If the game is hit by its sharp edge, eat it, and if itis hit by its broad side, do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death." I asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Irelease my dog by the name of Allah and find with it at the game, another dog on which I have notmentioned the name of Allah, and I do not know which one of them caught the game." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)said (to him), 'Don't eat it as you have mentioned the name of Allah on your dog and not on the otherdog."

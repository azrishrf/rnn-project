10 | 166 | 268 | Narrated Umm Salama: Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) completed the Salat with Taslim, the women used to get up immediately and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)would remain at his place for sometime before getting up. The subnarrator (Az-Zuhri) said, "We think, and Allah knows better, that he did so, so that the women might leave before the men could catch up with them."

45 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Ubai bin Ka`b: I found a purse containing one hundred Diners. So I went to the Prophet (and informed him about it),he said, "Make public announcement about it for one year" I did so, but nobody turned up to claim it,so I again went to the Prophet (ï·º) who said, "Make public announcement for another year." I did, butnone turned up to claim it. I went to him for the third time and he said, "Keep the container and thestring which is used for its tying and count the money it contains and if its owner comes, give it tohim; otherwise, utilize it."The sub-narrator Salama said, "I met him (Suwaid, another sub-narrator) in Mecca and he said, 'I don'tknow whether Ubai made the announcement for three years or just one year.'

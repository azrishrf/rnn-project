The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and addressed them, "O Assemblyof Jews! Embrace Islam and you will be safe!" The Jews replied, "O Aba-l-Qasim! You haveconveyed Allah's message to us." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "That is what I want (from you)." He repeated hisfirst statement for the second time, and they said, "You have conveyed Allah's message, O Aba-l-Qasim." Then he said it for the third time and added, "You should Know that the earth belongs toAllah and His Apostle, and I want to exile you fro,,, this land, so whoever among you owns someproperty, can sell it, otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle."

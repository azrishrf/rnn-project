34 | 73 | 120 | Narrated `Urwa: Aisha said, "Barira came to me and said, 'I have agreed with my masters to pay them nine Uqiyas (ofgold) (in installments) one Uqiya per year; please help me.' I said, 'I am ready to pay the wholeamount now provided your masters agree that your Wala' will be for me.' So, Barira went to hermasters and told them about that offer but they refused to accept it. She returned, and at that time,Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was sitting (present). Barira said, 'I told them of the offer but they did not accept itand insisted on having the Wala'.' The Prophet (ﷺ) heard that." `Aisha narrated the whole story to theProphet. He said to her, "Buy her and stipulate that her Wala' would be yours as the Wala' is for themanumitter." `Aisha did so. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up in front of the people, and after glorifyingAllah he said, "Amma Ba`du (i.e. then after)! What about the people who impose conditions which arenot in Allah's Book (Laws)? Any condition that is not in Allah's Book (Laws) is invalid even if theywere one hundred conditions, for Allah's decisions are the right ones and His conditions are the strongones (firmer) and the Wala' will be for the manumitter."

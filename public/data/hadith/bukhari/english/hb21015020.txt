21 | 15 | 20 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent me for some job and when I had finished it I returned and came to the Prophet (ﷺ)and greeted him but he did not return my greeting. So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and Isaid to myself,, 'Perhaps Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is angry because I did not come quickly, then again I greetedhim but he did not reply. I felt even more sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and hereturned the greeting and said, "The thing which prevented me from returning the greeting was that Iwas praying." And at that time he was on his Rahila and his face was not towards the Qibla.

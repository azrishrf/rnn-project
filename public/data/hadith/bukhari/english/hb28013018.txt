What clothes may be worn in the state of Ihram?"The Prophet (ï·º) replied, "Do not wear a shirt or trousers, or any headgear (e.g. a turban), or a hoodedcloak; but if somebody has no shoes he can wear leather stockings provided they are cut short off theankles, and also, do not wear anything perfumed with Wars or saffron, and the Muhrima (a woman inthe state of Ihram) should not cover her face, or wear gloves."

78 | 106 | 213 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: A man among us begot a boy whom he named Al-Qasim. The people said (to him), "We will not call you Abul-l-Qasim, nor will we please you by calling you so." The man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, "Name your son `Abdur-Rahman."

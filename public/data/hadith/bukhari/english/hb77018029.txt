77 | 18 | 29 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying "From among my followers, a group (o 70,000) will enter Paradisewithout being asked for their accounts, Their faces will be shining like the moon." 'Ukasha binMuhsin Al-Asadi got up, lifting his covering sheet and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Invoke Allah for methat He may include me with them." The Prophet (ﷺ) said! "O Allah! Make him from them." Then anotherman from Al-Ansar got up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Invoke Allah for me that He may include mewith them." On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "'Ukasha has anticipated you."

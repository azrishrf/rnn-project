He stood for a long periodand then performed a long bowing and then stood straight for a long period which was shorter thanthat of the first standing, then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the firstbowing, then he raised his head and prostrated for a long time and then stood up (for the second rak`a)for a long while, but the standing was shorter than the standing of the first rak`a. Then he performed aprolonged bowing which was shorter than that of the first one. He then stood up for a long time butshorter than the first, then again performed a long bowing which was shorter than the first and thenprostrated for a shorter while than that of the first prostration.

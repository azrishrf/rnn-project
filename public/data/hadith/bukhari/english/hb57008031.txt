57 | 8 | 31 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A prophet amongst the prophets carried out a holy military expedition, so he saidto his followers, 'Anyone who has married a woman and wants to consummate the marriage, and hasnot done so yet, should not accompany me; nor should a man who has built a house but has notcompleted its roof; nor a man who has sheep or shecamels and is waiting for the birth of their youngones.' So, the prophet carried out the expedition and when he reached that town at the time or nearly atthe time of the `Asr prayer, he said to the sun, 'O sun! You are under Allah's Order and I am underAllah's Order O Allah! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.' It was stopped till Allah made himvictorious.Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it, but it did not burn it. He said (to his men),'Some of you have stolen something from the booty. So one man from every tribe should give me apledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck overthe hand of their prophet. Then that prophet said (to the man), 'The theft has been committed by yourpeople. So all the persons of your tribe should give me the pledge of allegiance by shaking hands withme.' The hands of two or three men got stuck over the hand of their prophet and he said, "You havecommitted the theft.' Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a cow and put it there, and thefire came and consumed the booty. The Prophet (ﷺ) added: Then Allah saw our weakness and disability,so he made booty legal for us."

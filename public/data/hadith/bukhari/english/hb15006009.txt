15 | 6 | 9 | Narrated Sharik bin `Abdullah bin Abi Namir: I heard Anas bin Malik saying, "On a Friday a person entered the main Mosque through the gatefacing the pulpit while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was delivering the Khutba. The man stood in front of Allah'sApostle and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off; so please prayto Allah for rain.' " Anas added, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) raised both his hands and said, 'O Allah!Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain!' " Anas added, "By Allah,we could not see any trace of cloud in the sky and there was no building or a house between us and(the mountains of) Sila." Anas added, "A heavy cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Sila'Mountain). When it came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained." Anas further said, "ByAllah! We could not see the sun for a week. Next Friday a person entered through the same gate andat that time Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was delivering the Friday's Khutba. The man stood in front of him andsaid, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off, please pray to Allah towithhold rain.' " Anas added, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I raised both his hands and said, 'O Allah! Round aboutus and not on us. O Allah! On the plateaus, on the mountains, on the hills, in the valleys and on theplaces where trees grow.' So the rain stopped and we came out walking in the sun." Sharik asked Anaswhether it was the same person who had asked for the rain (the last Friday). Anas replied that he didnot know.

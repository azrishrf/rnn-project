3 | 50 | 72 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: Once Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Amongst the trees there is a tree, the leaves of which do not fall and islike a Muslim, tell me the name of that tree." Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desertareas and I thought of the date-palm tree but felt shy (to answer). The others asked, "O Allah'sApostle! inform us of it." He replied, "it is the date-palm tree." I told my father what had come to mymind and on that he said, "Had you said it I would have preferred it to such and such a thing that Imight possess."

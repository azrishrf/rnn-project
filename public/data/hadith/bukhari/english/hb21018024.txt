21 | 18 | 24 | Narrated `Uqba bin Al-Harith: I offered the `Asr prayer with the Prophet (ï·º) and after finishing the prayer with Taslim he got up quicklyand went to some of his wives and then came out. He noticed the signs of astonishment on the faces ofthe people caused by his speed. He then said, "I remembered while I was in my prayer that a piece ofgold was Lying in my house and I disliked that it should remain with us throughout the night, and so Ihave ordered it to be distributed."

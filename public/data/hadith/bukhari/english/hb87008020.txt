87 | 8 | 20 | Narrated Abu Huraira: In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza`a killed a man from the tribe of Bam Laith inrevenge for a killed person belonging to them in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. So Allah'sApostle got up saying, "Allah held back the (army having) elephants from Mecca, but He let HisApostle and the believers overpower the infidels (of Mecca). Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary)! Verily!Fighting in Mecca was not permitted for anybody before me, nor will it be permitted for anybody afterme; It was permitted for me only for a while (an hour or so) of that day. No doubt! It is at this momenta sanctuary; its thorny shrubs should not be uprooted; its trees should not be cut down; and its Luqata(fallen things) should not be picked up except by the one who would look for its owner. And ifsomebody is killed, his closest relative has the right to choose one of two things, i.e., either the Bloodmoney or retaliation by having the killer killed." Then a man from Yemen, called Abu Shah, stood upand said, "Write that) for me, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to his companions), "Writethat for Abu Shah." Then another man from Quraish got up, saying, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Except Al-Idhkhir (a special kind of grass) as we use it in our houses and for graves." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said,"Except Al-idhkkir."

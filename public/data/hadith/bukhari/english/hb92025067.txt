92 | 25 | 67 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The Hour will not be established (1) till two big groups fight each otherwhereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one andthe same religious doctrine, (2) till about thirty Dajjals (liars) appear, and each one of them will claimthat he is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), (3) till the religious knowledge is taken away (by the death of Religiousscholars) (4) earthquakes will increase in number (5) time will pass quickly, (6) afflictions willappear, (7) Al-Harj, (i.e., killing) will increase, (8) till wealth will be in abundance ---- so abundantthat a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his Zakat, and whenever he will present itto someone, that person (to whom it will be offered) will say, 'I am not in need of it, (9) till the peoplecompete with one another in constructing high buildings, (10) till a man when passing by a grave ofsomeone will say, 'Would that I were in his place (11) and till the sun rises from the West. So whenthe sun will rise and the people will see it (rising from the West) they will all believe (embrace Islam)but that will be the time when: (As Allah said,) 'No good will it do to a soul to believe then, if itbelieved not before, nor earned good (by deeds of righteousness) through its Faith.' (6.158) And theHour will be established while two men spreading a garment in front of them but they will not be ableto sell it, nor fold it up; and the Hour will be established when a man has milked his she-camel and hastaken away the milk but he will not be able to drink it; and the Hour will be established before a manrepairing a tank (for his livestock) is able to water (his animals) in it; and the Hour will be establishedwhen a person has raised a morsel (of food) to his mouth but will not be able to eat it."

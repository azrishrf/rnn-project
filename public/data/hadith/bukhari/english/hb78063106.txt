78 | 63 | 106 | Narrated `Aisha: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, " I know whether you are angry or pleased." I said, "How do you know that, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" He said, "When you are pleased, you say, "Yes, by the Lord of Muhammad,' but when you are angry, you say, 'No, by the Lord of Abraham!' " I said, "Yes, I do not leave, except your name."

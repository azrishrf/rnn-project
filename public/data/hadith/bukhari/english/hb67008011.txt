67 | 8 | 11 | Narrated 'Abdullah: We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Messenger (ï·º) andwe had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, "Shall we get ourselvescastrated?" He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women witha temporary contract (2) and recited to us: -- 'O you who believe !Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you,but commit no transgression.'

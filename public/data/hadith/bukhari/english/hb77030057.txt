77 | 30 | 57 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: `Umar saw a silk suit being sold, so he said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why don't you buy it so that you maywear it when delegates come to you, and also on Fridays?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "This is worn only byhim who has no share in the Hereafter." Afterwards the Prophet (ﷺ) sent to `Umar a silk suit suitable forwearing. `Umar said to the Prophet, "You have given it to me to wear, yet I have heard you sayingabout it what you said?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I sent it to you so that you might either sell it or give it tosomebody else to wear."

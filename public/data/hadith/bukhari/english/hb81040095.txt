81 | 40 | 95 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "The Hour will not be established till the sun rises from the west, and when itrises (from the west) and the people see it, then all of them will believe (in Allah). But that will be thetime when 'No good it will do to a soul to believe then. If it believed not before.."' (6.158)The Hour will be established (so suddenly) that two persons spreading a garment between them willnot be able to finish their bargain, nor will they be able to fold it up. The Hour will be establishedwhile a man is carrying the milk of his she-camel, but cannot drink it; and the Hour will be establishedwhen someone is not able to prepare the tank to water his livestock from it; and the Hour will beestablished when some of you has raised his food to his mouth but cannot eat it."

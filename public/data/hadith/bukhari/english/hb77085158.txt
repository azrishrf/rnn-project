77 | 85 | 158 | Narrated Ibn Mas`ud: Allah has cursed those women who practise tattooing or get it done for themselves, and those whoremove hair from their faces, and those who create spaces between their teeth artificially to lookbeautiful, such ladies as change the features created by Allah. Why then shall I not curse those whomAllah's Messenger (ï·º) has cursed and who are cursed in Allah's Book too?

77 | 32 | 62 | Narrated Um Khalid bint Khalid: Some clothes were presented to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) as a gift and there was a black Khamisa with it. TheProphet asked (his companions), "To whom do you suggest we give this Khamisa?" The people keptquiet. Then he said, "Bring me Um Khalid," So I was brought to him and he dressed me with it withhis own hands and said twice, "May you live so long that you will wear out many garments." He thenstarted looking at the embroidery of that Khamisa and said, "O Um Khalid! This is Sana!" (Sana inEthiopian language means beautiful.) 'Is-haq, a sub-narrator, said: A woman of my family had told methat she had seen the Khamisa worn by Um Khalid.

70 | 23 | 44 | Narrated Sa`d: I was one of (the first) seven (who had embraced Islam) with Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and we had nothing toeat then, except the leaves of the Habala or Hubula tree, so that our stool used to be similar to that ofsheep. Now the tribe of Bani Asad wants to teach me Islam; I would be a loser and all my effortswould be in vain (if I learn Islam anew from them).

28 | 14 | 20 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Hunain: `Abdullah bin Al-Abbas and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama differed at Al-Abwa'; Ibn `Abbas said that aMuhrim could wash his head; while Al-Miswar maintained that he should not do so. `Abdullah bin`Abbas sent me to Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari and I found him bathing between the two wooden posts (ofthe well) and was screened with a sheet of cloth. I greeted him and he asked who I was. I replied, "Iam `Abdullah bin Hunain and I have been sent to you by Ibn `Abbas to ask you how Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)used to wash his head while in the state of lhram." Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari caught hold of the sheet ofcloth and lowered it till his head appeared before me, and then told somebody to pour water on hishead. He poured water on his head, and he (Abu Aiyub) rubbed his head with his hands by bringingthem from back to front and from front to back and said, "I saw the Prophet (ﷺ) doing like this."

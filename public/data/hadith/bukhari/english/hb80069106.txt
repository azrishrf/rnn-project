80 | 69 | 106 | Narrated Shaqiq: While we were waiting for `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud). Yazid bin Muawiya came. I said (to him), "Willyou sit down?" He said, "No, but I will go into the house (of Ibn Mas`ud) and let your companion (IbnMas`ud) come out to you; and if he should not (come out), I will come out and sit (with you)." Then`Abdullah came out, holding the hand of Yazid, addressed us, saying, "I know that you are assembledhere, but the reason that prevents me from coming out to you, is that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) used to preach tous at intervals during the days, lest we should become bored."

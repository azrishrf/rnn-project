I have lost my eyesight and I lead my people in the prayer (as an Imam). When it rains, thevalley which is between me and my people, flows with water, and then I cannot go to their mosque tolead them in the prayer. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I wish that you could come and pray in my house so that Imay take it as a praying place. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Allah willing, I will do that." The next morning,soon after the sun had risen, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came with Abu Bakr. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked for thepermission to enter and I admitted him. The Prophet (ﷺ) had not sat till he had entered the house and saidto me, "Where do you like me to pray in your house?" I pointed at a place in my house whereupon hestood and said, "Allahu Akbar." We lined behind him and he prayed two rak`at and finished it withTaslim. We then requested him to stay for a special meal of Khazira which we had prepared. A largenumber of men from the adjoining area gathered in the house. One of them said, "Where is Malik binAd-Dukhshun?" Another man said, "He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle." TheProphet said, "Do not say so. Do you not think that he has said: "None has the right to be worshippedbut Allah," seeking Allah's pleasure? The man said, "Allah and His Apostle know better, but we havealways seen him mixing with hypocrites and giving them advice." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Allah hasforbidden the (Hell) Fire for those who testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah,seeking Allah's pleasure. "

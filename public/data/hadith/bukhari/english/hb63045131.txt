63 | 45 | 131 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sat on the pulpit and said, "Allah has given one of His Slaves the choice of receivingthe splendor and luxury of the worldly life whatever he likes or to accept the good (of the Hereafter)which is with Allah. So he has chosen that good which is with Allah." On that Abu Bakr wept andsaid, "Our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you." We became astonished at this. The people said,"Look at this old man! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) talks about a Slave of Allah to whom He has given the optionto choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with Him, while he says. 'ourfathers and mothers be sacrifice(i for you." But it was Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who had been given option,and Abu Bakr knew it better than we. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) added, "No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakrmore than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take aKhalil from my followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is.sufficient. Let no door (i.e. Khoukha) of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu Bakr."

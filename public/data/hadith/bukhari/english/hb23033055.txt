23 | 33 | 55 | Narrated Al-Mughira: I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, "Ascribing false things to me is not like ascribing false things to anyoneelse. Whosoever tells a lie against me intentionally then surely let him occupy his seat in Hell-Fire." Iheard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, "The deceased who is wailed over is tortured for that wailing."

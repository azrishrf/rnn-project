19 | 12 | 23 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Satan puts three knots at the back of the head of any of you if he is asleep. Onevery knot he reads and exhales the following words, 'The night is long, so stay asleep.' When onewakes up and remembers Allah, one knot is undone; and when one performs ablution, the second knotis undone, and when one prays the third knot is undone and one gets up energetic with a good heart inthe morning; otherwise one gets up lazy and with a mischievous heart."

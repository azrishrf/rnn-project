77 | 8 | 14 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: The Prophet (ﷺ) came to visit `Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) after he had been put in his grave. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that `Abdullah be taken out. He was taken out and was placed on the knees of the Prophet, who blew his (blessed) breath on him and dressed the body with his own shirt. And Allah knows better.

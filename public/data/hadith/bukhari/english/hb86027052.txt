I have committed a legallypunishable sin; please inflict the legal punishment on me'.' The Prophet (ﷺ) did not ask him what he haddone. Then the time for the prayer became due and the man offered prayer along with the Prophet (ﷺ) ,and when the Prophet (ﷺ) had finished his prayer, the man again got up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!

87 | 22 | 39 | Narrated Sahl bin Abi Hathma: (a man from the Ansar) that a number of people from his tribe went to Khaibar and dispersed, andthen they found one of them murdered. They said to the people with whom the corpse had been found,"You have killed our companion!" Those people said, "Neither have we killed him, nor do we knowhis killer." The bereaved group went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We went to Khaibarand found one of us murdered." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Let the older among you come forward andspeak." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, to them, "Bring your proof against the killer." They said "We have noproof." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Then they (the defendants) will take an oath." They said, "We do not acceptthe oaths of the Jews." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not like that the Blood-money of the killed one be lostwithout compensation, so he paid one-hundred camels out of the camels of Zakat (to the relatives ofthe deceased) as Diya (Blood-money).

61 | 24 | 79 | Narrated Sharik bin `Abdullah bin Abi Namr: I heard Anas bin Malik telling us about the night when the Prophet (ﷺ) was made to travel from the Ka`baMosque. Three persons (i.e. angels) came to the Prophet (ﷺ) before he was divinely inspired was anAspostle), while he was sleeping in Al Masjid-ul-Haram. The first (of the three angels) said, "Whichof them is he?" The second said, "He is the best of them." That was all that happened then, and he didnot see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with his heart, for the eyesof the Prophet (ﷺ) were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was not asleep (not unconscious). This ischaracteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel tookcharge of the Prophet (ﷺ) and ascended along with him to the Heaven.

23 | 77 | 116 | Narrated Jabir: When the time of the Battle of Uhud approached, my father called me at night and said, "I think that Iwill be the first amongst the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) to be martyred. I do not leave anyone after medearer to me than you, except Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)'s soul and I owe some debt and you should repay it andtreat your sisters favorably (nicely and politely)." So in the morning he was the first to be martyredand was buried along with another (martyr). I did not like to leave him with the other (martyr) so Itook him out of the grave after six months of his burial and he was in the same condition as he was onthe day of burial, except a slight change near his ear.

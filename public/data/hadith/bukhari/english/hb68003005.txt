68 | 3 | 5 | Narrated Abu Usaid: We went out with the Prophet (ﷺ) to a garden called Ash-Shaut till we reached two walls between whichwe sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Sit here," and went in (the garden). The Jauniyya (a lady from BaniJaun) had been brought and lodged in a house in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima bint An-Nu`man bin Sharahil, and her wet nurse was with her. When the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon her, he said toher, "Give me yourself (in marriage) as a gift." She said, "Can a princess give herself in marriage to anordinary man?" The Prophet (ﷺ) raised his hand to pat her so that she might become tranquil. She said, "Iseek refuge with Allah from you." He said, "You have sought refuge with One Who gives refuge.Then the Prophet (ﷺ) came out to us and said, "O Abu Usaid! Give her two white linen dresses to wearand let her go back to her family."

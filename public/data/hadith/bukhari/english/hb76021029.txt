76 | 21 | 29 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas and `Aisha: Abu Bakr kissed (the forehead of) the Prophet (ï·º) when he was dead. `Aisha added: We put medicine inone side of his mouth but he started waving us not to insert the medicine into his mouth. We said, "Hedislikes the medicine as a patient usually does." But when he came to his senses he said, "Did I notforbid you to put medicine (by force) in the side of my mouth?" We said, "We thought it was justbecause a patient usually dislikes medicine." He said, "None of those who are in the house but will beforced to take medicine in the side of his mouth while I am watching, except Al-`Abbas, for he hadnot witnessed your deed."

She has given herself in marriage to you; please give your opinion of her." TheProphet did not give her any reply. She again stood up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! She has givenherself (in marriage) to you; so please give your opinion of her. The Prophet (ﷺ) did not give her anyreply. She again stood up for the third time and said, "She has given herself in marriage to you: sogive your opinion of her." So a man stood up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Marry her to me." TheProphet asked him, "Have you got anything?" He said, "No." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Go and search forsomething, even if it were an iron ring." The man went and searched and then returned saying, "Icould not find anything, not even an iron ring." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do you know something ofthe Qur'an (by heart)?" He replied, "I know (by heart) such Sura and such Sura." The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Go! I have married her to you for what you know of the Qur'an (by heart).

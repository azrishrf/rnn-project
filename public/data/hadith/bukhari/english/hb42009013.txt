42 | 9 | 13 | Narrated Asma' bint Abi Bakr: The Prophet (ï·º) prayed the eclipse prayer, and then said, "Hell was displayed so close that I said, 'O myLord ! Am I going to be one of its inhabitants?"' Suddenly he saw a woman. I think he said, who wasbeing scratched by a cat. He said, "What is wrong with her?" He was told, "She had imprisoned it (i.e.the cat) till it died of hunger."

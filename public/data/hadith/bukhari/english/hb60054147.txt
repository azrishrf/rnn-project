60 | 54 | 147 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Amongst the men of Bani Israel there was a man who had murdered ninety-ninepersons. Then he set out asking (whether his repentance could be accepted or not). He came upon amonk and asked him if his repentance could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative and so theman killed him. He kept on asking till a man advised to go to such and such village. (So he left for it)but death overtook him on the way. While dying, he turned his chest towards that village (where hehad hoped his repentance would be accepted), and so the angels of mercy and the angels ofpunishment quarrelled amongst themselves regarding him. Allah ordered the village (towards whichhe was going) to come closer to him, and ordered the village (whence he had come), to go far away,and then He ordered the angels to measure the distances between his body and the two villages. So hewas found to be one span closer to the village (he was going to). So he was forgiven."

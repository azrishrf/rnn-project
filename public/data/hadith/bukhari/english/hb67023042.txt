67 | 23 | 42 | Narrated `Uqba bin Al-Harith: I married a woman and then a black lady came to us and said, "I have suckled you both (you and yourwife)." So I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "I married so-and-so and then a black lady came to us andsaid to me, 'I have suckled both of you.' But I think she is a liar." The Prophet (ﷺ) turned his face awayfrom me and I moved to face his face, and said, "She is a liar." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "How (can you keepher as your wife) when that lady has said that she has suckled both of you? So abandon (i.e., divorce)her (your wife).

64 | 83 | 471 | Narrated Al-Aswad: It was mentioned in the presence of `Aisha that the Prophet (ï·º) had appointed `Ali as successor by will. Thereupon she said, "Who said so? I saw the Prophet, while I was supporting him against my chest. He asked for a tray, and then fell on one side and expired, and I did not feel it. So how (do the people say) he appointed `Ali as his successor?"

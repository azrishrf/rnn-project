49 | 13 | 26 | Narrated Marwan and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and they requested him to return theirproperties and captives. The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and said to them, "I have other people with me in thismatter (as you see) and the most beloved statement to me is the true one; you may choose either theproperties or the prisoners as I have delayed their distribution." The Prophet (ﷺ) had waited for them formore than ten days since his arrival from Ta'if. So, when it became evident to them that the Prophet (ﷺ)was not going to return them except one of the two, they said, "We choose our prisoners." TheProphet got up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and said, "Thenafter, these brethren of yours have come to us with repentance, and I see it logical to return them thecaptives. So, whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of youlikes to stick to his share till we recompense him from the very first war booty which Allah will giveus, then he can do so (i.e. give up the present captives)." The people unanimously said, "We do that(return the captives) willingly." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "We do not know which of you has agreed to it andwhich have not, so go back and let your leaders forward us your decision." So, all the people thenwent back and discussed the matter with their leaders who returned and informed the Prophet (ﷺ) that allthe people had willingly given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached us aboutthe captives of Hawazin. Narrated Anas that `Abbas said to the Prophet, "I paid for my ransom and`Aqil's ransom."

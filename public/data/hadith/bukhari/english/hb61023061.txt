61 | 23 | 61 | Narrated Abu Juhaifa: By chance I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) at noon while he was at Al-Abtah (resting) in a tent. Bilal came out(of the tent) and pronounced the Adhan for the prayer, and entering again, he brought out the waterwhich was left after Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had performed the ablution. The people rushed to take some ofthe water. Bilal again went in and brought out a spear-headed stick, and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) cameout. As if I were now looking at the whiteness of his leg. Bilal fixed the stick and the Prophet (ﷺ) offereda two-rak`at Zuhr prayer and a two-rak`at `Asr prayer, while women and donkeys were passing infront of the Prophet (beyond the stick) .

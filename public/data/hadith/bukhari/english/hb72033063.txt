72 | 33 | 63 | Narrated Khalid bin Al-Walid: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and I entered the house of Maimuna. A roasted mastigure was served. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)stretched his hand out (to eat of it) but some woman said, "Inform Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what he is aboutto eat." So they said, "It is mastigure, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" He withdrew his hand, whereupon I said, "OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Is it unlawful?" He said, "No, but this is not found in the land of my people, so Idislike it." So I pulled the mastigure towards me and ate it while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was looking at me.

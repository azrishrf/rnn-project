88 | 3 | 7 | Narrated Abu Huraira: "Abu Bakr said, "By Allah! I will fight whoever differentiates betweenprayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property (according to Allah's Orders). ByAllah! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to pay to Allah's Messenger (ï·º), I would fight withthem for withholding it." `Umar said, "By Allah: It was nothing, but I noticed that Allah opened AbuBakr's chest towards the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right."

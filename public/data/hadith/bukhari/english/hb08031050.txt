8 | 31 | 50 | Narrated `Abdullah: The Prophet (ﷺ) prayed (and the sub-narrator Ibrahim said, "I do not know whether he prayed more or lessthan usual"), and when he had finished the prayers he was asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Has there beenany change in the prayers?" He said, "What is it?' The people said, "You have prayed so much and somuch." So the Prophet (ﷺ) bent his legs, faced the Qibla and performed two prostration's (of Sahu) andfinished his prayers with Taslim (by turning his face to right and left saying: 'As-Salamu `Alaikum-Warahmat-ullah'). When he turned his face to us he said, "If there had been anything changed in theprayer, surely I would have informed you but I am a human being like you and liable to forget likeyou. So if I forget remind me and if anyone of you is doubtful about his prayer, he should follow whathe thinks to be correct and complete his prayer accordingly and finish it and do two prostrations (ofSahu).

61 | 2 | 11 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "Pride and arrogance are characteristics of the rural bedouins whilecalmness is found among the owners of sheep. Belief is Yemenite, and wisdom is also Yemenite i.e.the Yemenites are well-known for their true belief and wisdom)." Abu `Abdullah (Al-Bukhari) said,"Yemen was called so because it is situated to the right of the Ka`ba, and Sham was called so becauseit is situated to the left of the Ka`ba."

75 | 19 | 33 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "The good deeds of any person will not make him enter Paradise."(i.e., None can enter Paradise through his good deeds.) They (the Prophet's companions) said, 'Noteven you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?' He said, "Not even myself, unless Allah bestows His favor and mercyon me." So be moderate in your religious deeds and do the deeds that are within your ability: and noneof you should wish for death, for if he is a good doer, he may increase his good deeds, and if he is anevil doer, he may repent to Allah."

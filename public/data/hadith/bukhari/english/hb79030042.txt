79 | 30 | 42 | Narrated Mu`adh: While I was a companion rider with the Prophet (ï·º) he said, "O Mu`adh!" I replied, "Labbaik waSa`daik." He repeated this call three times and then said, "Do you know what Allah's Right on Hisslaves is?" I replied, "No." He said, Allah's Right on His slaves is that they should worship Him(Alone) and should not join partners in worship with Him." He said, "O Mu`adh!" I replied, "Labbaikwa Sa`daik." He said, "Do you know what the right of (Allah's) salves on Allah is, if they do that(worship Him Alone and join none in His worship)? It is that He will not punish them."(another chain through Mu'adh)

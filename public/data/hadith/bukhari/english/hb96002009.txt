96 | 2 | 9 | Narrated Abu Musa: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "My example and the example of what I have been sent with is that of a man whocame to some people and said, 'O people! I have seen the enemy's army with my own eyes, and I amthe naked warner; so protect yourselves!' Then a group of his people obeyed him and fled at nightproceeding stealthily till they were safe, while another group of them disbelieved him and stayed attheir places till morning when the army came upon them, and killed and ruined them completely Sothis is the example of that person who obeys me and follows what I have brought (the Qur'an and theSunna), and the example of the one who disobeys me and disbelieves the truth I have brought."

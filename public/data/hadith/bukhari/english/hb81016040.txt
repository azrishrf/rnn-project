81 | 16 | 40 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`id: A man passed by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the Prophet (ﷺ) asked a man sitting beside him, "What is youropinion about this (passer-by)?" He replied, "This (passer-by) is from the noble class of people. ByAllah, if he should ask for a lady's hand in marriage, he ought to be given her in marriage, and if heintercedes for somebody, his intercession will be accepted. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept quiet, and thenanother man passed by and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked the same man (his companion) again, "What is youropinion about this (second) one?" He said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This person is one of the poorMuslims. If he should ask a lady's hand in marriage, no-one will accept him, and if he intercedes forsomebody, no one will accept his intercession, and if he talks, no-one will listen to his talk." ThenAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "This (poor man) is better than such a large number of the first type (i.e. richmen) as to fill the earth."

67 | 93 | 138 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: One morning we saw the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) weeping, and everyone of them had her family withher, I went to the mosque and found that it was crowded with people. Then `Umar bin Al-Khattabcame and went up to the Prophet (ﷺ) who was in his upper room. He greeted him but nobody answered.He greeted again, but nobody answered. Then the gatekeeper called him and he entered upon theProphet, and asked, "Have you divorced your wives?" The Prophet, said, "No, but I have taken an oathnot to go to them for one month." So the Prophet (ﷺ) stayed away (from his wives) for twenty nine daysand then entered upon them.

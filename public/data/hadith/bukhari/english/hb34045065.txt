34 | 45 | 65 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Both the buyer and the seller have the option of canceling or confirming thebargain, as long as they are still together; and unless they separate or one of them gives the other theoption of keeping or returning the things and a decision is concluded then, in which case the bargain is considered final. If they separate after the bargain and none of them has rejected it, then the bargain is rendered final."

13 | 9 | 20 | Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair: I was with Ibn `Umar when a spear head pierced the sole of his foot and his foot stuck to the paddleof the saddle and I got down and pulled his foot out, and that happened in Mina. Al-Hajjaj got thenews and came to inquire about his health and said, "Alas! If we could only know the man whowounded you!" Ibn `Umar said, "You are the one who wounded me." Al-Hajjaj said, "How is that?"Ibn `Umar said, "You have allowed the arms to be carried on a day on which nobody used to carrythem and you allowed arms to be carried in the Haram even though it was not allowed before."

60 | 50 | 128 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Your period (i.e. the Muslims' period) in comparison to the periods of theprevious nations, is like the period between the `Asr prayer and sunset. And your example incomparison to the Jews and the Christians is like the example of a person who employed somelaborers and asked them, 'Who will work for me till midday for one Qirat each?' The Jews worked forhalf a day for one Qirat each. The person asked, 'Who will do the work for me from midday to thetime of the `Asr (prayer) for one Qirat each?' The Christians worked from midday till the `Asr prayerfor one Qirat. Then the person asked, 'Who will do the work for me from the `Asr till sunset for twoQirats each?' " The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are doing the work from the `Asr tillsunset, so you will have a double reward. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, 'We havedone more work but got less wages.' Allah said, 'Have I been unjust to you as regards your rights?'They said, 'No.' So Allah said, 'Then it is My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. "

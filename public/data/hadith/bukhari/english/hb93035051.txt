Saba'na! " Khalid kept on killing some of them and taking some others as captives, and hegave a captive to everyone of us and ordered everyone of us to kill his captive. I said, "By Allah, Ishall not kill my captive and none of my companions shall kill his captive!" Then we mentioned thatto the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said, "O Allah! I am free from what Khalid bin Al-Walid has done," andrepeated it twice.

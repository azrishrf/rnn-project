62 | 30 | 121 | Narrated Hisham's father: The people used to send presents to the Prophet (ﷺ) on the day of `Aisha's turn. `Aisha said, "Mycompanions (i.e. the other wives of the Prophet) gathered in the house of Um Salama and said, "O UmSalama! By Allah, the people choose to send presents on the day of `Aisha's turn and we too, love thegood (i.e. presents etc.) as `Aisha does. You should tell Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to tell the people to send theirpresents to him wherever he may be, or wherever his turn may be." Um Salama said that to theProphet and he turned away from her, and when the Prophet (ﷺ) returned to her (i.e. Um Salama), sherepeated the same, and the Prophet (ﷺ) again turned away, and when she told him the same for the thirdtime, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Um Salama! Don't trouble me by harming `Aisha, for by Allah, the DivineInspiration never came to me while I was under the blanket of any woman amongst you except her."

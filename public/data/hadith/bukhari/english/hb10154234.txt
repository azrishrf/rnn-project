10 | 154 | 234 | Narrated Mahmud bin Ar-Rabi`: I heard from `Itban bin Malik Al-Ansari, who was one from Bani Salim, saying,"I used to lead my tribe of Bani Salim in prayer. Once I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said to him, 'I haveweak eyesight and at times the rainwater flood intervenes between me and the mosque of my tribe andI wish that you would come to my house and pray at some place so that I could take that place as aplace for praying (mosque). He said, "Allah willing, I shall do that." Next day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) alongwith Abu Bakr, came to my house after the sun had risen high and he asked permission to enter. I gavehim permission, but he didn't sit till he said to me, "Where do you want me to pray in your house?" Ipointed to a place in the house where I wanted him to pray. So he stood up for the prayer and wealigned behind him. He completed the prayer with Taslim and we did the same simultaneously."

16 | 17 | 23 | Narrated Abu Bakra: In the lifetime of the Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed and he went out dragging his clothestill he reached the Mosque. The people gathered around him and he led them and offered two rak`at.When the sun (eclipse) cleared, he said, "The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs ofAllah; they do not eclipse because of the death of someone, and so when an eclipse occurs, pray andinvoke Allah till the eclipse is over." It happened that a son of the Prophet (ﷺ) called Ibrahim died on thatday and the people were talking about that (saying that the eclipse was caused by his death).

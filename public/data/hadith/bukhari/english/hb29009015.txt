29 | 9 | 15 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned,was his saying, "Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances ofMedina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man orone of the best men will come up to him and say, 'I testify that you are the same Dajjal whosedescription was given to us by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) .' Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, 'If I kill this manand bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?' They will say, 'No.' Then Ad-Dajjal willkill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, 'Now I know your reality better thanbefore.' Ad-Dajjal will say, 'I want to kill him but I cannot.' "

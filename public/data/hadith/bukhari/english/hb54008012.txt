Do not practice Najsh (i.e. Do not offera high price for a thing which you do not want to buy, in order to deceive the people). No Muslimshould offer more for a thing already bought by his Muslim brother, nor should he demand the hand ofa girl already engaged to another Muslim. A Muslim woman shall not try to bring about The divorceof her sister (i.e. another Muslim woman) in order to take her place herself."

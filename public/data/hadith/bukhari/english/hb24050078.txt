Theyagain asked him for (something) and he again gave them. And then they asked him and he gave themagain till all that was with him finished. And then he said "If I had anything. I would not keep it awayfrom you. (Remember) Whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him contented, andwhoever tries to make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him self-sufficient. And whoeverremains patient, Allah will make him patient. Nobody can be given a blessing better and greater thanpatience."

52 | 4 | 4 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from `Uqba bin Al-Harith: `Uqba married the daughter of Abu Ihab bin `Aziz, and then a woman came and said, "I suckled`Uqba and his wife." `Uqba said to her, "I do not know that you have suckled me, and you did notinform me." He then sent someone to the house of Abu Ihab to inquire about that but they did notknow that she had suckled their daughter. Then `Uqba went to the Prophet (ﷺ) in Medina and asked himabout it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, "How (can you keep your wife) after it has been said (that both ofyou were suckled by the same woman)?" So, he divorced her and she was married to another(husband).

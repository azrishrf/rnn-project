62 | 5 | 17 | Narrated Abu Ad-Darda: While I was sitting with the Prophet, Abu Bakr came, lifting up one corner of his garment uncoveringhis knee. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Your companion has had a quarrel." Abu Bakr greeted (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) andsaid, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! There was something (i.e. quarrel) between me and the Son of Al-Khattab. Italked to him harshly and then regretted that, and requested him to forgive me, but he refused. This iswhy I have come to you." The Prophet (ﷺ) said thrice, "O Abu Bakr! May Allah forgive you." In themeanwhile, `Umar regretted (his refusal of Abu Bakr's excuse) and went to Abu Bakr's house andasked if Abu Bakr was there. They replied in the negative. So he came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and greeted him,but signs of displeasure appeared on the face of the Prophet (ﷺ) till Abu Bakr pitied (`Umar), so he kneltand said twice, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah! I was more unjust to him (than he to me)." The Prophet (ﷺ)said, "Allah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), 'You are telling a lie,' whileAbu Bakr said, 'He has said the truth,' and consoled me with himself and his money." He then saidtwice, "Won't you then give up harming my companion?" After that nobody harmed Abu Bakr.

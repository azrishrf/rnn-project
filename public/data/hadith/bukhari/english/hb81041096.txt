81 | 41 | 96 | Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Who-ever loves to meet Allah, Allah (too) loves to meet him and who-ever hates tomeet Allah, Allah (too) hates to meet him". `Aisha, or some of the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "But wedislike death." He said: It is not like this, but it is meant that when the time of the death of a believerapproaches, he receives the good news of Allah's pleasure with him and His blessings upon him, andso at that time nothing is dearer to him than what is in front of him. He therefore loves the meetingwith Allah, and Allah (too) loves the meeting with him. But when the time of the death of adisbeliever approaches, he receives the evil news of Allah's torment and His Requital, whereuponnothing is more hateful to him than what is before him. Therefore, he hates the meeting with Allah,and Allah too, hates the meeting with him."

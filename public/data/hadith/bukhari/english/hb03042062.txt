3 | 42 | 62 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt Maimuna bint Al-Harith (the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) whilethe Prophet (ﷺ) was there with her during her night turn. The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the `Isha' prayer (in themosque), returned home and after having prayed four rak`at, he slept. Later on he got up at night andthen asked whether the boy (or he used a similar word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and Istood up by his left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five rak`at followed by twomore rak`at. Then he slept and I heard him snoring and then (after a while) he left for the (Fajr)prayer.

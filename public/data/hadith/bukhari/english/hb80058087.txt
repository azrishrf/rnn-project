80 | 58 | 87 | Narrated `Aisha: The Jews used to greet the Prophet (ﷺ) by saying, "As-Samu 'Alaika (i.e., death be upon you), so Iunderstood what they said, and I said to them, "As-Samu 'alaikum wal-la'na (i.e. Death and Allah'sCurse be upon you)." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Be gentle and calm, O `Aisha, as Allah likes gentleness in allaffairs." I said, "O Allah's Prophet! Didn't you hear what they said?" He said, "Didn't you hear meanswering them back by saying, 'Alaikum (i.e., the same be upon you)?"

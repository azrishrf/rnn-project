58 | 16 | 22 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Abu Bakr, on the day of Nahr (i.e. slaughtering of animals for sacrifice), sent me in the company ofothers to make this announcement: "After this year, no pagan will be allowed to perform the Hajj, andnone will be allowed to perform the Tawaf of the Ka`ba undressed." And the day of Al-Hajj-ul-Akbaris the day of Nahr, and it called Al-Akbar because the people call the `Umra Al-Hajj-ul-Asghar (i.e.the minor Hajj). Abu Bakr threw back the pagans' covenant that year, and therefore, no paganperformed the Hajj in the year of Hajj-ul-Wada` of the Prophets.

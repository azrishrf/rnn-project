Then he washed his private parts and rubbed his hands on the ground, washed themwith water, rinsed his mouth and washed his nose by putting water in it and blowing it out, washed hisface and poured water on his head. He withdrew from that place and washed his feet. A piece of cloth(towel) was given to him but he did not use it.

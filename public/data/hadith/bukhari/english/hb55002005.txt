55 | 2 | 5 | Narrated Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas: The Prophet (ﷺ) came visiting me while I was (sick) in Mecca, ('Amir the sub-narrator said, and hedisliked to die in the land, whence he had already migrated). He (i.e. the Prophet) said, "May Allahbestow His Mercy on Ibn Afra (Sa`d bin Khaula)." I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! May I will all myproperty (in charity)?" He said, "No." I said, "Then may I will half of it?" He said, "No". I said, "Onethird?" He said: "Yes, one third, yet even one third is too much. It is better for you to leave yourinheritors wealthy than to leave them poor begging others, and whatever you spend for Allah's sakewill be considered as a charitable deed even the handful of food you put in your wife's mouth. Allahmay lengthen your age so that some people may benefit by you, and some others be harmed by you."At that time Sa`d had only one daughter.

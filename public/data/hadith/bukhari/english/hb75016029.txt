75 | 16 | 29 | Narrated Sa`d: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) came to visit me during my ailment which had been aggravated during Hajjat-al-Wada`. I said to him, "You see how sick I am. I have much property but have no heir except my onlydaughter May I give two thirds of my property in charity?"! He said, "No." I said, "Half of it?" Hesaid, "No." I said "One third?" He said, "One third is too much, for to leave your heirs rich is betterthan to leave them poor, begging of others. Nothing you spend seeking Allah's pleasure but you shallget a reward for it, even for what you put in the mouth of your wife."

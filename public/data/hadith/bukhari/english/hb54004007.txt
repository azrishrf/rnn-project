The camel became so fast as it had never been before. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, "Sell itto me for one Uqiyya (of gold)." I said, "No." He again said, "Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold)." Isold it and stipulated that I should ride it to my house. When we reached (Medina) I took that camel tothe Prophet (ﷺ) and he gave me its price.

68 | 8 | 17 | Narrated `Ubaid bin `Umar: I heard `Aisha saying, "The Prophet (ﷺ) used to stay for a long while with Zanab bint Jahsh and drinkhoney at her house. So Hafsa and I decided that if the Prophet (ﷺ) came to anyone of us, she should sayhim, "I detect the smell of Maghafir (a nasty smelling gum) in you. Have you eaten Maghafir?' " Sothe Prophet (ﷺ) visited one of them and she said to him similarly. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Never mind, I havetaken some honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I shall never drink of it anymore." So therewas revealed: 'O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you . . . Ifyou two (wives of Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah,' (66.1-4) addressing Aisha and Hafsa. 'Whenthe Prophet (ﷺ) disclosed a matter in confidence to some of his wives.' (66.3) namely his saying: But Ihave taken some honey."

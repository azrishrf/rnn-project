Whilesleeping near the Ka`ba last night, I saw in my dream a man of brown color the best one can seeamongst brown color and his hair was long that it fell between his shoulders. His hair was lank andwater was dribbling from his head and he was placing his hands on the shoulders of two men whilecircumambulating the Ka`ba. I asked, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'This is Jesus, son of Mary.' Behindhim I saw a man who had very curly hair and was blind in the right eye, resembling Ibn Qatan (i.e. aninfidel) in appearance. He was placing his hands on the shoulders of a person while performing Tawafaround the Ka`ba. I asked, 'Who is this? 'They replied, 'The Masih, Ad-Dajjal.' "

4 | 56 | 84 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) once passed by two graves and said, "These two persons are being tortured not for a major sin (to avoid). One of them never saved himself from being soiled with his urine, while theother used to go about with calumnies (to make enmity between friends)." The Prophet (ﷺ) then took agreen leaf of a date-palm tree, split it into (pieces) and fixed one on each grave. They said, "O Allah'sApostle! Why have you done so?" He replied, "I hope that their punishment might be lessened tillthese (the pieces of the leaf) become dry."

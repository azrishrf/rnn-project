42 | 12 | 20 | Narrated Zaid bin Khalid: A man came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked about Al-Luqata (a fallen thing). The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Recognize its container and its tying material and then make a public announcement about it for oneyear and if its owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise use it as you like." The man said, "Whatabout a lost sheep?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "It is for you, your brother or the wolf." The man said "Whatabout a lost camel?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Why should you take it as it has got its water-container (itsstomach) and its hooves and it can reach the places of water and can eat the trees till its owner findsit?"

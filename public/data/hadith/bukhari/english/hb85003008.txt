85 | 3 | 8 | Narrated Malik bin Aus: I went and entered upon `Umar, his doorman, Yarfa came saying `Uthman, `Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa`d are asking your permission (to see you). May I admit them? `Umar said, 'Yes.' So headmitted them Then he came again and said, 'May I admit `Ali and `Abbas?' He said, 'Yes.' `Abbassaid, 'O, chief of the believers! Judge between me and this man (Ali ). `Umar said, 'I beseech you byAllah by Whose permission both the heaven and the earth exist, do you know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)said, 'Our (the Apostles') property will not be inherited, and whatever we leave (after our death) is tobe spent in charity?' And by that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) meant himself.' The group said, '(No doubt), he saidso.' `Umar then faced `Ali and `Abbas and said, 'Do you both know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said that?'They replied, '(No doubt), he said so.' `Umar said, 'So let me talk to you about this matter. Allahfavored His Apostle with something of this Fai' (i.e. booty won by the Muslims at war withoutfighting) which He did not give to anybody else;Allah said:-- 'And what Allah gave to His Apostle ( Fai' Booty) .........to do all things....(59.6) And sothat property was only for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . Yet, by Allah, he neither gathered that property forhimself nor withheld it from you, but he gave its income to you, and distributed it among you till thereremained the present property out of which the Prophet (ﷺ) used to spend the yearly maintenance for hisfamily, and whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah's property is spent (i.e. in charityetc.). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) followed that throughout his life.Now I beseech you by Allah, do you know all that?' They said, 'Yes.' `Umar then said to `Ali and`Abbas, 'I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?' Both of them said, 'Yes.' `Umar added, 'Andwhen the Prophet (ﷺ) died, Abu Bakr said, ' I am the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and took charge of thatproperty and managed it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did.Then I took charge of this property for two years during which I managed it as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) andAbu Bakr did. Then you both (`Ali and `Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim andpresenting the same case. (O `Abbas!) You came to me asking for your share from the property ofyour nephew, and this man (Ali) came to me, asking for the share of h is wife from the property of herfather. I said, 'If you both wish, I will give that to you on that condition (i.e. that you would follow theway of the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr and as I (`Umar) have done in man aging it).' Now both of you seekof me a verdict other than that? Lo! By Allah, by Whose permission both the heaven and the earthexist, I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established. If you are unable tomanage it, then return it to me, and I will be sufficient to manage it on your behalf.' "

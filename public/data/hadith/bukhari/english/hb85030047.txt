85 | 30 | 47 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "There were two women with whom there were their two sons. A wolf came andtook away the son of one of them. That lady said to her companion, 'The wolf has taken your son.' Theother said, 'But it has taken your son.' So both of them sought the judgment of (the Prophet) Davidwho judged that the boy should be given to the older lady. Then both of them went to (the Prophet)Solomon, son of David and informed him of the case. Solomon said, 'Give me a knife so that I maycut the child into two portions and give one half to each of you.' The younger lady said, 'Do not do so;may Allah bless you ! He is her child.' On that, he gave the child to the younger lady." Abu Hurairaadded: By Allah! I had never heard the word 'Sakkin' as meaning knife, except on that day, for weused to call it "Mudya".

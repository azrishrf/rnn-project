Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)after conquering Khaibar, thought of expelling the Jews from the land which, after he conquered itbelonged to Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the Muslims. But the Jews requested Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to leavethem there on the condition that they would do the labor and get half of the fruits (the land wouldyield).

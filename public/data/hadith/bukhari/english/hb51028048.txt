51 | 28 | 48 | Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr: We were one-hundred and thirty persons accompanying the Prophet (ﷺ) who asked us whether anyone ofus had food. There was a man who had about a Sa of wheat which was mixed with water then. A verytall pagan came driving sheep. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, "Will you sell us (a sheep) or give it as apresent?" He said, "I will sell you (a sheep)." The Prophet (ﷺ) bought a sheep and it was slaughtered. TheProphet ordered that its liver and other Abdominal organs be roasted. By Allah, the Prophet (ﷺ) gaveevery person of the one-hundred-and-thirty a piece of that; he gave all those of them who werepresent; and kept the shares of those who were absent. The Prophet (ﷺ) then put its meat in two hugebasins and all of them ate to their fill, and even then more food was left in the two basins which werecarried on the camel (or said something like it).

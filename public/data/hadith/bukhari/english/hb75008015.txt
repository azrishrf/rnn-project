75 | 8 | 15 | Narrated `Aisha: When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal got a fever. I entered upon them andasked, "O my father! How are you? O Bilal! How are you?" Whenever fever attacked Abu Bakr, hewould recite the following poetic verses: 'Everybody is staying alive among his people, yet death isnearer to him than his shoe laces." And whenever the fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poeticlines): 'Would that I could stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir andJalil (two kinds of good smelling grass). Would that one day I would drink of the water of Majinnaand would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me.' Then I came andinformed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about that, whereupon he said, "O Allah! Make us love Medina as much ormore than we love Mecca. O Allah! Make it healthy and bless its Mudd and Sa for us, and take awayits fever and put it in Al Juhfa."

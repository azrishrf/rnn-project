47 | 15 | 21 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (along with his companions) reached Mecca in the morning of the fourth of Dhul-Hijjaassuming Ihram for Hajj only. So when we arrived at Mecca, the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered us to change ourintentions of the Ihram for `Umra and that we could finish our Ihram after performing the `Umra andcould go to our wives (for sexual intercourse). The people began talking about that. Jabir saidsurprisingly, "Shall we go to Mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs?" Jabir moved hishand while saying so. When this news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) he delivered a sermon and said, "I havebeen informed that some peoples were saying so and so; By Allah I fear Allah more than you do, andam more obedient to Him than you. If I had known what I know now, I would not have brought theHadi (sacrifice) with me and had the Hadi not been with me, I would have finished the Ihram." At thatSuraqa bin Malik stood up and asked "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Is this permission for us only or is itforever?" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "It is forever." In the meantime `Ali bin Abu Talib came from Yemenand was saying Labbaik for what the Prophet (ﷺ) has intended. (According to another man, `Ali wassaying Labbaik for Hajj similar to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)'s). The Prophet (ﷺ) told him to keep on the Ihram andlet him share the Hadi with him.

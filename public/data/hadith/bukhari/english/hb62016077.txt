62 | 16 | 77 | Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: `Ali demanded the hand of the daughter of Abu Jahl. Fatima heard of this and went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)saying, "Your people think that you do not become angry for the sake of your daughters as `Ali is nowgoing to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. "On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up and after his recitation ofTashah-hud. I heard him saying, "Then after! I married one of my daughters to Abu Al-`As bin Al-Rabi` (the husband of Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) before Islam and he proved truthful inwhatever he said to me. No doubt, Fatima is a part of me, I hate to see her being troubled. By Allah,the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the daughter of Allah's Enemy cannot be the wives of one man."So `Ali gave up that engagement.'Al-Miswar further said: I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) talking and he mentioned a son-in-law of his belonging tothe tribe of Bani `Abd-Shams. He highly praised him concerning that relationship and said (whenever)he spoke to me, he spoke the truth, and whenever he promised me, he fulfilled his promise."

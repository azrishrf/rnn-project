8 | 6 | 13 | Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Harith: I asked Jabir bin `Abdullah about praying in a single garment. He said, "I traveled with the Prophet (ï·º)during some of his journeys, and I came to him at night for some purpose and I found him praying. Atthat time, I was wearing a single garment with which I covered my shoulders and prayed by his side.When he finished the prayer, he asked, 'O Jabir! What has brought you here?' I told him what Iwanted. When I finished, he asked, 'O Jabir! What is this garment which I have seen and with whichyou covered your shoulders?' I replied, 'It is a (tight) garment.' He said, 'If the garment is largeenough, wrap it round the body (covering the shoulders) and if it is tight (too short) then use it as anIzar (tie it around your waist only.)' "

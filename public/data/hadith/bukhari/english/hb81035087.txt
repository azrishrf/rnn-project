81 | 35 | 87 | Narrated Hudhaifa: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) narrated to us two narrations, one of which I have seen (happening) and I am waitingfor the other. He narrated that honesty was preserved in the roots of the hearts of men (in thebeginning) and then they learnt it (honesty) from the Qur'an, and then they learnt it from the(Prophet's) Sunna (tradition). He also told us about its disappearance, saying, "A man will go to sleepwhereupon honesty will be taken away from his heart, and only its trace will remain, resembling thetraces of fire. He then will sleep whereupon the remainder of the honesty will also be taken away(from his heart) and its trace will resemble a blister which is raised over the surface of skin, when anember touches one's foot; and in fact, this blister does not contain anything. So there will come a daywhen people will deal in business with each other but there will hardly be any trustworthy personsamong them. Then it will be said that in such-and-such a tribe there is such-and-such person who ishonest, and a man will be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength, though indeed hewill not have belief equal to a mustard seed in his heart." The narrator added: There came upon me atime when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his religion wouldprevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim ruler would prevent him fromcheating; but today I cannot deal except with so-and-so and so-and-so.

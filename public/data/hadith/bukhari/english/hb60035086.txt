60 | 35 | 86 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Once while a Jew was selling something, he was offered a price that he was not pleased with. So, hesaid, "No, by Him Who gave Moses superiority over all human beings!" Hearing him, an Ansari mangot up and slapped him on the face and said, "You say: By Him Who Gave Moses superiority over allhuman beings although the Prophet (Muhammad) is present amongst us!" The Jew went to theProphet and said, "O Abu-l-Qasim! I am under the assurance and contract of security, so what rightdoes so-and-so have to slap me?" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked the other, "Why have you slapped". He told himthe whole story. The Prophet (ﷺ) became angry, till anger appeared on his face, and said, "Don't givesuperiority to any prophet amongst Allah's Prophets, for when the trumpet will be blown, everyone onthe earth and in the heavens will become unconscious except those whom Allah will exempt. Thetrumpet will be blown for the second time and I will be the first to be resurrected to see Moses holdingAllah's Throne. I will not know whether the unconsciousness which Moses received on the Day of Turhas been sufficient for him, or has he got up before me. And I do not say that there is anybody who isbetter than Yunus bin Matta."

40 | 7 | 8 | Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin after embracing Islam, came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), he got up.They appealed to him to return their properties and their captives. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them, "Themost beloved statement to me is the true one. So, you have the option of restoring your properties oryour captives, for I have delayed distributing them." The narrator added, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) c had beenwaiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When they realized that Allah'sApostle would return to them only one of two things, they said, "We choose our captives." So, Allah'sApostle got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised Allah as He deserved, and said, "Then after!These brethren of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return their captivesto them. So, whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of youwants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first booty which Allah will give us then hecan do so." The people replied, "We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor for Allah'sApostle." Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "We don't know who amongst you has agreed and who hasn't. Goback and your chiefs may tell us your opinion." So, all of them returned and their chiefs discussed thematter with them and then they (i.e. their chiefs) came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to tell him that they (i.e. thepeople) had given up their shares gladly and willingly.

11 | 13 | 24 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: One of the wives of `Umar (bin Al-Khattab) used to offer the Fajr and the `Isha' prayer incongregation in the Mosque. She was asked why she had come out for the prayer as she knew that`Umar disliked it, and he has great ghaira (self-respect). She replied, "What prevents him fromstopping me from this act?" The other replied, "The statement of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) : 'Do notstop Allah's women-slaves from going to Allah's Mosques' prevents him."

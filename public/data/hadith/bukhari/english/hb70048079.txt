Then she sent me to the Prophet, and I reached himwhile he was sitting with his companions. I invited him, whereupon he said, "And those who are withme?' I returned and said, "He says, 'And those who are with me?" Abu Talha went out to him and said,"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! It is just a meal prepared by Um Sulaim." The Prophet (ﷺ) entered and the food wasbrought to him. He said, "Let ten persons enter upon me." Those ten entered and ate their fill. Againhe said, 'Let ten (more) enter upon me." Those ten entered and ate their fill. Then he said, "Let ten(more) enter upon me." He called forty persons in all Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ate and got up. I startedlooking (at the food) to see if it decreased or not.

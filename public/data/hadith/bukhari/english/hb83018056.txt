83 | 18 | 56 | Narrated Abu Musa: My companions sent me to the Prophet (ﷺ) to ask him for some mounts. He said, "By Allah! I will notmount you on anything!" When I met him, he was in an angry mood, but when I met him (again), hesaid, "Tell your companions that Allah or Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) will provide you with mounts."

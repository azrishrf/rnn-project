85 | 8 | 14 | Narrated Huzail bin Shirahbil: Abu Musa was asked regarding (the inheritance of) a daughter, a son's daughter, and a sister. He said,"The daughter will take one-half and the sister will take one-half. If you go to Ibn Mas`ud, he will tellyou the same." Ibn Mas`ud was asked and was told of Abu Musa's verdict. Ibn Mas`ud then said, "If Igive the same verdict, I would stray and would not be of the rightly-guided. The verdict I will give inthis case, will be the same as the Prophet (ï·º) did, i.e. one-half is for daughter, and one-sixth for the son'sdaughter, i.e. both shares make two-thirds of the total property; and the rest is for the sister."Afterwards we cams to Abu Musa and informed him of Ibn Mas`ud's verdict, whereupon he said, "So,do not ask me for verdicts, as long as this learned man is among you."

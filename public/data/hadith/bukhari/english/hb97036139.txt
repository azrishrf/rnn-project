97 | 36 | 139 | Narrated Safwan bin Muhriz: A man asked Ibn `Umar, "What have you heard from Allah's Messenger (ï·º) regarding An-Najwa?" He said, "Everyone of you will come close to His Lord Who will screen him from the people and say to him, 'Did you do so-and-so?' He will reply, 'Yes.' Then Allah will say, 'Did you do so-and-so?' He will reply, 'Yes.' So Allah will question him and make him confess, and then Allah will say, 'I screened your sins in the world and forgive them for you today.' "

21 | 11 | 15 | Narrated Al-Azraq bin Qais: We were at Al-Ahwaz fighting the Al-Haruriya (tribe). While I was at the bank of a river a man waspraying and the reins of his animal were in his hands and the animal was struggling and he wasfollowing the animal. (Shu`ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza Al-Aslami). A man fromthe Khawarij said, "O Allah! Be harsh to this sheik." And when the sheik (Abu Barza) finished hisprayer, he said, "I heard your remark. No doubt, I participated with Allah's Messenger (ï·º) in six or seven oreight holy battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt, I would rather retain my animal than let it returnto its stable, as it would cause me much trouble. "

60 | 44 | 102 | Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab: Abu Huraira said, "I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, 'There is none born among the off-spring of Adam,but Satan touches it. A child therefore, cries loudly at the time of birth because of the touch of Satan,except Mary and her child." Then Abu Huraira recited: "And I seek refuge with You for her and forher offspring from the outcast Satan" (3.36)

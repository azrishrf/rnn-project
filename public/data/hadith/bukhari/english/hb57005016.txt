57 | 5 | 16 | Narrated `Ali bin Al-Husain: That when they reached Medina after returning from Yazid bin Mu'awaiya after the martyrdom ofHusain bin `Ali (may Allah bestow His Mercy upon him), Al-Miswar bin Makhrama met him and saidto him, "Do you have any need you may order me to satisfy?" `Ali said, "No." Al-Miswar said, Willyou give me the sword of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for I am afraid that people may take it from you by force?By Allah, if you give it to me, they will never be able to take it till I die." When `Ali bin Abu Talibdemanded the hand of the daughter of Abi Jahal to be his wife besides Fatima, I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)on his pulpit delivering a sermon in this connection before the people, and I had then attained my ageof puberty. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Fatima is from me, and I am afraid she will be subjected to trials inher religion (because of jealousy)." The Prophet (ﷺ) then mentioned one of his son-in-law who was fromthe tribe of 'Abu Shams, and he praised him as a good son-in-law, saying, "Whatever he said was thetruth, and he promised me and fulfilled his promise. I do not make a legal thing illegal, nor do I makean illegal thing legal, but by Allah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the daughter of the enemy ofAllah, (i.e. Abu Jahl) can never get together (as the wives of one man)

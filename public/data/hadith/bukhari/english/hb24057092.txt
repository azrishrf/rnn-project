24 | 57 | 92 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Dates used to be brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) immediately after being plucked. Different persons wouldbring their dates till a big heap collected (in front of the Prophet). Once Al-Hasan and Al-Husain wereplaying with these dates. One of them took a date and put it in his mouth. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked athim and took it out from his mouth and said, "Don't you know that Muhammad's offspring do not eatwhat is given in charity?"

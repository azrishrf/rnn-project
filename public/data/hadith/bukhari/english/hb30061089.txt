30 | 61 | 89 | Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) paid a visit to Um-Sulaim and she placed before him dates and ghee. The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Replace the ghee and dates in their respective containers for I am fasting." Then he stood somewherein her house and offered an optional prayer and then he invoked good on Um-Sulaim and her family.Then Um-Sulaim said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have a special request (today)." He said, "What is it?"She replied, "(Please invoke for) your servant Anas." So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not leave anything goodin the world or the Hereafter which he did not invoke (Allah to bestow) on me and said, "O Allah!Give him (i.e. Anas) property and children and bless him." Thus I am one of the richest among theAnsar and my daughter Umaina told me that when Al-Hajjaj came to Basra, more than 120 of myoffspring had been buried.

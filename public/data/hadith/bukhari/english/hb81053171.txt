I asked, 'Where?' He said, 'To the (Hell) Fire, by Allah' I asked, 'what is wrongwith them' He said, 'They turned apostate as renegades after you left.' Then behold! (Another) group(of my followers) were brought close to me, and when I recognized them, a man (an angel) came outfrom (me and them) he said (to them); Come along.' I asked, "Where?' He said, 'To the (Hell) Fire, byAllah.' I asked, What is wrong with them?' He said, 'They turned apostate as renegades after you left.So I did not see anyone of them escaping except a few who were like camels without a shepherd."

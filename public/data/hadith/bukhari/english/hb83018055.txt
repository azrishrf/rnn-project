83 | 18 | 55 | Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari: I went along with some men from the Ash-ariyin to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and it happened that I met himwhile he was in an angry mood. We asked him to provide us with mounts, but he swore that he wouldnot give us any. Later on he said, "By Allah, Allah willing, if ever I take an oath (to do something)and later on I find something else better than the first, then I do the better one and give expiation forthe dissolution of my oath."

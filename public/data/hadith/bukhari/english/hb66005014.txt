66 | 5 | 14 | Narrated `Umar bin Al-Khattab: I heard Hisham bin Hakim reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Ilistened to his recitation and noticed that he recited in several different ways which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)had not taught me. I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper, andwhen he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it andsaid, "Who taught you this Sura which I heard you reciting?" He replied, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) taught it tome." I said, "You have told a lie, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has taught it to me in a different way fromyours." So I dragged him to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said (to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)),"I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven't taught me!" On that Allah'sApostle said, "Release him, (O `Umar!) Recite, O Hisham!" Then he recited in the same way as Iheard him reciting. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "It was revealed in this way," and added, "Recite, O`Umar!" I recited it as he had taught me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, "It was revealed in this way. ThisQur'an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easierfor you (or read as much of it as may be easy for you).

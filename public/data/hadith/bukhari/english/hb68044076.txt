68 | 44 | 76 | Narrated Al-Hasan: The sister of Ma'qil bin Yasar was married to a man and then that man divorced her and remainedaway from her till her period of the 'Iddah expired. Then he demanded for her hand in marriage, butMa'qil got angry out of pride and haughtiness and said, "He kept away from her when he could stillretain her, and now he demands her hand again?" So Ma'qil disagreed to remarry her to him. ThenAllah revealed: 'When you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribedperiod, do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands.' (2.232) So the Prophet (ï·º) sent forMa'qil and recited to him (Allah's order) and consequently Ma'qil gave up his pride and haughtinessand yielded to Allah's order.

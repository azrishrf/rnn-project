68 | 46 | 80 | Narrated Um Salama: I (Humaid) said to Zainab, "What does 'throwing a globe of dung when oneyear had elapsed' mean?" Zainab said, "When a lady was bereaved of her husband, she would live in awretched small room and put on the worst clothes she had and would not touch any scent till one yearhad elapsed. Then she would bring an animal, e.g. a donkey, a sheep or a bird and rub her bodyagainst it. The animal against which she would rub her body would scarcely survive. Only then shewould come out of her room, whereupon she would be given a globe of dung which she would throwaway and then she would use the scent she liked or the like."

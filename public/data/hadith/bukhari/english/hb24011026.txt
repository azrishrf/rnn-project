He replied, "The charity which you practice while you are healthy, niggardly and afraid ofpoverty and wish to become wealthy. Do not delay it to the time of approaching death and then say,'Give so much to such and such, and so much to such and such.' And it has already belonged to suchand such (as it is too late)."

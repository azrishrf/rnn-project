61 | 25 | 134 | Narrated Salim bin Abi Aj-Jad: Jabir bin `Abdullah said, "The people became very thirsty on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (Treaty). Asmall pot containing some water was in front of the Prophet (ï·º) and when he had finished the ablution,the people rushed towards him. He asked, 'What is wrong with you?' They replied, 'We have no watereither for performing ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.' So he placed hishand in that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank andperformed ablution (from it)." I asked Jabir, "How many were you?" he replied, "Even if we had beenone-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for us, but we were fifteen-hundred."

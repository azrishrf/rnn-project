81 | 23 | 66 | Narrated Abu Shuraih Al-Khuza`i: My ears heard and my heart grasped (the statement which) the Prophet (ï·º) said, "The period for keepingone's guest is three days (and don't forget) his reward." It was asked, "What is his reward?" He said,"In the first night and the day he should be given a high class quality of meals; and whoever believesin Allah and the Last Day, should entertain his guest generously; and whoever believes in Allah andthe Last Day should talk what is good (sense) or keep quiet."

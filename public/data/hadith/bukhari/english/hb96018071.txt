The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up there and called them, saying,"O assembly of Jews! Surrender to Allah (embrace Islam) and you will be safe!" They said, "Youhave conveyed Allah's message, O Aba-al-Qasim" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said to them, "That is what Iwant; embrace Islam and you will be safe." They said, "You have conveyed the message, O Aba-al-Qasim." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said to them, "That is what I want," and repeated his words for the thirdtime and added, "Know that the earth is for Allah and I want to exile you from this land, so whoeveramong you has property he should sell it, otherwise, know that the land is for Allah and His Apostle."

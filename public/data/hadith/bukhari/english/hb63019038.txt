63 | 19 | 38 | Narrated Abu Burda: When I came to Medina. I met `Abdullah bin Salam. He said, "Will you come to me so that I mayserve you with Sawiq (i.e. powdered barley) and dates, and let you enter a (blessed) house that inwhich the Prophet (ï·º) entered?" Then he added, "You are In a country where the practice of Riba (i.e.usury) is prevalent; so if somebody owe you something and he sends you a present of a load ofchopped straw or a load of barley or a load of provender then do not take it, as it is Riba."

62 | 5 | 15 | Narrated `Amr bin Al-As: The Prophet (ï·º) deputed me to read the Army of Dhat-as-Salasil. I came to him and said, "Who is themost beloved person to you?" He said, " `Aisha." I asked, "Among the men?" He said, "Her father." Isaid, "Who then?" He said, "Then `Umar bin Al-Khattab." He then named other men.

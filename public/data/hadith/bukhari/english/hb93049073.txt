The Prophet (ﷺ)added: Whoever amongst you fulfill his pledge, his reward will be with Allah, and whoever commitsany of those sins and receives the legal punishment in this world for that sin, then that punishment willbe an expiation for that sin, and whoever commits any of those sins and Allah does not expose him,then it is up to Allah if He wishes He will punish him or if He wishes, He will forgive him." So wegave the Pledge for that.

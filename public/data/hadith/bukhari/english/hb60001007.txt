60 | 1 | 7 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Allah has appointed an angel in the womb, and the angel says, 'O Lord! A drop ofdischarge (i.e. of semen), O Lord! a clot, O Lord! a piece of flesh.' And then, if Allah wishes tocomplete the child's creation, the angel will say. 'O Lord! A male or a female? O Lord! wretched orblessed (in religion)? What will his livelihood be? What will his age be?' The angel writes all thiswhile the child is in the womb of its mother."

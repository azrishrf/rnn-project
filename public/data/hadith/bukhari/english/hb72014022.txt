We are living in the land of the people of theScripture, and we take our meals in their utensils, and there is game in that land and I hunt with mybow and with my trained hound and with my untrained hound." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "As for your sayingthat you are in the land of people of the Scripture, you should not eat in their utensils unless you findno alternative, in which case you must wash the utensils and then eat in them As for your saying thatyou are in the land of game, if you hunt something with your bow, mention Allah's Name (whilehunting the game) and eat; and if you hunt something with your trained hound, mention Allah's Nameon sending and eat; and if you hunt something with your untrained hound and get it alive, slaughter itand you can eat of it."

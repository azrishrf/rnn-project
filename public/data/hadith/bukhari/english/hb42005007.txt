42 | 5 | 7 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "There are three persons whom Allah will not look at on the Day ofResurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs shall be a severe punishment. They are:-1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he withheld it from travelers.-2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he gave it only for worldly benefits. If theruler gives him something he gets satisfied, and if the ruler withholds something from him, he getsdissatisfied.-3. And man displayed his goods for sale after the `Asr prayer and he said, 'By Allah, except WhomNone has the right to be worshipped, I have been given so much for my goods,' and somebodybelieves him (and buys them).The Prophet (ﷺ) then recited: "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant andtheir oaths." (3.77)

97 | 31 | 93 | Narrated `Ali bin Abi Talib: That one night Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) visited him and Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said to them, "Won 't you offer (night) prayer?.. `Ali added: I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Our souls are in the Hand of Allah and when He Wishes to bring us to life, He does." Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went away when I said so and he did not give any reply. Then I heard him on leaving while he was striking his thighs, saying, 'But man is, more quarrelsome than anything.' (18.54)

While I was sitting with `Umar bin Al-Khattab afuneral procession passed by and the people praised the deceased. `Umar said, "It has been affirmed tohim." And another funeral procession passed by and the people praised the deceased. `Umar said, "Ithas been affirmed to him." A third (funeral procession) passed by and the people spoke badly of thedeceased. He said, "It has been affirmed to him." I (Abu Al-Aswad) asked, "O chief of the believers!What has been affirmed?" He replied, "I said the same as the Prophet (ï·º) had said, that is: if four personstestify the piety of a Muslim, Allah will grant him Paradise." We asked, "If three persons testify hispiety?" He (the Prophet) replied, "Even three." Then we asked, "If two?" He replied, "Even two." Wedid not ask him regarding one witness.

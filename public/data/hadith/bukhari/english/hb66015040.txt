When he stopped reciting, the horse became quiet, and whenhe started again, the horse was startled again. Then he stoppedreciting and the horse became quiet too. He started reciting again andthe horse was startled and troubled once again. Then he stoppedreciting and his son, Yahya was beside the horse. He was afraid thatthe horse might trample on him. When he took the boy away and lookedtowards the sky, he could not see it. The next morning he informed theProphet who said, "Recite, O Ibn Hudair! Recite, O Ibn Hudair!" IbnHudair replied, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! My son, Yahya was near the horseand I was afraid that it might trample on him, so I looked towards thesky, and went to him. When I looked at the sky, I saw something like acloud containing what looked like lamps, so I went out in order not tosee it." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do you know what that was?" Ibn Hudairreplied, "No." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Those were Angels who came near toyou for your voice and if you had kept on reciting till dawn, it wouldhave remained there till morning when people would have seen it as itwould not have disappeared.

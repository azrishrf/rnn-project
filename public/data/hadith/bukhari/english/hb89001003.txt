89 | 1 | 3 | Narrated Qais: I heard Sa`id bin Zaid saying, "I have seen myself tied and forced by `Umar to leave Islam (Before`Umar himself embraced Islam). And if the mountain of Uhud were to collapse for the evil which youpeople had done to `Uthman, then Uhud would have the right to do so." (See Hadith No. 202, Vol. 5)

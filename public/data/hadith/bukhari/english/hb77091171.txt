77 | 91 | 171 | Narrated `Aisha: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned from a journey when I had placed a curtain of mine having pictures over (thedoor of) a chamber of mine. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw it, he tore it and said, "The people who willreceive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who try to make the like ofAllah's creations." So we turned it (i.e., the curtain) into one or two cushions.

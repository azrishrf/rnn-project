11 | 29 | 52 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Once the Prophet (ï·º) ascended the pulpit and it was the last gathering in which he took part. He wascovering his shoulder with a big cloak and binding his head with an oily bandage. He glorified andpraised Allah and said, "O people! Come to me." So the people came and gathered around him and hethen said, "Amma ba'du." "From now onward the Ansar will decrease and other people will increase.So anybody who becomes a ruler of the followers of Muhammad and has the power to harm or benefitpeople then he should accept the good from the benevolent amongst them (Ansar) and overlook thefaults of their wrong-doers."

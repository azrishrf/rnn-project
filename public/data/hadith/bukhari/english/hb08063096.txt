He picked up his Rida', wore it and sat down andstarted narrating till the topic of the construction of the mosque reached. He said, "We were carryingone adobe at a time while `Ammar was carrying two. The Prophet (ï·º) saw him and started removing thedust from his body and said, "May Allah be Merciful to `Ammar. He will be inviting them (i.e. hismurderers, the rebellious group) to Paradise and they will invite him to Hell-fire." `Ammar said, "Iseek refuge with Allah from affliction."

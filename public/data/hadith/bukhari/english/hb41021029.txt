41 | 21 | 29 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The people say that Abu Huraira narrates too many narrations. In fact Allah knows whether I say thetruth or not. They also ask, "Why do the emigrants and the Ansar not narrate as he does?" In fact, myemigrant brethren were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with theirproperties. I was a poor man keeping the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and was satisfied with whatfilled my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were absent,and I used to remember while they forgot (the Hadith). One day the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoever spreadshis sheet till I finish this statement of mine and then gathers it on his chest, will never forget anythingof my statement." So, I spread my covering sheet which was the only garment I had, till the Prophet (ﷺ)finished his statement and then I gathered it over my chest. By Him Who had sent him (i.e. Allah'sApostle) with the truth, since then I did not forget even a single word of that statement of his, until thisday of mine. By Allah, but for two verses in Allah's Book, I would never have related any narration(from the Prophet). (These two verses are): "Verily! Those who conceal the clear signs and theguidance which we have sent down .....(up to) the Merciful.' (2.159-160)

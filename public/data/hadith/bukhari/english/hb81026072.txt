81 | 26 | 72 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "My example and the example of the people is that of a man who madea fire, and when it lighted what was around it, Moths and other insects started falling into the fire. Theman tried (his best) to prevent them, (from falling in the fire) but they overpowered him and rushedinto the fire. The Prophet (ﷺ) added: Now, similarly, I take hold of the knots at your waist (belts) toprevent you from falling into the Fire, but you insist on falling into it."

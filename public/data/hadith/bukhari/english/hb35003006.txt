35 | 3 | 6 | Narrated Muhammad bin Al-Mujalid: `Abdullah bin Shaddad and Abu Burda sent me to `Abdullah bin Abi `Aufa and told me to ask`Abdullah whether the people in the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to pay in advance for wheat (to bedelivered later). `Abdullah replied, "We used to pay in advance to the peasants of Sham for wheat,barley and olive oil of a known specified measure to be delivered in a specified period." I asked (him),"Was the price paid (in advance) to those who had the things to be delivered later?" `Abdullah bin`Aufa replied, "We did not use to ask them about that." Then they sent me to `Abdur Rahman binAbza and I asked him. He replied, "The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to practice Salam in thelifetime of the Prophet; and we did not use to ask them whether they had standing crops or not."

66 | 8 | 22 | Narrated `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud): By Allah other than Whom none has the right to be worshipped! There is no Sura revealed in Allah'sBook but I know at what place it was revealed; and there is no Verse revealed in Allah's Book but Iknow about whom it was revealed. And if I know that there is somebody who knows Allah's Bookbetter than I, and he is at a place that camels can reach, I would go to him.

Heasked again, but he did not answer. He asked for the third time, but he did not answer. On that, `Umarsaid to himself, "May your mother lose you! You have asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) three times, but he didnot answer at all!" `Umar said, "So I made my camel go fast till I was ahead of the people, and I wasafraid that something might be revealed about me. After a little while I heard a call maker calling me,I said, 'I was afraid that some Qur'anic Verse might be revealed about me.' So I went to Allah'sApostle and greeted him. He said, 'Tonight there has been revealed to me a Surah which is dearer tome than that on which the sun shines (i.e. the world).' Then he recited: 'Verily! We have given you (OMuhammad), a manifest victory.' " (Surat al-Fath) No. (48.1).

81 | 10 | 26 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "If the son of Adam had money equal to a valley, then he will wish foranother similar to it, for nothing can satisfy the eye of Adam's son except dust. And Allah forgiveshim who repents to Him." Ibn `Abbas said: I do not know whether this saying was quoted from theQur'an or not. `Ata' said, "I heard Ibn AzZubair saying this narration while he was on the pulpit."

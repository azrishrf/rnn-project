14 | 7 | 12 | Narrated `Asim: I asked Anas bin Malik about the Qunut. Anas replied, "Definitely it was (recited)". I asked, "Beforebowing or after it?" Anas replied, "Before bowing." I added, "So and so has told me that you hadinformed him that it had been after bowing." Anas said, "He told an untruth (i.e. "was mistaken,"according to the Hijazi dialect). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited Qunut after bowing for a period of onemonth." Anas added, "The Prophet (ﷺ) sent about seventy men (who knew the Qur'an by heart) towardsthe pagans (of Najd) who were less than they in number and there was a peace treaty between themand Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (but the Pagans broke the treaty and killed the seventy men). So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)recited Qunut for a period of one month asking Allah to punish them."

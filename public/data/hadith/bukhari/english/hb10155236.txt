10 | 155 | 236 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Some poor people came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "The wealthy people will get higher grades and willhave permanent enjoyment and they pray like us and fast as we do. They have more money by whichthey perform the Hajj, and `Umra; fight and struggle in Allah's Cause and give in charity." TheProphet said, "Shall I not tell you a thing upon which if you acted you would catch up with those whohave surpassed you? Nobody would overtake you and you would be better than the people amongstwhom you live except those who would do the same. Say "Subhana l-lah", "Al hamdu li l-lah" and"Allahu Akbar" thirty three times each after every (compulsory) prayer." We differed and some of ussaid that we should say, "Subhan-al-lah" thirty three times and "Al hamdu li l-lah" thirty three timesand "Allahu Akbar" thirty four times. I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) who said, "Say, "Subhan-al-lah" and "Alhamdu li l-lah" and "Allahu Akbar" all together [??], thirty three times."

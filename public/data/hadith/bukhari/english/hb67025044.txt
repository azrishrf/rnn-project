67 | 25 | 44 | Narrated Um Habiba: I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Do you like to have (my sister) the daughter of Abu Sufyan?" The Prophet (ﷺ)said, "What shall I do (with her)?" I said, "Marry her." He said, "Do you like that?" I said, "(Yes), foreven now I am not your only wife, so I like that my sister should share you with me." He said, "She isnot lawful for me (to marry)." I said, "We have heard that you want to marry." He said, "The daughterof Um Salama?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Even if she were not my stepdaughter, she should beunlawful for me to marry, for Thuwaiba suckled me and her father (Abu Salama). So you shouldneither present your daughters, nor your sisters, to me."

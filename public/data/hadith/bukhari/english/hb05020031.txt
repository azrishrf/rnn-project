5 | 20 | 31 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'The (people of) Bani Israel used to take bath naked (all together) looking at eachother. The Prophet (ﷺ) Moses used to take a bath alone. They said, 'By Allah! Nothing prevents Mosesfrom taking a bath with us except that he has a scrotal hernia.' So once Moses went out to take a bathand put his clothes over a stone and then that stone ran away with his clothes. Moses followed thatstone saying, "My clothes, O stone! My clothes, O stone! till the people of Bani Israel saw him andsaid, 'By Allah, Moses has got no defect in his body. Moses took his clothes and began to beat thestone." Abu Huraira added, "By Allah! There are still six or seven marks present on the stone fromthat excessive beating."

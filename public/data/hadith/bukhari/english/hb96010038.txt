96 | 10 | 38 | Narrated Humaid: I heard Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan delivering a sermon. He said, "I heard the Prophet (ï·º) saying, "If Allahwants to do a favor to somebody, He bestows on him, the gift of understanding the Qur'an and Sunna.I am but a distributor, and Allah is the Giver. The state of this nation will remain good till the Hour isestablished, or till Allah's Order comes."

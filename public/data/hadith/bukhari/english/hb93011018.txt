93 | 11 | 18 | Narrated Thabit Al-Bunani: Anas bin Malik said to a woman of his family, "Do you know such-and-such a woman?" She replied,"Yes." He said, "The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by her while she was weeping over a grave, and he said to her,'Be afraid of Allah and be patient.' The woman said (to the Prophet). 'Go away from me, for you donot know my calamity.'" Anas added, "The Prophet (ﷺ) left her and proceeded. A man passed by her andasked her, 'What has Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to you?' She replied, 'I did not recognize him.' The man said,'He was Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)."' Anas added, "So that woman came to the gate of the Prophet (ﷺ) and she didnot find a gate-keeper there, and she said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah. I did not recognize you!' TheProphet said, 'No doubt, patience is at the first stroke of a calamity.'"

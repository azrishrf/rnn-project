47 | 3 | 6 | Narrated 'Abaya bin Rafa'a bin Raft' bin Khadij: My grandfather said, "We were in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) at Dhul-Hulaifa. The people felthungry and captured some camels and sheep (as booty). The Prophet (ﷺ) was behind the people. Theyhurried and slaughtered the animals and put their meat in pots and started cooking it. (When theProphet came) he ordered the pots to be upset and then he distributed the animals (of the booty),regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel. One of the camels fled and the people ran after it till theywere exhausted. At that time there were few horses. A man threw an arrow at the camel, and Allahstopped the camel with it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Some of these animals are like wild animals, so if youlose control over one of these animals, treat it in this way (i.e. shoot it with an arrow)." Beforedistributing them among the soldiers my grandfather said, "We may meet the enemies in the futureand have no knives; can we slaughter the animals with reeds?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Use whatevercauses blood to flow, and eat the animals if the name of Allah has been mentioned on slaughteringthem. Do not slaughter with teeth or fingernails and I will tell you why: It is because teeth are bones(i.e. cannot cut properly) and fingernails are the tools used by the Ethiopians (whom we should notimitate for they are infidels).

86 | 40 | 69 | Narrated Al-Mughira: Sa`d bin Ubada said, "If I found a man with my wife, I would kill him with the sharp side of mysword." When the Prophet (ï·º) heard that he said, "Do you wonder at Sa`d's sense of ghira (self-respect)?Verily, I have more sense of ghira than Sa`d, and Allah has more sense of ghira than I."

I joined him and stood on his left side but he drew meto his right and prayed thirteen rak`at and then slept till I heard his breath sounds. And whenever heslept, he used to breathe with audible sounds. The Mu'adh-dhin came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he went outand prayed the morning prayer) without repeating the ablution.

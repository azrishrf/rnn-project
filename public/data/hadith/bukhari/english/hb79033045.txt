79 | 33 | 45 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) married Zainab bint Jahsh, he invited the people who took their meals and thenremained sitting and talking. The Prophet (ﷺ) pretended to be ready to get up, but the people did not getup. When he noticed that, he got up, and when he had got up, some of those people got up along withhim and there remained three (who kept on sitting). Then the Prophet (ﷺ) came back and found thosepeople still sitting. Later on those people got up and went away. So I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) andinformed him that they had left.The Prophet (ﷺ) came, and entered (his house). I wanted to enter(along with him) but he dropped a curtainbetween me and him. Allah then revealed: 'O you who believe! Do not enter the Prophet's Housesuntil leave is given... (to His statement)... Verily! That shall be an enormity, in Allah's sight.' (33.53)

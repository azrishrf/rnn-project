50 | 3 | 4 | Narrated Aisha: Buraira came (to `Aisha) and said, "I have made a contract of emancipation with my masters for nineUqiyas (of gold) to be paid in yearly installments. Therefore, I seek your help." `Aisha said, "If yourmasters agree, I will pay them the sum at once and free you on condition that your Wala' will be forme." Buraira went to her masters but they refused that offer. She (came back) and said, "I presented tothem the offer but they refused, unless the Wala' was for them." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard of that andasked me about it, and I told him about it. On that he said, "Buy and manumit her and stipulate thatthe Wala' should be for you, as Wala' is for the liberator." `Aisha added, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then got upamongst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah, and said, 'Then after: What about some people whoimpose conditions which are not present in Allah's Laws? So, any condition which is not present inAllah's Laws is invalid even if they were one-hundred conditions. Allah's ordinance is the truth, andAllah's condition is stronger and more solid. Why do some men from you say, O so-and-so! manumitthe slave but the Wala will be for me? Verily, the Wala is for the liberator."

Abu Bakr said to `Umar, "Youintended only to oppose me." `Umar said, "I did not intend to oppose you!" Then their voices grewlouder in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) whereupon there was revealed: 'O you who believe! Do not raise yourvoices above the voice of the Prophet..a great reward.' (49.2-3) Ibn Az-Zubair said, 'Thence forwardwhen `Umar talked to the Prophet, he would talk like one who whispered a secret and would even failto make the Prophet (ﷺ) hear him, in which case the Prophet (ﷺ) would ask him (to repeat his words).

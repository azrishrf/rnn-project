19 | 5 | 9 | Narrated `Ali bin Abi Talib: One night Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me and Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked, "Won't youpray (at night)?" I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Our souls are in the hands of Allah and if He wants us toget up He will make us get up." When I said that, he left us without saying anything and I heard thathe was hitting his thigh and saying, "But man is more quarrelsome than anything." (18.54)

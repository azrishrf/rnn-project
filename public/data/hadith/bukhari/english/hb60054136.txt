60 | 54 | 136 | Narrated `Aisha: The people of Quraish worried about the lady from Bani Makhzum who had committed theft. Theyasked, "Who will intercede for her with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" Some said, "No one dare to do so exceptUsama bin Zaid the beloved one to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ." When Usama spoke about that to Allah'sApostle Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, (to him), "Do you try to intercede for somebody in a case connectedwith Allah's Prescribed Punishments?" Then he got up and delivered a sermon saying, "Whatdestroyed the nations preceding you, was that if a noble amongst them stole, they would forgive him,and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would inflict Allah's Legal punishment on him. ByAllah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I would cut off her hand."

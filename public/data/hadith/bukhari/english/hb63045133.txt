Some of us passed away without taking anything of their rewards (inthis world) and one of them was Mus`ab bin `Umar who was martyred on the day (of the battle) ofUhud leaving a striped woolen cloak. When we covered his head with it, his feet became naked, andwhen covered his feet, his head became naked.So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to cover his head and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a special kind of grass) onhis feet. (On the other hand) some of us have had their fruits ripened (in this world) and they arecollecting them."

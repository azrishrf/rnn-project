24 | 10 | 24 | Narrated Aisha: A lady along with her two daughters came to me asking (for some alms), but she found nothing withme except one date which I gave to her and she divided it between her two daughters, and did not eatanything herself, and then she got up and went away. Then the Prophet (ï·º) came in and I informed himabout this story. He said, "Whoever is put to trial by these daughters and he treats them generously(with benevolence) then these daughters will act as a shield for him from Hell-Fire."

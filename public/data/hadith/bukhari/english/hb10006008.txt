Anas added, "Wereached Khaibar at night and in the morning when he did not hear the Adhan for the prayer, he (theProphet ) rode and I rode behind Abi Talha and my foot was touching that of the Prophet.The inhabitants of Khaibar came out with their baskets and spades and when they saw the Prophet (ﷺ)they shouted 'Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad and his army.' When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw them, hesaid, "Allahu-Akbar! Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (tofight), then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned."

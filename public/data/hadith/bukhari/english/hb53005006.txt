The bedouinsaid, "My son was a laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse withhis wife. The people told me that my son should be stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I paid a ransomof one hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the learned scholars who said,"Your son has to be lashed one-hundred lashes and has to be exiled for one year." The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"No doubt I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to goback to you, and your son will get a hundred lashes and one year exile." He then addressed somebody,"O Unais! go to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death" So, Unais went and stoned her to death.

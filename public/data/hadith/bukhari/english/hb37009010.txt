37 | 9 | 10 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar bin Al-Khattab: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Your example and the example of Jews and Christians is like the example of aman who employed some laborers to whom he said, 'Who will work for me up to midday for oneQirat each?' The Jews carried out the work for one Qirat each; and then the Christians carried out thework up to the `Asr prayer for one Qirat each; and now you Muslims are working from the `Asrprayer up to sunset for two Qirats each. The Jews and Christians got angry and said, 'We work moreand are paid less.' The employer (Allah) asked them, 'Have I usurped some of your right?' Theyreplied in the negative. He said, 'That is My Blessing, I bestow upon whomever I wish.' "

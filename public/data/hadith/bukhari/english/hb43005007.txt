43 | 5 | 7 | Narrated Hudhaifa: I heard the Prophet (ï·º) saying, "Once a man died and was asked, 'What did you use to say (or do) (in yourlife time)?' He replied, 'I was a businessman and used to give time to the rich to repay his debt and(used to) deduct part of the debt of the poor.' So he was forgiven (his sins.)" Abu Mas`ud said, "Iheard the same (Hadith) from the Prophet."

9 | 16 | 33 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Angels come to you in succession by night and day and all of them get togetherat the time of the Fajr and `Asr prayers. Those who have passed the night with you (or stayed withyou) ascend (to the Heaven) and Allah asks them, though He knows everything about you, well, "Inwhat state did you leave my slaves?" The angels reply: "When we left them they were praying andwhen we reached them, they were praying."

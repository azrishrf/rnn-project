23 | 40 | 63 | Narrated `Aisha: When the Prophet (ﷺ) got the news of the death of Ibn Haritha, Ja`far and Ibn Rawaha he sat down andlooked sad and I was looking at him through the chink of the door. A man came and told him aboutthe crying of the women of Ja`far. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered him to forbid them. The man went and cameback saying that he had told them but they did not listen to him. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Forbidthem." So again he went and came back for the third time and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah, theydid not listen to us at all." (`Aisha added): Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered him to go and put dust in theirmouths. I said, (to that man) "May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. humiliate you)! You couldneither (persuade the women to) fulfill the order of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) nor did you relieve Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)from fatigue. "

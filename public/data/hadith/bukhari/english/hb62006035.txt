62 | 6 | 35 | Narrated Abu Huraira: While we were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he said, "While I was sleeping, I saw myself in Paradise, andsuddenly I saw a woman performing ablution beside a palace. I asked, 'For whom is this palace?' Theyreplied, 'It is for `Umar.' Then I remembered `Umar's Ghira (self-respect) and went away quickly."`Umar wept and said, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! How dare I think of my ghira (self-respect) being offendedby you?

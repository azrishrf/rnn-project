4 | 51 | 76 | Narrated Suwaid bin Al-Nu`man: In the year of the conquest of Khaibar I went with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) till we reached Sahba, a place nearKhaibar, where Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered the `Asr prayer and asked for food. Nothing but saweeqwas brought. He ordered it to be moistened with water. He and all of us ate it and the Prophet (ﷺ) got upfor the evening prayer (Maghrib prayer), rinsed his mouth with water and we did the same, and hethen prayed without repeating the ablution.

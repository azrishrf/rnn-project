51 | 17 | 31 | Narrated Abu Humaid Al-Sa`idi: The Prophet (ﷺ) appointed a man from the tribe of Al-Azd, called Ibn 'Utbiyya for collecting the Zakat.When he returned he said, "This (i.e. the Zakat) is for you and this has been given to my as a present."The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Why hadn't he stayed in his father's or mother's house to see whether he would begiven presents or not? By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from theresources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of Resurrection; if it bea camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a sheep, it will be bleating." TheProphet then raised his hands till we saw the whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, "O Allah!Haven't I conveyed Your Message (to them)?"

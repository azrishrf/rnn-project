23 | 84 | 130 | Narrated `Umar bin Al-Khattab: When `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul died, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) was called upon to offer his funeralprayer. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up to offer the prayer, I got up quickly and said, "O Allah'sApostle! Are you going to pray for Ibn Ubai and he said so and so on such and such occasions?" Andstarted mentioning all that he had said. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said, "O `Umar! Go away fromme." When I talked too much he said, "I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to offer theprayer). Had I known that he would be forgiven by asking for Allah's forgiveness for more thanseventy times, surely I would have done so." (`Umar added): Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered his funeralprayer and returned and after a short while the two verses of Surat Bara' were revealed: i.e. "Andnever (O Muhammad) pray for any of them who dies . . . (to the end of the verse) rebellion (9.84)" --(`Umar added), "Later I astonished at my daring before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on that day. And Allah andHis Apostle know better."

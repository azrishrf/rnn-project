91 | 26 | 34 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "When the Day of Resurrection approaches, the dreams of a believer will hardlyfail to come true, and a dream of a believer is one of forty-six parts of prophetism, and whateverbelongs to prothetism can never be false." Muhammad bin Seereen said, "But I say this." He said, "Itused to be said, 'There are three types of dreams: The reflection of one's thoughts and experiences onehas during wakefulness, what is suggested by Satan to frighten the dreamer, or glad tidings fromAllah. So, if someone has a dream which he dislikes, he should not tell it to others, but get up andoffer a prayer." He added, "He (Abu Huraira) hated to see a Ghul (i.e., iron collar around his neck in adream) and people liked to see fetters (on their feet in a dream). The fetters on the feet symbolizesone's constant and firm adherence to religion." And Abu `Abdullah said, "Ghuls (iron collars) are usedonly for necks."

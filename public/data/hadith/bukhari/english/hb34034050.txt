34 | 34 | 50 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: I was with the Prophet (ﷺ) in a Ghazwa (Military Expedition) and my camel was slow and exhausted. TheProphet came up to me and said, "O Jabir." I replied, "Yes?" He said, "What is the matter with you?" Ireplied, "My camel is slow and tired, so I am left behind." So, he got down and poked the camel withhis stick and then ordered me to ride. I rode the camel and it became so fast that I had to hold it fromgoing ahead of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . He then asked me, have you got married?" I replied in theaffirmative. He asked, "A virgin or a matron?" I replied, "I married a matron." The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Why have you not married a virgin, so that you may play with her and she may play with you?" Jabirreplied, "I have sisters (young in age) so I liked to marry a matron who could collect them all andcomb their hair and look after them." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "You will reach, so when you have arrived (athome), I advise you to associate with your wife (that you may have an intelligent son)." Then he askedme, "Would you like to sell your camel?" I replied in the affirmative and the Prophet (ﷺ) purchased it forone Uqiya of gold. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reached before me and I reached in the morning, and when I wentto the mosque, I found him at the door of the mosque. He asked me, "Have you arrived just now?" Ireplied in the affirmative. He said, "Leave your camel and come into (the mosque) and pray tworak`at." I entered and offered the prayer. He told Bilal to weigh and give me one Uqiya of gold. SoBilal weighed for me fairly and I went away. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent for me and I thought that he wouldreturn to me my camel which I hated more than anything else. But the Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, "Take yourcamel as well as its price."

He Would invoke Allah for some people by naming them: "O Allah! Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid and Salama bin Hisham and`Aiyash bin Abi Rabi`a and the weak and the helpless people among the faithful believers O Allah! Behard on the tribe of Mudar and let them suffer from famine years like that of the time of Joseph." Inthose days the Eastern section of the tribe of Mudar was against the Prophet.

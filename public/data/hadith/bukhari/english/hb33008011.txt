33 | 8 | 11 | Narrated `Ali bin Al-Husain: Safiya, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) told me that she went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to visit him in the mosquewhile he was in I`tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then shegot up in order to return home. The Prophet (ﷺ) accompanied her. When they reached the gate of themosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah'sApostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, "She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai." Both ofthem said, "Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" And they felt it. TheProphet said (to them), "Satan reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it,(everywhere in one's body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds."

34 | 64 | 100 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud: Whoever buys a sheep which has not been milked for a long time, has the option of returning it alongwith one Sa of dates; and the Prophet (ï·º) forbade going to meet the seller on the way (as he has noknowledge of the market price and he may sell his goods at a low price).

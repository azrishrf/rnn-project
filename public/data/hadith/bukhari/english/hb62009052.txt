Some Captives were brought to theProphet, she came to him but did not find him at home `Aisha was present there to whom she told (ofher desire for a servant). When the Prophet (ﷺ) came, Aisha informed him about Fatima's visit. `Ali added"So the Prophet (ﷺ) came to us, while we had gone to our bed I wanted to get up but the Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Remain at your place". Then he sat down between us till I found the coolness of his feet on my chest.Then he said, "Shall I teach you a thing which is better than what you have asked me? When you go tobed, say, 'Allahu-Akbar' thirty-four times, and 'Subhan Allah thirty-three times, and 'Al hamdu-li l-lahthirty-three times for that is better for you both than a servant."

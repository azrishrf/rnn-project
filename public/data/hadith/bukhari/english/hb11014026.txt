11 | 14 | 26 | Narrated Muhammad bin Seereen: On a rainy day Ibn `Abbas said to his Mu'adh-dhin, "After saying, 'Ash-hadu anna MuhammadanRasulullah' (I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ï·º)), do not say 'Haiya 'Alas-Salat' (come for theprayer) but say 'Pray in your houses'." (The man did so). But the people disliked it. Ibn `Abbas said,"It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ). No doubt, the Jumuaprayer is compulsory but I dislike to put you to task by bringing you out walking in mud and slush."

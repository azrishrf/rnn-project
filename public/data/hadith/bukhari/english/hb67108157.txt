67 | 108 | 157 | Narrated Aisha: That Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to her, "I know when you are pleased with me or angry with me." I said, "Whence doyou know that?" He said, "When you are pleased with me, you say, 'No, by the Lord of Muhammad,'but when you are angry with me, then you say, 'No, by the Lord of Abraham.' " Thereupon I said,"Yes (you are right), but by Allah, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I leave nothing but your name."

Would that you buy it and wear it on Fridays and when the delegates come to you!"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "This is worn by the one who will have no share in the Hereafter." Later on somesilk dresses were brought and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent one of them to `Umar. `Umar said, "How do yougive me this to wear while you said what you said about the dress of 'Utarid?"

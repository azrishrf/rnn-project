56 | 85 | 124 | Narrated Sahl: That he was asked about the wound of the Prophet (ﷺ) on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. He said, "The face of the Prophet (ﷺ) as wounded and one of his front teeth as broken and the helmet over his head was smashed. Fatima washed of the blood while `Ali held water. When she saw that bleeding was increasing continuously, she burnt a mat (of date-palm leaves) till it turned into ashes which she put over the wound and thus the bleeding ceased."

68 | 12 | 24 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The wife of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I do notblame Thabit for any defects in his character or his religion, but I am afraid that I (being a Muslim)may become unthankful for Allah's Blessings." On that, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to her), 'Will you returnhis garden to him?" She said, "Yes." So she returned his garden to him and the Prophet (ﷺ) told him todivorce her.

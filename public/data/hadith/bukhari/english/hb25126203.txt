25 | 126 | 203 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Hafsa said, "O Allah's Messenger (ï·º)! What is wrong with the people; they finished their Ihram after performing `Umra, but you have not finished it after your `Umra?" He replied, "I matted my hair and have garlanded my Hadi. So, I cannot finish my Ihram till I slaughter (my Hadi). "

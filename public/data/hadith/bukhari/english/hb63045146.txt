63 | 45 | 146 | Narrated Khabbab: We migrated with Allah's Messenger (ï·º) seeking Allah's Countenance, so our rewards became due and surewith Allah. Some of us passed away without eating anything of their rewards in this world. One ofthese was Mus`ab bin `Umar who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud. We did not findanything to shroud his body with except a striped cloak. When we covered his head with it, his feetremained uncovered, and when we covered his feet with it, his head remained uncovered. So Allah'sApostle ordered us to cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet.And there are some amongst us whose fruits have ripened and they are collecting them (i.e. they havereceived their rewards in this world).

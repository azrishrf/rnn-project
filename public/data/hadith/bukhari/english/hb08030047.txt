8 | 30 | 47 | Narrated `Amr bin Dinar: I asked Ibn `Umar, "Can a person who has performed the Tawaf around the Ka`ba for `Umra but hasnot performed the (Sa`i) Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, have a sexual relation with his wife?" Ibn `Umarreplied "When the Prophet (ﷺ) reached Mecca he performed the Tawaf around the Ka`ba(circumambulated it seven times) and offered a two-rak`at prayer (at the place) behind the station (ofAbraham) and then performed the Tawaf (Sa`i) of Safa and Marwa, and verily in Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) youhave a good example." Then we put the same question to Jabir bin `Abdullah and he too replied, "Heshould not go near his wife (for sexual relation) till he has finished the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa."

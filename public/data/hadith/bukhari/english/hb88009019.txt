88 | 9 | 19 | Narrated `Abdullah: When the Verse:--'Those who believe and did not confuse their belief with wrong (worshipping othersbesides Allah).' (6.82) was revealed, it was hard on the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) and they said,"Who among us has not wronged (oppressed) himself?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The meaning of theVerse is not as you think, but it is as Luqman said to his son, 'O my son! Join not in worship otherswith Allah, Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great wrong indeed.'" (31.13)

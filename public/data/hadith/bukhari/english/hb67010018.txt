Behold! The rider wasthe Prophet (ﷺ) himself. He said, 'What makes you in such a hurry?" I replied, I am newly married " Hesaid, "Did you marry a virgin or a matron? I replied, "A matron." He said, "Why didn't you marry ayoung girl so that you may play with her and she with you?" When we were about to enter (Medina),the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Wait so that you may enter (Medina) at night so that the lady of unkempt hair maycomb her hair and the one whose husband has been absent may shave her pubic region.

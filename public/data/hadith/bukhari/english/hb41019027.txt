41 | 19 | 27 | Narrated Hanzla bin Qais: Rafi` bin Khadij said, "My two uncles told me that they (i.e. the companions of the Prophet) used torent the land in the lifetime of the Prophet (ﷺ) for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or for aportion of the yield stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade it." I said to Rafi`, "Whatabout renting the land for Dinars and Dirhams?" He replied, "There is no harm in renting for Dinars-Dirhams. Al-Laith said, "If those who have discernment for distinguishing what is legal from what isillegal looked into what has been forbidden concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it issurrounded with dangers."

76 | 31 | 49 | Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) that she asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about plague, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) informedher saying, "Plague was a punishment which Allah used to send on whom He wished, but Allah madeit a blessing for the believers. None (among the believers) remains patient in a land in which plaguehas broken out and considers that nothing will befall him except what Allah has ordained for him, butthat Allah will grant him a reward similar to that of a martyr."

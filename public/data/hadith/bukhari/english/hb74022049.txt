74 | 22 | 49 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "When night falls (or when it is evening), stop your children from going out, forthe devils spread out at that time. But when an hour of the night has passed, release them and close thedoors and mention Allah's Name, for Satan does not open a closed door. Tie the mouth of your waterskinand mention Allah's Name; cover your containers and utensils and mention Allah's Name. Coverthem even by placing something across it, and extinguish your lamps. "

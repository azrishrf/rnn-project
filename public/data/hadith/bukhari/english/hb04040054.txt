After he had performedablution, the remaining water was taken by the people and they started smearing their bodies with it(as a blessed thing). The Prophet (ﷺ) offered two rak`at of the Zuhr prayer and then two rak`at of the `Asrprayer while a short spear (or stick) was there (as a Sutra) in front of him.

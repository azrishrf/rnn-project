62 | 12 | 64 | Narrated `Aisha: The Prophet (ﷺ) called his daughter Fatima during his illness in which he died, and told her a secretwhereupon she wept. Then he called her again and told her a secret whereupon she laughed. When Iasked her about that, she replied, "The Prophet (ﷺ) spoke to me in secret and informed me that he woulddie in the course of the illness during which he died, so I wept. He again spoke to me in secret andinformed me that I would be the first of his family to follow him (after his death) and on that Ilaughed."

She again sent for him, swearing that he should come. The Prophet (ﷺ) got up, and so didSa`d bin 'Ubada, Mu`adh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka`b, Zaid bin Thabit and some other men. The childwas brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while his breath was disturbed in his chest (the sub-narrator thinks thatUsama added: ) as if it was a leather water-skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) startedshedding tears. Sa`d said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is this?" He replied, "It is mercy which Allah haslodged in the hearts of His slaves, and Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful(to others).

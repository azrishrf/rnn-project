37 | 11 | 12 | Narrated Abu Musa: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "The example of Muslims, Jews and Christians is like the example of a man whoemployed laborers to work for him from morning till night for specific wages. They worked tillmidday and then said, 'We do not need your money which you have fixed for us and let whatever wehave done be annulled.' The man said to them, 'Don't quit the work, but complete the rest of it andtake your full wages.' But they refused and went away. The man employed another batch after themand said to them, 'Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the wages I had fixed for the firstbatch.' So, they worked till the time of `Asr prayer. Then they said, "Let what we have done beannulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself.' The man said to them, 'Complete therest of the work, as only a little of the day remains,' but they refused. Thereafter he employed anotherbatch to work for the rest of the day and they worked for the rest of the day till the sunset, and theyreceived the wages of the two former batches. So, that was the example of those people (Muslims) andthe example of this light (guidance) which they have accepted willingly.

18 | 2 | 4 | Narrated `Abdur Rahman bin Yazid: We offered a four rak`at prayer at Mina behind Ibn `Affan . `Abdullah bin Mas`ud was informedabout it. He said sadly, "Truly to Allah we belong and truly to Him we shall return." And added, "Iprayed two rak`at with Allah's Messenger (ï·º) at Mina and similarly with Abu Bakr and with `Umar (duringtheir caliphates)." He further said, "May I be lucky enough to have two of the four rak`at accepted (byAllah)."

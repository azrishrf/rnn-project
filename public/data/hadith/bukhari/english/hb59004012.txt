59 | 4 | 12 | Narrated `Aisha: On the day of a solar eclipse, Allah's Messenger (ï·º) stood up (to offer the eclipse prayer). He recited Takbir,recited a long recitation (of Holy Verses), bowed a long bowing, and then he raised h is head saying."Allah hears him who sends his praises to Him." Then he stayed standing, recited a long recitationagain, but shorter than the former, bowed a long bowing, but shorter than the first, performed a longprostration and then performed the second rak`a in the same way as he had done the first. By the timehe had finished his prayer with Taslim, the solar eclipse had been over. Then he addressed the peoplereferring to the solar and lunar eclipses saying, "These are two signs amongst the Signs of Allah, andthey do not eclipse because of anyone's death or life. So, if you see them, hasten for the Prayer."

3 | 36 | 45 | Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika: Whenever `Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) heard anything which she did not understand, she used to ask again till she understood it completely. Aisha said: "Once the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoever will becalled to account (about his deeds on the Day of Resurrection) will surely be punished." I said, "Doesn't Allah say: "He surely will receive an easy reckoning." (84.8) The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "This means only the presentation of the accounts but whoever will be argued about his account, will certainly be ruined."

AbuBakr said, "I will accompany you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "You will accompany me."Abu Bakr then said "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have two she-camels I have prepared specially for migration,so I offer you one of them. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I have accepted it on the condition that I will pay itsprice."

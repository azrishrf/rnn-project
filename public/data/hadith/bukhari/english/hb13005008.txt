13 | 5 | 8 | Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the `Id prayer, should slaughter again."A man stood up and said, "This is the day on which one has desire for meat," and he mentionedsomething about his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet (ﷺ) I believed him. Then the same man added,"I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep." The Prophet (ﷺ) permittedhim to slaughter it as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only for him or forothers as well.

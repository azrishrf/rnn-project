34 | 49 | 73 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The congregational prayer of anyone amongst you is more than twenty (five ortwenty seven) times in reward than his prayer in the market or in his house, for if he performs ablutioncompletely and then goes to the mosque with the sole intention of performing the prayer, and nothingurges him to proceed to the mosque except the prayer, then, on every step which he takes towards themosque, he will be raised one degree or one of his sins will be forgiven. The angels will keep onasking Allah's forgiveness and blessings for everyone of you so long as he keeps sitting at his prayingplace. The angels will say, 'O Allah, bless him! O Allah, be merciful to him!' as long as he does not doHadath or a thing which gives trouble to the other." The Prophet (ﷺ) further said, "One is regarded inprayer so long as one is waiting for the prayer."

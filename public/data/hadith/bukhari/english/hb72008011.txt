72 | 8 | 11 | Narrated Adi bin Hatim: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "If you let loose your hound after a game and mention Allah's Name on sending it,and the hound catches the game and kills it, then you can eat of it. But if the hound eats of it, then youshould not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, joined otherhounds, and Allah's Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animaland kill it, you should not eat of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you havethrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark otherthan the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) inwater, then do not eat of it."

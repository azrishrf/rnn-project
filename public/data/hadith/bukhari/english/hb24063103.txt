24 | 63 | 103 | Narrated Abu Ma`bad: (the slave of Ibn `Abbas) Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said to Mu`adh when he sent him to Yemen, "You will go tothe people of the Scripture. So, when you reach there, invite them to testify that none has the right tobe worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle. And if they obey you in that, tell themthat Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in each day and night. And if they obey you in that tellthem that Allah has made it obligatory on them to pay the Zakat which will be taken from the richamong them and given to the poor among them. If they obey you in that, then avoid taking the best oftheir possessions, and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person because there is no screen betweenhis invocation and Allah."

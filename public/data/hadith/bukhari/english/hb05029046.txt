5 | 29 | 46 | Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: I asked `Uthman bin `Affan about a man who engaged in the sexual intercourse with his wife but didnot discharge. `Uthman replied, "He should perform ablution like that for the prayer after washing hisprivate parts." `Uthman added, "I heard that from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)." I asked `Ali bin Abi Talib, Az-Zubair bin Al-`Awwam, Talha bin 'Ubaidullah and Ubai bin Ka`b and they gave the same reply. (AbuAiyub said that he had heard that from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ) (This order was canceled later on so one hasto take a bath. See, Hadith No. 180).

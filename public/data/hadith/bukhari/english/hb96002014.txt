Some of them said, "Heis sleeping." The others said, "His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake." Then they said, "Hisexample is that of a man who has built a house and then offered therein a banquet and sent an inviter(messenger) to invite the people. So whoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the houseand ate of the banquet, and whoever did not accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter thehouse, nor did he eat of the banquet." Then the angels said, "Interpret this example to him so that hemay understand it." Some of them said, "He is sleeping.'' The others said, "His eyes are sleeping buthis heart is awake." And then they said, "The houses stands for Paradise and the call maker isMuhammad; and whoever obeys Muhammad, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys Muhammad,disobeys Allah.

8 | 7 | 15 | Narrated Mughira bin Shu`ba: Once I was traveling with the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said, "O Mughira! take this container of water." I took itand Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went far away till he disappeared. He answered the call of nature and was wearinga Syrian cloak. He tried to take out his hands from its sleeve but it was very tight so he took out hishands from under it. I poured water and he performed ablution like that for prayers and passed his wethands over his Khuff (socks made from thick fabric or leather) and then prayed .

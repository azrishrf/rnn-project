Remember the description of its container and the stringwith which it is tied; and if somebody comes and claims it and describes it correctly, (give it to him);otherwise, utilize it." He said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What about a lost sheep?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "It isfor you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or for the wolf." He further asked, "What about a lostcamel?" On that the face of the Prophet (ﷺ) became red (with anger) and said, "You have nothing to dowith it, as it has its feet, its water reserve and can reach places of water and drink, and eat trees."

23 | 17 | 27 | Narrated Um 'Atiyya: One of the daughters of the Prophet (ï·º) expired and he came to us and said, "Wash her with Sidr (water)for odd number of times, i.e. three, five or more, if you think it necessary, and in the last, put camphoror (some camphor on her), and when you finish, notify me." So when we finished we informed him.He gave his waist-sheet to us (to shroud her). We entwined the hair (of the deceased girl) in threebraids and made them fall at her back.

86 | 31 | 57 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: I used to teach (the Qur'an to) some people of the Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was`Abdur Rahman bin `Auf. While I was in his house at Mina, and he was with `Umar bin Al-Khattabduring `Umar's last Hajj, `Abdur-Rahman came to me and said, "Would that you had seen the manwho came today to the Chief of the Believers (`Umar), saying, 'O Chief of the Believers! What do youthink about so-and-so who says, 'If `Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-andsuchperson, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a prompt suddenaction which got established afterwards.' `Umar became angry and then said, 'Allah willing, I willstand before the people tonight and warn them against those people who want to deprive the others oftheir rights (the question of rulership).`Abdur-Rahman said, "I said, 'O Chief of the believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathersthe riff-raff and the rubble, and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to addressthe people. And I am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread yourstatement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning, and mayinterpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the place of emigration andthe place of Prophet's Traditions, and there you can come in touch with the learned and noble people,and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the learned people will understand your statement andput it in its proper place.' On that, `Umar said, 'By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the firstspeech I will deliver before the people in Medina."Ibn `Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month of Dhul-Hijja, and when it wasFriday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun had declined, and I saw Sa`id bin Zaid bin`Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee wastouching his knee, and after a short while `Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw himcoming towards us, I said to Sa`id bin Zaid bin `Amr bin Nufail "Today `Umar will say such a thingas he has never said since he was chosen as Caliph." Sa`id denied my statement with astonishment andsaid, "What thing do you expect `Umar to say the like of which he has never said before?"In the meantime, `Umar sat on the pulpit and when the callmakers for the prayer had finished theircall, `Umar stood up, and having glorified and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, "Now then, I amgoing to tell you something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps itportends my death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others whereverhis mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is unlawful forhim to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him,and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the stoning of married person (male &female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood andmemorized it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him.I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, 'By Allah, we do not find the Verseof the Rajam in Allah's Book,' and thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah hasrevealed. And the punishment of the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male & female),who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception orconfession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah's Book: 'O people! Do not claim tobe the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (unthankfulness) on your part that youclaim to be the offspring of other than your real father.' Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Do not praise meexcessively as Jesus, son of Marry was praised, but call me Allah's Slave and His Apostles.' (Opeople!) I have been informed that a speaker amongst you says, 'By Allah, if `Umar should die, I willgive the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person.' One should not deceive oneself by saying thatthe pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt, it waslike that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you who has the qualitiesof Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to anybody among you withoutconsulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the person to whom the pledge of allegiancewas given, are to be supported, lest they both should be killed.And no doubt after the death of the Prophet (ﷺ) we were informed that the Ansar disagreed with us andgathered in the shed of Bani Sa`da. `Ali and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, whilethe emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr. I said to Abu Bakr, 'Let's go to these Ansari brothers of ours.'So we set out seeking them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us andinformed us of the final decision of the Ansar, and said, 'O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Whereare you going?' We replied, 'We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.' They said to us, 'Youshouldn't go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.' I said, 'By Allah, we will go tothem.' And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa`da. Behold! There was aman sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, 'Who is that man?' They said, 'He isSa`d bin 'Ubada.' I asked, 'What is wrong with him?' They said, 'He is sick.' After we sat for a while,the Ansar's speaker said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,' and praising Allah as Hedeserved, he added, 'To proceed, we are Allah's Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army,while you, the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention ofpreventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.'When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had prepared a speech which I liked and whichI wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr, and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when Iwanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, 'Wait a while.' I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himselfgave a speech, and he was wiser and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that Iliked in my own prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After apause he said, 'O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves, but thisquestion (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs as regards descent andhome, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these two men, so take the oath ofallegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu Ubaida binal-Jarrah's hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing of what he had said except thatproposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become theruler of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-selfsuggests something I don't feel at present.'And then one of the Ansar said, 'I am the pillar on which the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubsitself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. Thereshould be one ruler from us and one from you.'Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their voices rose so that I was afraid theremight be great disagreement, so I said, 'O Abu Bakr! Hold your hand out.' He held his hand out and Ipledged allegiance to him, and then all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did theAnsar afterwards. And so we became victorious over Sa`d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted tomake a ruler). One of the Ansar said, 'You have killed Sa`d bin Ubada.' I replied, 'Allah has killedSa`d bin Ubada.' `Umar added, "By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us (i.e.the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged to Abu Bakrbecause we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge of allegiance after us toone of their men, in which case we would have given them our consent for something against our realwish, or would have opposed them and caused great trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge ofallegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph) without consulting the other Muslims, then the one hehas selected should not be granted allegiance, lest both of them should be killed."

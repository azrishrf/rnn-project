10 | 107 | 173 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi Qatada: My father said, "The Prophet (ï·º) uses to recite Al-Fatiha followed by another Sura in the first two rak`atof the prayer and used to recite only Al-Fatiha in the last two rak`at of the Zuhr prayer. Sometimes averse or so was audible and he used to prolong the first rak`a more than the second and used to do thesame in the `Asr and Fajr prayers."

He swore that he would notgo to his wives for one month and he stayed in a Mashruba [??] (attic room) having stairs made ofdate palm trunks. So his companions came to visit him, and he led them in prayer sitting, whereas hiscompanions were standing. When he finished the prayer, he said, "Imam is meant to be followed, sowhen he says 'Allahu Akbar,' say 'Allahu Akbar' and when he bows, bow and when he prostrates,prostrate and if he prays standing pray, standing. After the 29th day the Prophet (ﷺ) came down (from theattic room) and the people asked him, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You swore that you will not go to yourwives for one month." He said, "The month is 29 days."

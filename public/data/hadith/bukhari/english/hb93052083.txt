93 | 52 | 83 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, I was about to order for collecting firewood and then order someone to pronounce the Adhan for the prayer and then order someone to leadthe people in prayer and then I would go from behind and burn the houses of men who did not presentthemselves for the (compulsory congregational) prayer. By Him in Whose Hands my life is, if anyoneof you had known that he would receive a bone covered with meat or two (small) pieces of meatpresent in between two ribs, he would come for `Isha' prayer."

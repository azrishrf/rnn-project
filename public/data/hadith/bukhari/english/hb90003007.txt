The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "You have to offer perfectly the five(compulsory) prayers in a day and a night (24 hrs.), except if you want to perform some extra optionalprayers." The bedouin said, "Tell me what Allah has enjoined on me as regards fasting." The Prophet (ﷺ)said, "You have to observe fast during the month of Ramadan except if you fast some extra optionalfast." The bedouin said, "Tell me what Allah has enjoined on me as regard Zakat." The Prophet (ﷺ) thentold him the Islamic laws and regulations whereupon the bedouin said, "By Him Who has honoredyou, I will not perform any optional deeds of worship and I will not leave anything of what Allah hasenjoined on me."

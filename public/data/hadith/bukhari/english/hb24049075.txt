24 | 49 | 75 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (p.b.u.h) ordered (a person) to collect Zakat, and that person returned and told himthat Ibn Jamil, Khalid bin Al-Walid, and `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib had refused to give Zakat." TheProphet said, "What made Ibn Jamil refuse to give Zakat though he was a poor man, and was madewealthy by Allah and His Apostle ? But you are unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keepinghis armor for Allah's Cause (for Jihad). As for `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib, he is the uncle of Allah'sApostle (p.b.u.h) and Zakat is compulsory on him and he should pay it double."

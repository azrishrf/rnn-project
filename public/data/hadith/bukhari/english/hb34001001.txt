34 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Abu Huraira: You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and you also wonder whythe emigrants and Ansar do not narrate from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as Abu Huraira does. My emigrantbrothers were busy in the market while I used to stick to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) content with what fills mystomach; so I used to be present when they were absent and I used to remember when they used toforget, and my Ansari brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the poor men ofSuffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to forget. No doubt, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) oncesaid, "Whoever spreads his garment till I have finished my present speech and then gathers it tohimself, will remember whatever I will say." So, I spread my colored garment which I was wearingtill Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished his saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget anyof that narrations.

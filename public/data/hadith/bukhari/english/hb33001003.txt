33 | 1 | 3 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to practice I`tikaf in the middle ten days of Ramadan and once he stayed inI`tikaf till the night of the twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to comeout of his I`tikaf. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoever was in I`tikaf with me should stay in I`tikaf for the lastten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (Inthe dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night. So, look for it inthe last ten nights and in the odd ones of them." It rained that night and the roof of the mosquedribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my own eyes the mark of mud andwater on the forehead of the Prophet (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).

78 | 106 | 212 | Narrated Jabi: A man among us begot a boy whom he named Al-Qasim. The people said, "We will not call him (i.e., the father) by that Kuniya (Abu-l-Qasim) till we ask the Prophet (ﷺ) about it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said. "Name yourselves by my name, but do not call (yourselves) by my Kuniya."

91 | 27 | 35 | Narrated Kharija bin Zaid bin Thabit: Um Al-`Ala an Ansari woman who had given the Pledge of allegiance to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said,"`Uthman bin Maz'un came in our share when the Ansars drew lots to distribute the emigrants (todwell) among themselves, He became sick and we looked after (nursed) him till he died. Then weshrouded him in his clothes. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to us, I (addressing the dead body) said, "MayAllah's Mercy be on you, O Aba As-Sa'ib! I testify that Allah has honored you." The Prophet (ﷺ) said,'How do you know that?' I replied, 'I do not know, by Allah.' He said, 'As for him, death has come tohim and I wish him all good from Allah. By Allah, though I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I neither know whatwill happen to me, nor to you.'" Um Al-`Ala said, "By Allah, I will never attest the righteousness ofanybody after that." She added, "Later I saw in a dream, a flowing spring for `Uthman. So I went toAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. He said, 'That is (the symbol of) his good deeds (thereward for) which is going on for him.' "

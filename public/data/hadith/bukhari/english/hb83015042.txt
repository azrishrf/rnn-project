83 | 15 | 42 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-As: While the Prophet (ﷺ) was delivering a sermon on the Day of Nahr (i.e., 10th Dhul-Hijja-Day ofslaughtering the sacrifice), a man got up saying, "I thought, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), such-and-such a thingwas to be done before such-and-such a thing." Another man got up, saying, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Asregards these three (acts of Hajj), thought so-and-so." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do, and there is no harm,"concerning all those matters on that day. And so, on that day, whatever question he was asked, hesaid, "Do it, do it, and there is no harm therein."

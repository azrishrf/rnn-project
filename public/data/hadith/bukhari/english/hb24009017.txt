24 | 9 | 17 | Narrated `Adi bin Hatim: While I was sitting with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) two person came to him; one of them complainedabout his poverty and the other complained about the prevalence of robberies. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said,"As regards stealing and robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan will go to Mecca(from Medina) without any guard. And regarding poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not beestablished till one of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find anybody to acceptit And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in front of Allah and there will be neither a curtain nor aninterpreter between him and Allah, and Allah will ask him, 'Did not I give you wealth?' He will replyin the affirmative. Allah will further ask, 'Didn't send a messenger to you?' And again that person willreply in the affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing but Hell-fire, and then hewill look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you should savehimself from the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if you do not find a hall datefruit,then (you can do it through saying) a good pleasant word (to your brethren).

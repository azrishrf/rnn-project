58 | 6 | 13 | Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair: that he heard Ibn `Abbas saying, "Thursday! And you know not what Thursday is? After that Ibn`Abbas wept till the stones on the ground were soaked with his tears. On that I asked Ibn `Abbas,"What is (about) Thursday?" He said, "When the condition (i.e. health) of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)deteriorated, he said, 'Bring me a bone of scapula, so that I may write something for you after whichyou will never go astray.'The people differed in their opinions although it was improper to differ infront of a prophet, They said, 'What is wrong with him? Do you think he is delirious? Ask him (tounderstand). The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, 'Leave me as I am in a better state than what you are asking me todo.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered them to do three things saying, 'Turn out all the pagans from theArabian Peninsula, show respect to all foreign delegates by giving them gifts as I used to do.' " Thesub-narrator added, "The third order was something beneficial which either Ibn `Abbas did notmention or he mentioned but I forgot.'

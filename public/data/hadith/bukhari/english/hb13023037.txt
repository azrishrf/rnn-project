13 | 23 | 37 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) offered the prayer on the day of Nahr and then delivered the Khutba and ordered thatwhoever had slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer should repeat it, that is, should slaughteranother sacrifice. Then a person from the Ansar stood up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! because of myneighbors (he described them as being very needy or poor) I slaughtered before the prayer. I have ayoung she-goat which, in my opinion, is better than two sheep." The Prophet (ﷺ) gave him the permissionfor slaughtering it as a sacrifice.

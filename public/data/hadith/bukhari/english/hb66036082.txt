66 | 36 | 82 | Narrated `Ali: I heard the Prophet (ï·º) saying, "In the last days (of the world) there will appear young people with foolishthoughts and ideas. They will give good talks, but they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out of itsgame, their faith will not exceed their throats. So, wherever you find them, kill them, for there will bea reward for their killers on the Day of Resurrection."

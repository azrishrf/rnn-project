8 | 86 | 125 | Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the age of puberty.Not a day passed but the Prophet (ï·º) visited us, both in the mornings and evenings. My father Abu Bakrthought of building a mosque in the courtyard of his house and he did so. He used to pray and recitethe Qur'an in it. The pagan women and their children used to stand by him and look at him withsurprise. Abu Bakr was a Softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting the Qur'an.The chiefs of the Quraish pagans became afraid of that (i.e. that their children and women might beaffected by the recitation of Qur'an).

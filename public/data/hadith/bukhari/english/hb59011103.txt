59 | 11 | 103 | Narrated Sulaiman bin Surd: While I was sitting in the company of the Prophet, two men abused each other and the face of one ofthem became red with anger, and his jugular veins swelled (i.e. he became furious). On that theProphet said, "I know a word, the saying of which will cause him to relax, if he does say it. If he says:'I seek Refuge with Allah from Satan.' then all is anger will go away." Some body said to him, "TheProphet has said, 'Seek refuge with Allah from Satan."' The angry man said, "Am I mad?"

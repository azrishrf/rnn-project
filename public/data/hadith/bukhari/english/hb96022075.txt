Allow him to come in." He was called in and`Umar said to him, "What made you do what you did." He replied, "We have been instructed thus bythe Prophet" `Umar said, "Bring proof (witness) for this, other wise I will do so-and-so to you." Then`Abdullah bin Qais went to a gathering of the Ansar who then said, "None but the youngest of us willgive the witness for it." So Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri got up and said, "We used to be instructed thus (bythe Prophet)." `Umar said, "This tradition of the Prophet (ï·º) remained hidden from me. Business in themarket kept me busy."

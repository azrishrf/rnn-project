He replied, "This revelation was revealedconcerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) andthe lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I have never thought that yourailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?" I replied in thenegative.

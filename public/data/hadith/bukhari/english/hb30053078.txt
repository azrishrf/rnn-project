30 | 53 | 78 | Narrated Anas: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) used to leave fasting in a certain month till we thought that he would not fast in thatmonth, and he used to fast in another month till we thought he would not stop fasting at all in thatmonth. And if one wanted to see him praying at night, one could see him (in that condition), and ifone wanted to see him sleeping at night, one could see him (in that condition) too.

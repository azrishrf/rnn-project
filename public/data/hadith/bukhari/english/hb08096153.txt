8 | 96 | 153 | Narrated Nafi`: `Abdullah bin `Umar said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) entered the Ka`ba along with Usama bin Zaid, Bilal and`Uthman bin Talha Al-Hajabi and closed the door and stayed there for some time. I asked Bilal whenhe came out, 'What did the Prophet (ﷺ) do?' He replied, 'He offered prayer with one pillar to his left andone to his right and three behind.' In those days the Ka`ba was supported by six pillars." Malik said:"There were two pillars on his (the Prophet's) right side."

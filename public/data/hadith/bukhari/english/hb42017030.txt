42 | 17 | 30 | Narrated Zaid bin Thabit: Narrated 'Abdullah (ra) said, I heard the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) say "If somebody buys date-palms after they have been pollinated, the fruits will belong to the seller unless the buyer stipulates the contrary. If somebody buys a slave having some property, the property will belong to the seller unless the buyer stipulate that it should belong to him."

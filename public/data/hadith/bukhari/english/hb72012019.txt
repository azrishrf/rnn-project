72 | 12 | 19 | Narrated Jabir: The Prophet (ï·º) sent us as an army unit of three hundred warriors under the command of Abu 'Ubaida toambush a caravan of the Quraish. But we were struck with such severe hunger that we ate the Khabt(desert bushes), so our army was called the Army of the Khabt. Then the sea threw a huge fish calledAl-`Anbar and we ate of it for half a month and rubbed our bodies with its fat till our bodies becamehealthy. Then Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs and fixed it over the ground and a rider passedunderneath it. There was a man amongst us who slaughtered three camels when hunger becamesevere, and he slaughtered three more, but after that Abu 'Ubaida forbade him to do so.

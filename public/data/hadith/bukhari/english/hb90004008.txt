90 | 4 | 8 | Narrated 'Abdullah: Nafi narrated to me that 'Abdullah said that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) forbadethe Shighar. I asked Nafi', "What is the Shighar?" He said, "It is tomarry the daughter of a man and marry one's daughter to that man (atthe same time) without Mahr (in both cases); or to marry the sister ofa man and marry one's own sister to that man without Mahr." Somepeople said, "If one, by a trick, marries on the basis of Shighar, themarriage is valid but its condition is illegal." The same scholar saidregarding Al-Mut'a, "The marriage is invalid and its condition isillegal." Some others said, "The Mut'a and the Shighar are permissiblebut the condition is illegal."

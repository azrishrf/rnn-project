67 | 46 | 79 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: "When Hafsa became a widow," `Umar said, "I met Abu Bakr and said to him, 'If you wish I willmarry Hafsa bint `Umar to you.' I waited for a few days then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked for her hand. LaterAbu Bakr met me and said, 'Nothing stopped me from returning to you concerning your offer exceptthat I knew that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had mentioned (his wish to marry) her, and I could never let out thesecret of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . If he had left her, I would have accepted her.' "

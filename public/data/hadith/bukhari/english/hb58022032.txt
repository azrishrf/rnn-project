58 | 22 | 32 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said on the day of the conquest of Mecca, "There is no migration now, but there isJihad (i.e.. holy battle) and good intentions. And when you are called for Jihad, you should come outat once" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also said, on the day of the conquest of Mecca, "Allah has made this town asanctuary since the day He created the Heavens and the Earth. So, it is a sanctuary by Allah's Decreetill the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was not legal for anyone before me, and it was made legalfor me only for an hour by daytime. So, it (i.e. Mecca) is a sanctuary by Allah's Decree till the Day ofResurrection. Its thorny bushes should not be cut, and its game should not be chased, its fallenproperty (i.e. Luqata) should not be picked up except by one who will announce it publicly; and itsgrass should not be uprooted," On that Al-`Abbas said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Except the Idhkhir,because it is used by the goldsmiths and by the people for their houses." On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Except the Idhkhir."

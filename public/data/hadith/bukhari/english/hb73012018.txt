73 | 12 | 18 | Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the `Id prayer, should repeat it (slaughteranother one)." A man said "This is the day on which meat is desired." Then he mentioned the need ofhis neighbors (for meat) and the Prophet (ﷺ) seemed to accept his excuse. The man said, "I have a Jadha'awhich is to me better than two sheep." The Prophet (ﷺ) allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But Ido not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not. The Prophet (ﷺ) then wenttowards two rams and slaughtered them, and the people went towards their sheep and slaughteredthem.

9 | 11 | 20 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came out as the sun declined at midday and offered the Zuhr prayer. He then stood onthe pulpit and spoke about the Hour (Day of Judgment) and said that in it there would be tremendousthings. He then said, "Whoever likes to ask me about anything he can do so and I shall reply as long asI am at this place of mine. Most of the people wept and the Prophet (ﷺ) said repeatedly, "Ask me."`Abdullah bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi stood up and said, "Who is my father?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Yourfather is Hudhafa." The Prophet (ﷺ) repeatedly said, "Ask me." Then `Umar knelt before him and said,"We are pleased with Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion, and Muhammad as our Prophet." TheProphet then became quiet and said, "Paradise and Hell-fire were displayed in front of me on this walljust now and I have never seen a better thing (than the former) and a worse thing (than the latter).

68 | 30 | 58 | Narrated Ibn Juraij: Ibn Shihab informed me of Lian and the tradition related to it, referring to the narration of Sahl binSa`d, the brother of Bani Sa`idi He said, "An Ansari man came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, 'O Allah'sApostle! If a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him, or what should he do?' So Allahrevealed concerning his affair what is mentioned in the Holy Qur'an about the affair of those involvedin a case of Lian. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Allah has given His verdict regarding you and your wife.' So theycarried out Lian in the mosque while I was present there. When they had finished, the man said, "OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! If I should now keep her with me as a wife then I have told a lie about her. Then hedivorced her thrice before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered him, when they had finished the Lian process. Sohe divorced her in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) ." Ibn Shihab added, "After their case, it became a tradition thata couple involved in a case of Lian should be separated by divorce. That lady was pregnant then, andlater on her son was called by his mother's name. The tradition concerning their inheritance was thatshe would be his heir and he would inherit of her property the share Allah had prescribed for him."Ibn Shihab said that Sahl bin Sa`d As'Saidi said that the Prophet (ﷺ) said (in the above narration), "If thatlady delivers a small red child like a lizard, then the lady has spoken the truth and the man was a liar,but if she delivers a child with black eyes and huge lips, then her husband has spoken the truth." Thenshe delivered it in the shape one would dislike (as it proved her guilty).

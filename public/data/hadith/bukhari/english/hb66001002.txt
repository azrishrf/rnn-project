66 | 1 | 2 | Narrated Abu `Uthman: I was informed that Gabriel came to the Prophet (ﷺ) while Um Salama was with him. Gabriel startedtalking (to the Prophet). Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked Um Salama, "Who is this?" She replied, "He is Dihya(al-Kalbi)." When Gabriel had left, Um Salama said, "By Allah, I did not take him for anybody otherthan him (i.e. Dihya) till I heard the sermon of the Prophet (ﷺ) wherein he informed about the news ofGabriel."

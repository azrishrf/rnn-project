When everything was finished and he hadspent all that was in his hand, he said to them, '"(Know) that if I have any wealth, I will not withhold itfrom you (to keep for somebody else); And (know) that he who refrains from begging others (or doingprohibited deeds), Allah will make him contented and not in need of others; and he who remainspatient, Allah will bestow patience upon him, and he who is satisfied with what he has, Allah willmake him self-sufficient. And there is no gift better and vast (you may be given) than patience."

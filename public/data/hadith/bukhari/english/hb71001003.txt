71 | 1 | 3 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, thechild died. When Abu Talha returned home, he asked, "How does my sonfare?" Um Salaim (his wife) replied, "He is quieter than he has everbeen." Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper andslept with her. When he had finished, she said (to him), "Bury thechild (as he's dead)." Next morning Abu Talha came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)and told him about that. The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Did you sleepwith your wife last night?" Abu Talha said, "Yes". The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night oftheirs." Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take careof the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took thechild to the Prophet (ﷺ) and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with thechild. The Prophet (ﷺ) took the child (on his lap) and asked if there wassomething with him. The people replied, "Yes, a few dates." TheProphet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, putit into the child's mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and namedhim 'Abdullah.

81 | 51 | 137 | Narrated `Abdullah: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I know the person who will be the last to come out of the (Hell) Fire, and the last toenter Paradise. He will be a man who will come out of the (Hell) Fire crawling, and Allah will say tohim, 'Go and enter Paradise.' He will go to it, but he will imagine that it had been filled, and then hewill return and say, 'O Lord, I have found it full.' Allah will say, 'Go and enter Paradise, and you willhave what equals the world and ten times as much (or, you will have as much as ten times the like ofthe world).' On that, the man will say, 'Do you mock at me (or laugh at me) though You are theKing?" I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (while saying that) smiling that his premolar teeth became visible. It issaid that will be the lowest in degree amongst the people of Paradise.

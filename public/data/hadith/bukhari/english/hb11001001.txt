11 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (p.b.u.h) saying, "We (Muslims) are the last (to come) but (will be) theforemost on the Day of Resurrection though the former nations were given the Holy Scriptures beforeus. And this was their day (Friday) the celebration of which was made compulsory for them but theydiffered about it. So Allah gave us the guidance for it (Friday) and all the other people are behind us inthis respect: the Jews' (holy day is) tomorrow (i.e. Saturday) and the Christians' (is) the day aftertomorrow (i.e. Sunday)."

(The king) was told that Abraham had entered (the village) accompanied by awoman who was one of the most charming women. So, the king sent for Abraham and asked, 'OAbraham! Who is this lady accompanying you?' Abraham replied, 'She is my sister (i.e. in religion).'Then Abraham returned to her and said, 'Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed themthat you are my sister. By Allah, there are no true believers on this land except you and 1.' ThenAbraham sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, prayedand said, 'O Allah! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle, and have saved my private parts fromeverybody except my husband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.' On that the king fellin a mood of agitation and started moving his legs. Seeing the condition of the king, Sarah said, 'OAllah! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.' The king regained his power, andproceeded towards her but she got up again and performed ablution, prayed and said, 'O Allah! If Ihave believed in You and Your Apostle and have kept my private parts safe from all except myhusband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.' The king again fell in a mood of agitationand started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sarah said, 'O Allah! If he should die, thepeople will say that I have killed him.' The king got either two or three attacks, and after recoveringfrom the last attack he said, 'By Allah! You have sent a satan to me. Take her to Abraham and give herAjar.' So she came back to Abraham and said, 'Allah humiliated the pagan and gave us a slave-girl forservice."

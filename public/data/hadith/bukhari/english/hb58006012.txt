He said to them, "If you embrace Islam, you will be safe. You shouldknow that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I want to expel you from this land. So, ifanyone amongst you owns some property, he is permitted to sell it, otherwise you should know thatthe Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle."

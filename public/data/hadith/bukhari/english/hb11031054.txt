11 | 31 | 54 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "When it is a Friday, the angels stand at the gate of the mosque and keep on writingthe names of the persons coming to the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The exampleof the one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one offering a camel (in sacrifice). Theone coming next is like one offering a cow and then a ram and then a chicken and then an eggrespectively. When the Imam comes out (for Jumua prayer) they (i.e. angels) fold their papers andlisten to the Khutba."

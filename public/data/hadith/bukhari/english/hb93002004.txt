He stood up, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, said, "To proceed, I havecome to know that some of you men are narrating things which are neither in Allah's Book, nor hasbeen mentioned by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . Such people are the ignorant among you. Beware of such vaindesires that mislead those who have them. I have heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'This matter (of thecaliphate) will remain with the Quraish, and none will rebel against them, but Allah will throw himdown on his face as long as they stick to the rules and regulations of the religion (Islam).'"

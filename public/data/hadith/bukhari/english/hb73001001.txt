73 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Al-Bara: The Prophet (ﷺ) said (on the day of Idal-Adha), "The first thing we will do on this day of ours, is to offerthe (`Id) prayer and then return to slaughter the sacrifice. Whoever does so, he acted according to ourSunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the prayer, what he offered was justmeat he presented to his family, and that will not be considered as Nusak (sacrifice)." (On hearingthat) Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, and said, "Ihave got a six month old ram." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not besufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you). Al-Bara' added: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoeverslaughtered (the sacrifice) after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the traditionof the Muslims."

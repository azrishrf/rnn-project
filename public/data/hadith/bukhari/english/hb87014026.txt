87 | 14 | 26 | Narrated `Aisha: We poured medicine into the mouth of the Prophet (ï·º) during his ailment. He said, "Don't pour medicineinto my mouth." (We thought he said that) out of the aversion a patient usually has for medicines.When he improved and felt better he said, "There is none of you but will be forced to drink medicine,except Al-`Abbas, for he did not witness your deed."

A man said (to the Prophet) "Please marryher to me." The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Give her a garment." The man said, "I cannot afford it." TheProphet said, "Give her anything, even if it were an iron ring." The man apologized again. TheProphet then asked him, "What do you know by heart of the Qur'an?" He replied, "I know such-andsuchportion of the Qur'an (by heart)." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Then I marry her to you for that much of theQur'an which you know by heart."

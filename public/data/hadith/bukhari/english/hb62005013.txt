62 | 5 | 13 | Narrated `Aisha: We went out with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida or Dhatul-Jaishwhere my necklace got broken (and lost). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stopped to search for it and the people toostopped with him. There was no water at that place and they had no water with them. So they went toAbu Bakr and said, "Don't you see what `Aisha has done? She has made Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and thepeople stop where there is no water and they have no water with them. Abu Bakr came while Allah'sApostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh and said, "You detained Allah Apostle and the peoplewhere there is no water and they have no water." He then admonished me and said what Allah wishedand pinched me at my flanks with his hands, but I did not move because the head of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)was on my thigh .Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on sleeping till be got up in the morning and found no water. Then Allah revealedthe Divine Verse of Tayammum, and the people performed Tayammum. Usaid bin AlHudair said. "Ofamily of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessings of yours." We urged the camel on which I wassitting to get up from its place and the necklace was found under it.

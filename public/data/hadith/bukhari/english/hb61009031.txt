61 | 9 | 31 | Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab: Al-Bahira was an animal whose milk was spared for the idols and other dieties, and so nobody wasallowed to milk it. As-Saiba was an animal which they (i.e infidels) used to set free in the names oftheir gods so that it would not be used for carrying anything. Abu Huraira said, "The Prophet (ï·º) said, 'Isaw `Amr bin 'Amir bin Luhai Al-Khuza`i dragging his intestines in the (Hell) Fire, for he was thefirst man who started the custom of releasing animals (for the sake of false gods).'

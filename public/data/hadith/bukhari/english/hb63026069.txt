The people said, "She has intended to performHajj without speaking." He said to her, "Speak, for it is illegal not to speak, as it is an action of thepre-islamic period of ignorance. So she spoke and said, "Who are you?" He said, "A man from theEmigrants." She asked, "Which Emigrants?" He replied, "From Quraish." She asked, "From whatbranch of Quraish are you?" He said, "You ask too many questions; I am Abu Bakr." She said, "Howlong shall we enjoy this good order (i.e. Islamic religion) which Allah has brought after the period ofignorance?" He said, "You will enjoy it as long as your Imams keep on abiding by its rules andregulations." She asked, "What are the Imams?" He said, "Were there not heads and chiefs of yournation who used to order the people and they used to obey them?" She said, "Yes." He said, "So they(i.e. the Imams) are those whom I meant."

Sa`d was a rich man, so he said to `Abdur-Rahman, "Iwill give you half of my property and will help you marry." `Abdur-Rahman said (to him), "MayAllah bless you in your family and property. Show me the market." So `Abdur-Rahman did not returnfrom the market) till he gained some dried buttermilk (yogurt) and butter (through trading). Hebrought that to his house-hold. We stayed for sometime (or as long as Allah wished), and then`Abdur-Rahman came, scented with yellowish perfume. The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him) "What is this?" Hereplied, "I got married to an Ansari woman." The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, "What did you pay her?" He replied,"A gold stone or gold equal to the weight of a date stone." The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Give a weddingbanquet even if with one sheep."

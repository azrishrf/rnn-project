Onthis, the people praised him. `Umar said, "People are of two kinds: Either one who is keen to take overthe Caliphate or one who is afraid of assuming such a responsibility. I wish I could be free from itsresponsibility in that I would receive neither reward nor retribution I won't bear the burden of thecaliphate in my death as I do in my life."

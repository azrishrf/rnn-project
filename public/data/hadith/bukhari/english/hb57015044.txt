57 | 15 | 44 | Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakim and Miswar bin Makhrama: When the Hawazin delegation came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after they had embraced Islam and requestedhim to return their properties and war prisoners to them, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "To me the best talk isthe truest, so you may choose either of two things; the war prisoners or the wealth, for I have delayedtheir distribution." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had waited for them for over ten days when he returned from Ta'if.So, when those people came to know that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was not going to return to them except oneof the two things the said, "We choose our war Prisoners 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up amongst theMuslims, and after glorifying Allah as He deserved, he said, "Now then, these brothers of yours havecome to us with repentance, and I see it logical that I should return their captives to them, so whoeverof you likes to do that as a favor then he can do it, and whoever amongst you likes to stick to hisshare, let him give up his prisoners and we will compensate him from the very first Fai' (i.e. war bootyreceived without fight) which Allah will give us." On that, all the people said. 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s Wehave agreed willingly to do so (return the captives)" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them "I do not knowwho amongst you has agreed to this and who has not. You should return and let your leaders informme of your agreement." The people returned and their leaders spoke to them, and then came to Allah'sApostle and said, "All the people have agreed willingly to do so and have given the permission toreturn the war prisoners (without Compensation)" (Az-Zuhri, the sub-narrator states) This is what hasbeen related to us about the captives of Hawazin.

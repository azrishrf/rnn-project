The people asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Whatabout the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the hides; and people use it forlights?" He said, "No, it is illegal." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) further said, "May Allah curse the Jews, for Allahmade the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the fat and sold it and ate its price."

60 | 1 | 9 | Narrated Anas: When `Abdullah bin Salam heard the arrival of the Prophet (ﷺ) at Medina, he came to him and said, "I amgoing to ask you about three things which nobody knows except a prophet: What is the first portent ofthe Hour? What will be the first meal taken by the people of Paradise? Why does a child resemble itsfather, and why does it resemble its maternal uncle" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Gabriel has just now toldme of their answers." `Abdullah said, "He (i.e. Gabriel), from amongst all the angels, is the enemy ofthe Jews." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The first portent of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together thepeople from the east to the west; the first meal of the people of Paradise will be Extra-lobe (caudatelobe) of fish-liver. As for the resemblance of the child to its parents: If a man has sexual intercoursewith his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman getsdischarge first, the child will resemble her." On that `Abdullah bin Salam said, "I testify that you arethe Messenger of Allah." `Abdullah bin Salam further said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The Jews are liars, and ifthey should come to know about my conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they wouldtell a lie about me." The Jews came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and `Abdullah went inside the house. Allah'sApostle asked (the Jews), "What kind of man is `Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?" They replied,"He is the most learned person amongst us, and the best amongst us, and the son of the best amongstus." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "What do you think if he embraces Islam (will you do as he does)?" TheJews said, "May Allah save him from it." Then `Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying,"I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle ofAllah." Thereupon they said, "He is the evilest among us, and the son of the evilest amongst us," andcontinued talking badly of him.

68 | 12 | 25 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The wife of Thabit bin Qais came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I do not blame Thabitfor defects in his character or his religion, but I, being a Muslim, dislike to behave in un-Islamicmanner (if I remain with him)." On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to her), "Will you give back the gardenwhich your husband has given you (as Mahr)?" She said, "Yes." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to Thabit, "OThabit! Accept your garden, and divorce her once."

95 | 1 | 10 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: I used to offer drinks prepared from infused dates to Abu Talha Al-Ansari, Abu 'Ubada bin Al Jarrahand Ubai bin Ka`b. Then a person came to them and said, "All alcoholic drinks have been prohibited."Abii Talha then said, "O Anas! Get up and break all these jars." So I got up and took a mortarbelonging to us, and hit the jars with its lower part till they broke.

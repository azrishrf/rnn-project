75 | 14 | 23 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) entered upon sick man to pay him a visit, and said to him, "Don't worry, Allah willing,(your sickness will be) an expiation for your sins." The man said, "No, it is but a fever that is boilingwithin an old man and will send him to his grave." On that, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Then yes, it is so."

Later I went toZainab bint Jahsh when her brother died; she asked for some scent, and after using it she said, "I amnot in need of scent but I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, 'It is not legal for a woman who believes inAllah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days for any dead person except her husband,(for whom she should mourn) for four months and ten days.'

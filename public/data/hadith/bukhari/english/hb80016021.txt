80 | 16 | 21 | Narrated Hudhaifa: Whenever the Prophet (ï·º) intended to go to bed, he would recite: "Bismika Allahumma amutu wa ahya(With Your name, O Allah, I die and I live)." And when he woke up from his sleep, he would say:"Al-hamdu lil-lahil-ladhi ahyana ba'da ma amatana; wa ilaihi an-nushur (All the Praises are for AllahWho has made us alive after He made us die (sleep) and unto Him is the Resurrection).

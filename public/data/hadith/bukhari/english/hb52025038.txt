52 | 25 | 38 | Narrated Abu Wail from `Abdullah: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Whoever takes a false oath in order to grab another man's (or his brother's)property, then Allah will be angry with him when he will meet him." Then Allah confirmed this byrevealing the Divine Verse: "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's Covenantand their oaths . . . Will get painful punishment." (3.77) Al-Ash'ath met me and asked, "What did`Abdullah tell you today?" I said, "So and so." He said, "The Verse was revealed regarding my case."

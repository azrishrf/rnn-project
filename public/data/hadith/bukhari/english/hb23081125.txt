23 | 81 | 125 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) once passed by two graves, and those two persons (in the graves) were being tortured. Hesaid, "They are being tortured not for a great thing (to avoid). One of them never saved himself frombeing soiled with his urine, while the other was going about with calumnies (to make enmity betweenfriends). He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on eachgrave. The people said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why have you done so?" He replied, "I hope that theirpunishment may be lessened till they (the leaf) become dry."

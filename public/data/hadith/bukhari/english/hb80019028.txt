80 | 19 | 28 | Narrated `Abdullah: The Prophet (ﷺ) divided something (among the Muslims) and distributed the shares (of the booty). A mansaid, "This division has not been made to please Allah." When I informed the Prophet (ﷺ) about it, hebecame so furious that I noticed the signs of anger on his face and he then said, "May Allah bestowHis Mercy on Moses, for he was hurt with more than this, yet he remained patient."

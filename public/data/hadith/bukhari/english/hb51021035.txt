51 | 21 | 35 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud and his creditors demanded the debt backin a harsh manner. So I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed him of that, he asked them to accept thefruits of my garden and excuse my father, but they refused. So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not give them thefruits, nor did he cut them and distribute them among them, but said, "I will come to you tomorrowmorning." So, he came to us the next morning and walked about in between the date-palms andinvoked Allah to bless their fruits. I plucked the fruits and gave back all the rights of the creditors infull, and a lot of fruits were left for us. Then I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), who was sitting, and informedhim about what happened. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told `Umar, who was sitting there, to listen to the story.`Umar said, "Don't we know that you are Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? By Allah! you are Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!"

The people of theTorah were given the Torah and they acted (upon it) till midday then they were exhausted and weregiven one Qirat (of gold) each. And then the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and theyacted (upon it) till the `Asr prayer then they were exhausted and were! given one Qirat each. And thenwe were given the Qur'an and we acted (upon it) till sunset and we were given two Qirats each. Onthat the people of both the scriptures said, 'O our Lord! You have given them two Qirats and given usone Qirat, though we have worked more than they.' Allah said, 'Have I usurped some of your right?'They said, 'No.' Allah said: "That is my blessing I bestow upon whomsoever I wish."

67 | 121 | 178 | Narrated Jabir: I was with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in a Ghazwa, and when we returned, I wanted to hurry, while riding a slowcamel. A rider came behind me. I looked back and saw that the rider was Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . He said (tome), "What makes you in such a hurry?" I replied, "I am newly married." He said, "Did you marry avirgin or a matron?" I replied, "(Not a virgin but) a matron." He said, "Why didn't you marry a younggirl with whom you could play and who could play with you?" Then when we approached (Medina)and were going to enter (it), the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Wait till you enter (your homes) at night (in the firstpart of the night) so that the ladies with unkempt hair may comb their hair, and those whose husbandshave been absent (for a long time) may shave their pubic hair." (The sub-narrator, Hashim said: Areliable narrator told me that the Prophet (ﷺ) added in this Hadith: "(Seek to beget) children! Children, OJabir!")

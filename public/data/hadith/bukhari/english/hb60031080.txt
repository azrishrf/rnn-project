60 | 31 | 80 | Narrated Abu Huraira: A Muslim and a Jew quarreled. The Muslim taking an oath, said, "By Him Who has preferredMuhammad over all people...!" The Jew said, "By Him Who has preferred Moses, over all people."The Muslim raised his hand and slapped the Jew who came to the Prophet (ﷺ) to tell him what hadhappened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Don't give me superiority over Moses, forthe people will become unconscious (on the Day of Resurrection) and I will be the first to gainconsciousness to see Moses standing and holding a side of Allah's Throne. I will not know if he hasbeen among those people who have become unconscious; and that he has gained consciousness beforeme, or he has been amongst those whom Allah has exempted."

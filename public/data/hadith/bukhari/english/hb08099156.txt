8 | 99 | 156 | Narrated `Aisha: Do you make us (women) equal to dogs and donkeys? While I used to lie in my bed, the Prophet (ï·º)would come and pray facing the middle of the bed. I used to consider it not good to stand in front ofhim in his prayers. So I used to slip away slowly and quietly from the foot of the bed till I got out ofmy guilt.

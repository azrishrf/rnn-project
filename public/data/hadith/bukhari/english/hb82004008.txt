82 | 4 | 8 | Narrated `Ali: While we were sitting with the Prophet (ﷺ) who had a stick with which he was scraping the earth, helowered his head and said, "There is none of you but has his place assigned either in the Fire or inParadise." Thereupon a man from the people said, "Shall we not depend upon this, O Allah'sApostle?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "No, but carry on and do your deeds, for everybody finds it easy to dosuch deeds (as will lead him to his place)." The Prophet (ﷺ) then recited the Verse: 'As for him who gives(in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah..' (92.5)

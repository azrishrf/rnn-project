55 | 1 | 3 | Narrated Al-Aswad: In the presence of `Aisha some people mentioned that the Prophet (ï·º) had appointed `Ali by will as hissuccessor. `Aisha said, "When did he appoint him by will? Verily when he died he was resting againstmy chest (or said: in my lap) and he asked for a wash-basin and then collapsed while in that state, andI could not even perceive that he had died, so when did he appoint him by will?"

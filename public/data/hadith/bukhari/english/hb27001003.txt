27 | 1 | 3 | Narrated Nafi`: That Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah and Salim bin `Abdullah informed him that they told Ibn `Umar whenIbn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying "There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajjthis year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Ka`ba." Ibn `Umar said "We setout with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka`ba, andso the Prophet (ﷺ) slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved." Ibn `Umar added, "I make youwitnesses that I have made `Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go and then if the wayto Ka`ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka`ba then I willdo the same as the Prophet (ﷺ) did while I was in his company." Ibn `Umar then assumed Ihram for Umrafrom Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, "The conditions of `Umra and Hajj are similarand I make you witnesses that I have made `Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself." So, he did notfinish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say,"I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. ofSafa and Marwa for both `Umra and Hajj).

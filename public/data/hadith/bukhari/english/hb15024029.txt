15 | 24 | 29 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: In the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) the people were afflicted with a (famine) year. While theProphet was delivering the Khutba (sermon) on the pulpit on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said,"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The livestock are dying and the families (offspring) are hungry: please pray toAllah to bless us with rain." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) raised both his hands towards the sky and at that timethere was not a trace of cloud in they sky. Then the clouds started gathering like mountains. Before hegot down from the pulpit I saw rainwater trickling down his beard. It rained that day, the next day, thethird day, the fourth day and till the next Friday, when the same Bedouin or some other person stoodup (during the Friday Khutba) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The houses have collapsed and thelivestock are drowned. Please invoke Allah for us." So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) raised both his hands and said,"O Allah! Around us and not on us." Whichever side the Prophet (ﷺ) directed his hand, the cloudsdispersed from there till a hole (in the clouds) was formed over Medina. The valley of Qanat remainedflowing (with water) for one month and none, came from outside who didn't talk about the abundantrain.

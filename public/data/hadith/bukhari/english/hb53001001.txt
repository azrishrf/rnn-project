53 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Anas: It was said to the Prophet (ﷺ) "Would that you see `Abdullah bin Ubai." So, the Prophet (ﷺ) went to him,riding a donkey, and the Muslims accompanied him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet (ﷺ)reached `Abdullah bin Ubai, the latter said, "Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell of yourdonkey has harmed me." On that an Ansari man said (to `Abdullah), "By Allah! The smell of thedonkey of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is better than your smell." On that a man from `Abdullah's tribe got angryfor `Abdullah's sake, and the two men abused each other which caused the friends of the two men toget angry, and the two groups started fighting with sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that thefollowing Divine Verse was revealed (in this concern):-- "And if two groups of Believers fall tofighting then, make peace between them." (49.9)

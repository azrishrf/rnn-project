10 | 84 | 133 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: I saw that whenever Allah's Messenger (ï·º) stood for the prayer, he used to raise both his hands up to theshoulders, and used to do the same on saying the Takbir for bowing and on raising his head from itand used to say, "Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah". But he did not do that (i.e. raising his hands) inprostrations.

15 | 8 | 11 | Narrated Qatada: Anas I said, "While Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) was delivering the Friday Khutba (sermon) a man cameand said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Rain is scarce; please ask Allah to bless us with rain.' So he invokedAllah for it, and it rained so much that we could hardly reach our homes and it continued raining tillthe next Friday." Anas further said, "Then the same or some other person stood up and said, 'O Allah'sApostle! Invoke Allah to withhold the rain.' On that, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I said, 'O Allah! Round about usand not on us.' " Anas added, "I saw the clouds dispersing right and left and it continued to rain butnot over Medina."

When the believing women come to you, as emigrants test them . . . for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (60.10-12) Aisha said, "When any of them agreed to that condition Allah'sApostle would say to her, 'I have accepted your pledge of allegiance.' He would only say that, but, byAllah he never touched the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while taking thepledge of allegiance and he never took their pledge of allegiance except by his words (only).

10 | 46 | 75 | Narrated `Aisha: the mother of the believers: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) in his illness said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people inprayer." I said to him, "If Abu Bakr stands in your place, the people would not hear him owing to his(excessive) weeping. So please order `Umar to lead the prayer." `Aisha added I said to Hafsa, "Say tohim: If Abu Bakr should lead the people in the prayer in your place, the people would not be able tohear him owing to his weeping; so please, order `Umar to lead the prayer." Hafsa did so but Allah'sApostle said, "Keep quiet! You are verily the Companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the peoplein the prayer. " Hafsa said to `Aisha, "I never got anything good from you."

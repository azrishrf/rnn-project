Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "This will be worn by a person who will have no share (reward)in the Hereafter." Later on similar cloaks were given to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he gave one of them to`Umar bin Al-Khattab. On that `Umar said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You have given me this cloakalthough on the cloak of Atarid (a cloak merchant who was selling that silken cloak at the gate of themosque) you passed such and such a remark."

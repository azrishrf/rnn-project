Hudhaifasaid, "I heard him saying, 'Death approached a man and when he had no hope of surviving, he said tohis family, 'When I die, gather for me much wood and build a fire (to burn me),. When the fire haseaten my flesh and reached my bones, take the bones and grind them and scatter the resulting powderin the sea on a hot (or windy) day.' (That was done.) But Allah collected his particles and asked (him),'Why did you do so?' He replied, 'For fear of You.' So Allah forgave him." Narrated `Abdu Malik:As above, saying, "On a windy day."

62 | 5 | 10 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said. "While (in a dream), I was standing by a well, drawing water from it. Abu Bakrand `Umar came to me. Abu Bakr took the bucket (from me) and drew one or two buckets of water,and there was some weakness in his drawing. May Allah forgive him. Then Ibn Al-Khattab took thebucket from Abu Bakr, and the bucket turned into a very large one in his hands. I had never seen sucha mighty person amongst the people as him in performing such hard work. He drew so much waterthat the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels." (Wahab, a sub-narrator said, "tilltheir camels drank and knelt down.")

47 | 6 | 11 | Narrated An-Nu`man bin Bashir: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "The example of the person abiding by Allah's order and restrictions in comparisonto those who violate them is like the example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat.Some of them got seats in the upper part, and the others in the lower. When the latter needed water,they had to go up to bring water (and that troubled the others), so they said, 'Let us make a hole in ourshare of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from troubling them. So, if the peoplein the upper part left the others do what they had suggested, all the people of the ship would bedestroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be safe."

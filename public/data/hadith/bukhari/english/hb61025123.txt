61 | 25 | 123 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Musailama-al-Kadhdhab (i.e. the liar) came in the life-time of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with many of his people(to Medina) and said, "If Muhammad makes me his successor, I will follow him." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)went up to him with Thabit bin Qais bin Shams; and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was carrying a piece of a datepalmleaf in his hand. He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, "If you asked meeven this piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined to, byAllah. If you reject Islam, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are most probably the same personwhom I have seen in the dream." Abu Huraira told me that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); said, "While I wassleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then Iwas instructed divinely in my dream, to blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. Iinterpreted the two bracelets as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of themwas Al-Ansi and the other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama."

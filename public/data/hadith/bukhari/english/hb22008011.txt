22 | 8 | 11 | Narrated Kuraib: I was sent to Aisha by Ibn `Abbas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and `Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar . Theytold me to greet her on their behalf and to ask her about the offering of the two rak`at after the `Asrprayer and to say to her, "We were informed that you offer those two rak`at and we were told that theProphet had forbidden offering them." Ibn `Abbas said, "I along with `Umar bin Al-Khattab used tobeat the people whenever they offered them." I went to Aisha and told her that message. `Aisha said,"Go and ask Um Salama about them." So I returned and informed them about her statement. Theythen told me to go to Um Salama with the same question with which t sent me to `Aisha. Um Salamareplied, "I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) forbidding them. Later I saw him offering them immediately after heprayed the `Asr prayer. He then entered my house at a time when some of the Ansari women from thetribe of Bani Haram were sitting with me, so I sent my slave girl to him having said to her, 'Standbeside him and tell him that Um Salama says to you, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have heard you forbiddingthe offering of these (two rak`at after the `Asr prayer) but I have seen you offering them." If he waveshis hand then wait for him.' The slave girl did that. The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned her with his hand and shewaited for him. When he had finished the prayer he said, "O daughter of Bani Umaiya! You haveasked me about the two rak`at after the `Asr prayer. The people of the tribe of `Abdul-Qais came tome and made me busy and I could not offer the two rak`at after the Zuhr prayer. These (two rak`at thatI have just prayed) are for those (missed) ones.

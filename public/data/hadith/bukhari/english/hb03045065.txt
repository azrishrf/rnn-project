What kind of fighting is in Allah's cause?(I ask this), for some of us fight because of being enraged and angry and some for the sake of his prideand haughtiness." The Prophet (ﷺ) raised his head (as the questioner was standing) and said, "He whofights so that Allah's Word (Islam) should be superior, then he fights in Allah's cause."

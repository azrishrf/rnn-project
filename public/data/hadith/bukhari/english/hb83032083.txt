83 | 32 | 83 | Narrated Ziyad bin Jubair: I was with Ibn `Umar when a man asked him, "I have vowed to fast every Tuesday or Wednesdaythroughout my life and if the day of my fasting coincided with the day of Nahr (the first day of `Id-al-Adha), (What shall I do?)" Ibn `Umar said, "Allah has ordered the vows to be fulfilled, and we areforbidden to fast on the day of Nahr." The man repeated his question and Ibn `Umar repeated hisformer answer, adding nothing more.

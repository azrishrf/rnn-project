62 | 10 | 59 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The people used to say, "Abu Huraira narrates too many narrations." In fact I used to keep close toAllah's Messenger (ï·º) and was satisfied with what filled my stomach. I ate no leavened bread and dressed nodecorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press mybelly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Qur'anic Verse to mealthough I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of allthe people to the poor was Ja`far bin Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what wasavailable therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which wewould split and lick whatever was in it.

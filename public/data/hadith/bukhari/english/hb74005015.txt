Alcoholic drink is that, that disturbs the mind." `Umar added, "I wish Allah'sApostle had not left us before he had given us definite verdicts concerning three matters, i.e., howmuch a grandfather may inherit (of his grandson), the inheritance of Al-Kalala (the deceased personamong whose heirs there is no father or son), and various types of Riba(1 ) (usury) ."

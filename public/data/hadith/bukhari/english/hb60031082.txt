60 | 31 | 82 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Angel of Death was sent to Moses when he came to Moses, Moses slapped him on the eye. Theangel returned to his Lord and said, "You have sent me to a Slave who does not want to die." Allahsaid, "Return to him and tell him to put his hand on the back of an ox and for every hair that will comeunder it, he will be granted one year of life." Moses said, "O Lord! What will happen after that?"Allah replied, "Then death." Moses said, "Let it come now." Moses then requested Allah to let him dieclose to the Sacred Land so much so that he would be at a distance of a stone's throw from it." AbuHuraira added, "Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, 'If I were there, I would show you his grave below the red sandhill on the side of the road."

52 | 28 | 42 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas: Abu Sufyan told me that Heraclius said to him, "When I inquired you what he (i.e. Muhammad)ordered you, you replied that he ordered you to establish the prayer, to speak the truth, to be chaste, tokeep promises and to pay back trusts." Then Heraclius added, "These are really the qualities of aprophet."

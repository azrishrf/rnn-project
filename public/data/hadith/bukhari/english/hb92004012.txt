Woe to the Arabs, from the Great evil that is nearly approaching them. Today agap has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog like this." (Sufyan illustrated by this forming thenumber 90 or 100 with his fingers.) It was asked, "Shall we be destroyed though there are righteouspeople among us?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Yes, if evil increased."

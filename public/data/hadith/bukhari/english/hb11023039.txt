When the Mu'adh-dhin pronounced the Adhan saying, "Allahu-Akbar, Allahu Akbar",Muawiya said: "Allah Akbar, Allahu Akbar." And when the Mu'adh-dhin said, "Ash-hadu an la ilahaillal-lah (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah)", Muawiya said, "And (so do) I".When he said, "Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah" (I testify that Muhammad is Allah'sApostle), Muawiya said, "And (so do) I". When the Adhan was finished, Muawiya said, "O people,when the Mu'adh-dhin pronounced the Adhan I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) on this very pulpit saying whatyou have just heard me saying".

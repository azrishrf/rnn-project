77 | 53 | 93 | Narrated `Abdullah: The Prophet (ﷺ) had a golden ring made for himself, and when he wore it. he used to turn its stone towardthe palm of his! hand. So the people too had gold made for themselves. The Prophet (ﷺ) then ascendedthe pulpit, and after glorifying and praising Allah, he said, "I had it made for me, but now I will neverwear it again." He threw it away, and then the people threw away their rings too. (Juwairiya, a subnarrator,said: I think Anas said that the Prophet (ﷺ) was wearing the ring in his right hand.)

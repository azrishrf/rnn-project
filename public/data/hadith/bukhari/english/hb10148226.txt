Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) looked back at us and said, 'AllahHimself is As-Salam (Peace), and if anyone of you prays then he should say, at-Tahiyatu li l-lahi wa ssalawatuwa t-taiyibat. As-salamu `alalika aiyuha n-Nabiyu wa rahmatu l-lahi wa barakatuh. Assalamu`alaina wa `ala `ibadi l-lahi s-salihin. (All the compliments, prayers and good things are due toAllah; peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and blessings [be on you]. Peace be on us an onthe pious subjects of Allah). (If you say that, it will reach all the subjects in the heaven and the earth).Ash-hadu al-la ilaha illa l-lah, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan `Abduhu wa Rasuluh. (I testify thatthere is no Deity [worthy of worship] but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and HisApostle).

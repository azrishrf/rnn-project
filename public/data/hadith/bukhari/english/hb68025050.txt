68 | 25 | 50 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Shall I tell you of the best families among the Ansar?" They (the people) said,"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The best are Banu- An-Najjar, and after them are Banu`Abdil Ash-hal, and after them are Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and after them are Banu Sa`ida."The Prophet (ﷺ) then moved his hand by closing his fingers and then opening them like one throwingsomething, and then said, "Anyhow, there is good in all the families of the Ansar.

81 | 17 | 49 | Narrated Sa`d: I was the first man among the Arabs to throw an arrow for Allah's Cause. We used to fight in Allah'sCause while we had nothing to eat except the leaves of the Hubla and the Sumur trees (desert trees) sothat we discharged excrement like that of sheep (i.e. unmixed droppings). Today the (people of the)tribe of Bani Asad teach me the laws of Islam. If so, then I am lost, and all my efforts of that hard timehad gone in vain.

13 | 3 | 4 | Narrated Aisha: Abu Bakr came to my house while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of theAnsar concerning the Day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, "Musicalinstruments of Satan in the house of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) !" It happened on the `Id day and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)said, "O Abu Bakr! There is an `Id for every nation and this is our `Id."

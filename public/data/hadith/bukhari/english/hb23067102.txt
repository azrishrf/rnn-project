23 | 67 | 102 | Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "When a human being is laid in his grave and his companions return and he evenhears their foot steps, two angels come to him and make him sit and ask him: What did you use to sayabout this man, Muhammad ? He will say: I testify that he is Allah's slave and His Apostle. Then itwill be said to him, 'Look at your place in the Hell-Fire. Allah has given you a place in Paradiseinstead of it.' " The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "The dead person will see both his places. But a non-believer or ahypocrite will say to the angels, 'I do not know, but I used to say what the people used to say! It willbe said to him, 'Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by reciting the Qur'an).' Then hewill be hit with an iron hammer between his two ears, and he will cry and that cry will be heard bywhatever approaches him except human beings and jinns."

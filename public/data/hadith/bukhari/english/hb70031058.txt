70 | 31 | 58 | Narrated Qasim bin Muhammad: Three traditions have been established because of Barira: `Aisha intended to buy her and set her free,but Barira's masters said, "Her wala' will be for us." `Aisha mentioned that to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) whosaid, "You could accept their condition if you wished, for the wala is for the one who manumits theslave." Barira was manumitted, then she was given the choice either to stay with her husband or leavehim; One day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) entered `Aisha's house while there was a cooking pot of food boiling onthe fire. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked for lunch, and he was presented with bread and some extra food from thehome-made Udm (e.g. soup). He asked, "Don't I see meat (being cooked)?" They said, "Yes, O Allah'sApostle! But it is the meat that has been given to Barira in charity and she has given it to us as apresent." He said, "For Barira it is alms, but for us it is a present."

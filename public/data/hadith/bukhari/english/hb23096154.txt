23 | 96 | 154 | Narrated `Aisha: During his sickness, Allah's Messenger (ï·º) was asking repeatedly, "Where am I today? Where will I betomorrow?" And I was waiting for the day of my turn (impatiently). Then, when my turn came, Allahtook his soul away (in my lap) between my chest and arms and he was buried in my house.

87 | 1 | 2 | Narrated `Abdullah: A man said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Which sin is the greatest in Allah's Sight?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "To setup a rival unto Allah though He Alone created you . " The man said, "What is next?" The Prophet (ﷺ)said, "To kill your son lest he should share your food with you." The man said, "What is next?" TheProphet said, "To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor." So Allahrevealed in confirmation of this narration:--'And those who invoke not with Allah, any other god. Nor kill, such life as Allah has forbidden exceptfor just cause nor commit illegal sexual intercourse. And whoever does this shall receive thepunishment.' (25.68)

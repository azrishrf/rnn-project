We made him stay with us in our house. Then he suffered from a disease which provedfatal. When he died and was given a bath and was shrouded in his clothes. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, Isaid, (addressing the dead body), 'O Aba As-Sa'ib! May Allah be Merciful to you! I testify that Allahhas honored you.' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'How do you know that Allah has honored him?" I replied, 'Letmy father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! On whom else shall Allah bestow. His honor?'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'As for him, by Allah, death has come to him. By Allah, I wish him all good(from Allah). By Allah, in spite of the fact that I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I do not know what Allah will doto me.", Um Al-`Ala added, "By Allah, I will never attest the righteousness of anybody after that."

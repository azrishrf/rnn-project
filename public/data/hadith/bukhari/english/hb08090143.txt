8 | 90 | 143 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came out on `Id day, he used to order that a Harba [??] (a short spear) to beplanted in front of him (as a Sutra for his prayer) and then he used to pray facing it with the peoplebehind him and used to do the same while on a journey. After the Prophet (ﷺ) , this practice was adoptedby the Muslim rulers (who followed his traditions).

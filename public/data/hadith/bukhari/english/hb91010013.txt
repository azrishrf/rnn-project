91 | 10 | 13 | Narrated Abu Qatada: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "A good dream is from Allah, and a bad dream is from Satan. So whoever has seen(in a dream) something he dislikes, then he should spit without saliva, thrice on his left and seek refugewith Allah from Satan, for it will not harm him, and Satan cannot appear in my shape."

34 | 24 | 38 | Narrated Samura bin Jundab: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "This night I dreamt that two men came and took me to a Holy land whence weproceeded on till we reached a river of blood, where a man was standing, and on its bank was standinganother man with stones in his hands. The man in the middle of the river tried to come out, but theother threw a stone in his mouth and forced him to go back to his original place. So, whenever he triedto come out, the other man would throw a stone in his mouth and force him to go back to his formerplace. I asked, 'Who is this?' I was told, 'The person in the river was a Riba-eater."

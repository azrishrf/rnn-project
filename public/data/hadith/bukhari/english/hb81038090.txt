81 | 38 | 90 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Allah said, 'I will declare war against him who shows hostility to a piousworshipper of Mine. And the most beloved things with which My slave comes nearer to Me, is what Ihave enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil(praying or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him, so I become his sense ofhearing with which he hears, and his sense of sight with which he sees, and his hand with which hegrips, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks Me, I will give him, and if he asks Myprotection (Refuge), I will protect him; (i.e. give him My Refuge) and I do not hesitate to do anythingas I hesitate to take the soul of the believer, for he hates death, and I hate to disappoint him."

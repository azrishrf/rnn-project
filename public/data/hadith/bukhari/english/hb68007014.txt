68 | 7 | 14 | Nafi' said: When Ibn 'Umar was asked about person who had given three divorces, he said, "Would that you gave one or two divorces, for the Prophet (ï·º) ordered me to do so. If you give three divorces then she cannot be lawful for you until she has married another husband (and is divorced by him)."

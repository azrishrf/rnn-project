67 | 15 | 26 | Narrated `Aisha: Abu Hudhaifa bin `Utba bin Rabi`a bin `Abdi Shams who had witnessed the battle of Badr along withthe Prophet (ﷺ) adopted Salim as his son, to whom he married his niece, Hind bint Al-Walid bin `Utba binRabi`a; and Salim was the freed slave of an Ansar woman, just as the Prophet (ﷺ) had adopted Zaid as hisson. It was the custom in the Pre-lslamic Period that if somebody adopted a boy, the people would callhim the son of the adoptive father and he would be the latter's heir. But when Allah revealed theDivine Verses: 'Call them by (the names of) their fathers . . . your freed-slaves,' (33.5) the adoptedpersons were called by their fathers' names. The one whose father was not known, would be regardedas a Maula and your brother in religion. Later on Sahla bint Suhail bin `Amr Al-Quraishi Al-`Amiri--and she was the wife of Abu- Hudhaifa bin `Utba--came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!We used to consider Salim as our (adopted) son, and now Allah has revealed what you know(regarding adopted sons)." The sub-narrator then mentioned the rest of the narration.

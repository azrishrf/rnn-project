37 | 15 | 16 | Narrated Khabbab: I was a blacksmith and did some work for Al-`As bin Wail. When he owed me some money for mywork, I went to him to ask for that amount. He said, "I will not pay you unless you disbelieve inMuhammad." I said, "By Allah! I will never do that till you die and be resurrected." He said, "Will Ibe dead and then resurrected after my death?" I said, "Yes." He said, "There I will have property andoffspring and then I will pay you your due." Then Allah revealed. 'Have you seen him whodisbelieved in Our signs, and yet says: I will be given property and offspring?' (19.77)

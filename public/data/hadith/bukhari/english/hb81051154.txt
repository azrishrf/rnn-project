81 | 51 | 154 | Narrated Anas: Um (the mother of) Haritha came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after Haritha had been martyred on the Day (ofthe battle) of Badr by an arrow thrown by an unknown person. She said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Youknow the position of Haritha in my heart (i.e. how dear to me he was), so if he is in Paradise, I will notweep for him, or otherwise, you will see what I will do." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Are you mad? Is thereonly one Paradise? There are many Paradises, and he is in the highest Paradise of Firdaus." TheProphet added, "A forenoon journey or an after noon journey in Allah's Cause is better than the wholeworld and whatever is in it; and a place equal to an arrow bow of anyone of you, or a place equal to afoot in Paradise is better than the whole world and whatever is in it; and if one of the women ofParadise looked at the earth, she would fill the whole space between them (the earth and the heaven)with light, and would fill whatever is in between them, with perfume, and the veil of her face is betterthan the whole world and whatever is in it."

54 | 7 | 11 | Narrated Rafi` bin Khadij: We used to work on the fields more than the other Ansar, and we used to rent the land (for the yield ofa specific portion of it). But sometimes that portion or the rest of the land did not give any yield, so wewere forbidden (by the Prophet (ï·º) ) to follow such a system, but we were allowed to rent the land formoney.

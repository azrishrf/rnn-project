54 | 15 | 20 | Narrated Az-Zuhri: `Urwa said, "Aisha told me that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to examine the womenemigrants. We have been told also that when Allah revealed the order that the Muslims should returnto the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated (after embracing Islam) and that theMuslims should not keep unbelieving women as their wives, `Umar divorced two of his wives,Qariba, the daughter of Abu Umayyah and the daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza`i. Later on Mu`awiyamarried Qariba and Abu Jahm married the other."When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Allah revealed: "And ifany of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you have an accession (by the comingover of a woman from the other side) (then pay to those whose wives have gone) the equivalent ofwhat they had spent (on their Mahr)." (60.11)So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife has gone, should be given, as a compensation of theMahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the pagans who had emigrated desertingtheir husbands.We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it. We have alsobeen told that Abu Basir bin Asid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet (ﷺ) as a Muslim emigrant during thetruce. Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet (ﷺ) requesting him to return Abu Basir.

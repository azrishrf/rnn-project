93 | 20 | 33 | Narrated Um Salama: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "I am only a human being, and you people (opponents) come to me with yourcases; and it may be that one of you can present his case eloquently in a more convincing way than theother, and I give my verdict according to what I hear. So if ever I judge (by error) and give the right ofa brother to his other (brother) then he (the latter) should not take it, for I am giving him only a pieceof Fire."

Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi said, "I remember the prayer of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) betterthan any one of you. I saw him raising both his hands up to the level of the shoulders on saying theTakbir; and on bowing he placed his hands on both knees and bent his back straight, then he stood upstraight from bowing till all the vertebrate took their normal positions. In prostrations, he placed bothhis hands on the ground with the forearms away from the ground and away from his body, and his toeswere facing the Qibla. On sitting In the second rak`a he sat on his left foot and propped up the rightone; and in the last rak`a he pushed his left foot forward and kept the other foot propped up and satover the buttocks."

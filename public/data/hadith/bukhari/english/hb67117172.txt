67 | 117 | 172 | Narrated `Aisha: My foster uncle came and asked permission (to enter) but I refused to admit him till I asked Allah'sApostle about that. He said, "He is your uncle, so allow him to come in." I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Ihave been suckled by a woman and not by a man." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "He is your uncle, so let himenter upon you." And that happened after the order of Al-Hijab (compulsory veiling) was revealed.All things which become unlawful because of blood relations are unlawful because of thecorresponding foster suckling relations.

60 | 19 | 64 | Narrated Masruq: I asked Um Ruman, `Aisha's mother about the accusation forged against `Aisha. She said, "While Iwas sitting with `Aisha, an Ansari woman came to us and said, 'Let Allah condemn such-and-suchperson.' I asked her, 'Why do you say so?' She replied, 'For he has spread the (slanderous) story.'`Aisha said, 'What story?' The woman then told her the story. `Aisha asked, 'Have Abu Bakr andAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard about it ?' She said, 'Yes.' `Aisha fell down senseless (on hearing that), andwhen she came to her senses, she got fever and shaking of the body. The Prophet (ﷺ) came and asked,'What is wrong with her?' I said, 'She has got fever because of a story which has been rumored.'`Aisha got up and said, 'By Allah! Even if I took an oath, you would not believe me, and if I putforward an excuse, You would not excuse me. My example and your example is just like that exampleof Jacob and his sons. Against that which you assert, it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.'(12.18) The Prophet (ﷺ) left and then Allah revealed the Verses (concerning the matter), and on that`Aisha said, 'Thanks to Allah (only) and not to anybody else."

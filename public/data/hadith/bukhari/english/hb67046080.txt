67 | 46 | 80 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Beware of suspicion (about others), as suspicion is the falsest talk, and do not spyupon each other, and do not listen to the evil talk of the people about others' affairs, and do not haveenmity with one another, but be brothers. And none should ask for the hand of a girl who is alreadyengaged to his (Muslim) brother, but one should wait till the first suitor marries her or leaves her."

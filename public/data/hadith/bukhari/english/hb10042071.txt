10 | 42 | 71 | Narrated Nafi`: Ibn `Umar said, "Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, 'If the supper is served for anyone of you and the Iqama ispronounced, start with the supper and don't be in haste (and carry on eating) till you finish it." If foodwas served for Ibn `Umar and Iqama was pronounced, he never came to the prayer till he finished it(i.e. food) in spite of the fact that he heard the recitation (of the Qur'an) by the Imam (in the prayer).

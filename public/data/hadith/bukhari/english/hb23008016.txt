23 | 8 | 16 | Narrated Um 'Atiyya al-Ansariya: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) came to us when his daughter died and said, "Wash her thrice or five times or more, ifyou see it necessary, with water and Sidr and then apply camphor or some camphor at the end; andwhen you finish, notify me." So when we finished it, we informed him and he gave us his waist-sheetand told us to shroud the dead body in it.

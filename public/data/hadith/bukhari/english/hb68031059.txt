68 | 31 | 59 | Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad: Ibn `Abbas; said, "Once Lian was mentioned before the Prophet (ﷺ) whereupon `Asim bin Adi saidsomething and went away. Then a man from his tribe came to him, complaining that he had found aman with his wife. `Asim said, 'I have not been put to task except for my statement (about Lian).'`Asim took the man to the Prophet (ﷺ) and the man told him of the state in which he had found his wife.The man was pale, thin, and of lank hair, while the other man whom he claimed he had seen with hiswife, was brown, fat and had much flesh on his calves. The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked, saying, 'O Allah! Revealthe truth.' So that lady delivered a child resembling the man whom her husband had mentioned he hadfound her with. The Prophet (ﷺ) then made them carry out Lian." Then a man from that gathering askedIbn `Abbas, "Was she the same lady regarding which the Prophet (ﷺ) had said, 'If I were to stone to deathsomeone without witness, I would have stoned this lady'?" Ibn `Abbas said, "No, that was anotherlady who, though being a Muslim, used to arouse suspicion by her outright misbehavior. "

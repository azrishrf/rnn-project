39 | 2 | 5 | Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair: Ibn `Abbas said, "In the verse: To every one We have appointed ' (Muwaliya Muwaliya means one's)heirs (4.33).' (And regarding the verse) 'And those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.'Ibn `Abbas said, "When the emigrants came to the Prophet (ï·º) in Medina, the emigrant would inherit theAnsari while the latter's relatives would not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which theProphet established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse: 'And toeveryone We have appointed heirs' (4.33) was revealed, it canceled (the bond (the pledge) ofbrotherhood regarding inheritance)." Then he said, "The verse: To those also to whom your righthands have pledged, remained valid regarding cooperation and mutual advice, while the matter ofinheritance was excluded and it became permissible to assign something in one's testament to theperson who had the right of inheriting before.

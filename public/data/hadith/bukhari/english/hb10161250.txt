10 | 161 | 250 | Narrated `Abdur Rahman bin `Abis: A person asked Ibn `Abbas, "Have you ever presented yourself at the (`Id) prayer with Allah'sApostle?" He replied, "Yes." And had it not been for my kinship (position) with the Prophet (ﷺ) it wouldnot have been possible for me to do so (for he was too young). The Prophet (ﷺ) went to the mark near thehouse of Kathir bin As-Salt and delivered a sermon. He then went towards the women. He advisedand reminded them and asked them to give alms. So the woman would bring her hand near her neckand take off her necklace and put it in the garment of Bilal. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) and Bilal came to thehouse."

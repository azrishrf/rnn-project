So `Aishaknew that state of his. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said, I don't know (am afraid), it may be similar to whathappened to some people referred to in the Holy Qur'an in the following Verse: -- "Then when theysaw it as a dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said, 'This is a cloud bringing us rain!' Nay,but, it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened a wind wherein is severe torment."(46.24)

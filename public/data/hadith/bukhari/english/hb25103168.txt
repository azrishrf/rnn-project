25 | 103 | 168 | Narrated Abu Huraira': Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) saw a man driving his Badana (sacrificial camel). He said, "Ride on it." The man said, "It is a Badana." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Ride on it." He (the man) said, "It is a Badana." The Prophet said, "Ride on it." And on the second or the third time he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) added, "Woe to you."

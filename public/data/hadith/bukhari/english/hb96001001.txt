96 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "There was no prophet among the prophets but was given miracles because ofwhich people had security or had belief, but what I was given was the Divine Inspiration which Allahrevealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more than those of any other prophet on the Dayof Resurrection."

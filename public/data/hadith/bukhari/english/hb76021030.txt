76 | 21 | 30 | Narrated Um Qais: I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with a a son of mine whose palate and tonsils I had pressed with myfinger as a treatment for a (throat and tonsil) disease. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Why do you pain yourchildren by pressing their throats! Use Ud Al-Hindi (certain Indian incense) for it cures sevendiseases, one of which is pleurisy. It is used as a snuff for treating throat and tonsil disease and it isinserted into one side of the mouth of one suffering from pleurisy."

11 | 5 | 7 | Narrated Abu Huraira: While `Umar (bin Al-Khattab) was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a man entered (the mosque).`Umar asked him, "What has detained you from the prayer?" The man said, "It was only that when Iheard the Adhan I performed ablution (for the prayer)." On that `Umar said, "Did you not hear theProphet saying: 'Anyone of you going out for the Jumua prayer should take a bath'?".

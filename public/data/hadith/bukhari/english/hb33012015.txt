33 | 12 | 15 | Narrated `Ali bin Al-Husain from Safiya: Safiya went to the Prophet (ﷺ) while he was in I`tikaf. When she returned, the Prophet (ﷺ) accompanied herwalking. An Ansari man saw him. When the Prophet (ﷺ) noticed him, he called him and said, "Comehere. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet (ﷺ) had said, "This is Safiya").And Satan circulates in the body of Adam's offspring as his blood circulates in it."(A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, "Did Safiya visit him at night?" He said, "Of course, at night.")

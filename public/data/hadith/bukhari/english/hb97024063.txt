97 | 24 | 63 | Narrated `Abdullah: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoever takes the property of a Muslim by taking a false oath, will meet Allah Who will be angry with him." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) recited the Verse:-- 'Verily those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter, neither will Allah speak to them, nor look at them.' (3.77)

61 | 23 | 55 | Narrated `Aisha: The Prophet (ﷺ) used to talk so clearly that if somebody wanted to count the number of his words, hecould do so. Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair: `Aisha said (to me), "Don't you wonder at Abu so-and-sowho came and sat by my dwelling and started relating the traditions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) intending to letme hear that, while I was performing an optional prayer. He left before I finished my optional prayer.Had I found him still there. I would have said to him, 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never talked so quickly andvaguely as you do.' "

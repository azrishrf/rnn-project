87 | 21 | 37 | Narrated `Aisha: We poured medicine into the mouth of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) during his illness, and he pointed out to usintending to say, "Don't pour medicine into my mouth." We thought that his refusal was out of theaversion a patient usually has for medicine. When he improved and felt a bit better he said (to us.)"Didn't I forbid you to pour medicine into my mouth?" We said, "We thought (you did so) because ofthe aversion, one usually have for medicine." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "There is none of you but will beforced to drink medicine, and I will watch you, except Al-`Abbas, for he did not witness this act ofyours."

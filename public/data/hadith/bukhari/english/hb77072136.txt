'Ubaidullah added: I said, "What is Al-Qaza'?" 'Ubaidullah pointed(towards his head) to show us and added, "Nafi` said, 'It is when a boy has his head shaved leaving atuft of hair here and a tuft of hair there." Ubaidullah pointed towards his forehead and the sides of hishead. 'Ubaidullah was asked, "Does this apply to both girls and boys?" He said, "I don't know, butNafi` said, 'The boy.'" 'Ubaidullah added, "I asked Nafi` again, and he said, 'As for leaving hair onthe temples and the back part of the boy's head, there is no harm, but Al-Qaza' is to leave a tuft of hairon his forehead unshaved while there is no hair on the rest of his head, and also to leave hair on eitherside of his head.'"

57 | 18 | 50 | Narrated Abu Qatada: We set out in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the day (of the battle) of Hunain. When we faced theenemy, the Muslims retreated and I saw a pagan throwing himself over a Muslim. I turned around andcame upon him from behind and hit him on the shoulder with the sword He (i.e. the pagan) cametowards me and seized me so violently that I felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him andhe released me. I followed `Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), "What is wrong with the people(fleeing)?" He replied, "This is the Will of Allah," After the people returned, the Prophet (ﷺ) sat and said,"Anyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will posses his spoils." I got up and said,"Who will be a witness for me?" and then sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) again said, "Anyone who has killedan enemy and has proof of that, will possess his spoils." I (again) got up and said, "Who will be awitness for me?" and sat down. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said the same for the third time. I again got up, andAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "O Abu Qatada! What is your story?" Then I narrated the whole story to him. Aman (got up and) said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed manare with me. So please compensate him on my behalf." On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, "No, byAllah, he (i.e. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of Allah's Lionswho fights on the behalf of Allah and His Apostle." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Abu Bakr has spoken thetruth." So, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave the spoils to me. I sold that armor (i.e. the spoils) and with its price Ibought a garden at Bani Salima, and this was my first property which I gained after my conversion toIslam.

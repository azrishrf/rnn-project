63 | 1 | 2 | Narrated Anas: On the day of the Conquest of Mecca, when the Prophet (ﷺ) had given (from the booty) the Quraish, theAnsar said, "By Allah, this is indeed very strange: While our swords are still dribbling with the bloodof Quraish, our war booty are distributed amongst them." When this news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) hecalled the Ansar and said, "What is this news that has reached me from you?" They used not to telllies, so they replied, "What has reached you is true." He said, "Doesn't it please you that the peopletake the booty to their homes and you take Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to your homes? If the Ansar took their waythrough a valley or a mountain pass, I would take the Ansar's valley or a mountain pass."

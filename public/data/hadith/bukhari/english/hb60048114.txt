The Prophet (ﷺ) described him saying, "He was oneof moderate height and was red-faced as if he had just come out of a bathroom. I saw Abraham whomI resembled more than any of his children did."

On that it was said to me, 'You have taken the right path (religion). Ifyou had taken the wine, your (Muslim) nation would have gone astray."

So the people kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given theflag. The next morning the people went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and every one of them hoped that he wouldbe given the flag. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Where is `Ali bin Abi Talib?" The people replied, "He issuffering from eye trouble, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)." He said, "Send for him and bring him to me." So when`Ali came, the Prophet (ﷺ) spat in his eyes and invoked good on him, and be became alright as if he hadno ailment. The Prophet (ﷺ) then gave him the flag. `Ali said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I fight them (i.e.enemy) till they become like us?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Proceed to them steadily till you approach nearto them and then invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Allah which Islamprescribes for them, for by Allah, if one man is guided on the right path (i.e. converted to Islam)through you, it would be better for you than (a great number of) red camels."

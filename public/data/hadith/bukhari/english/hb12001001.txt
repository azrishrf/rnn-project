12 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Shu'aib: I asked Az-Zuhri, "Did the Prophet (ﷺ) ever offer the Fear Prayer?" Az-Zuhri said, "I was told by Salimthat `Abdullah bin `Umar I had said, 'I took part in a holy battle with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I in Najd. Wefaced the enemy and arranged ourselves in rows. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) stood up to lead theprayer and one party stood to pray with him while the other faced the enemy. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h)and the former party bowed and performed two prostrations. Then that party left and took the place ofthose who had not prayed. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed one rak`a (with the latter) and performed twoprostrations and finished his prayer with Taslim. Then everyone of them bowed once and performedtwo prostrations individually.' "

70 | 17 | 31 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: We used to be happy on Fridays, for there was an old lady who used to pull out the roots of Silq andput it in a cooking pot with some barley. When we had finished the prayer, we would visit her and shewould present that dish before us. So we used to be happy on Fridays because of that, and we neverused to take our meals or have a mid-day nap except after the Friday prayer. By Allah, that mealcontained no fat.

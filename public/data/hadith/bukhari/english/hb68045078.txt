68 | 45 | 78 | Narrated Yunus Ibn Jubair: Ibn `Umar divorced his wife while she was having her menses. `Umar asked the Prophet (ï·º) who said,"Order him (your son) to take her back, and then divorced her before her period of the 'Iddah haselapsed." I asked Ibn `Umar, "Will that divorce (during the menses) be counted?" He replied, "Ifsomebody behaves foolishly (will his foolishness be an excuse for his misbehavior)?"

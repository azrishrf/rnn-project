51 | 23 | 40 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: A drink (of milk and water) was brought to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) while a boy was sitting on his right sideand old men were sitting on his left side. He asked the boy, "Will you allow me to give it to these(people)?" The boy said, "No, by Allah, I will not allow anyone to take my right from you." Then theProphet put the bowl in the boy's hand.

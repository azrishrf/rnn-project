11 | 25 | 41 | Narrated Az-Zuhri: I heard As-Saib bin Yazid, saying, "In the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ï·º), and Abu Bakr and `Umar, theAdhan for the Jumua prayer used to be pronounced after the Imam had taken his seat on the pulpit.But when the people increased in number during the caliphate of `Uthman, he introduced a thirdAdhan (on Friday for the Jumua prayer) and it was pronounced at Az-Zaura' and that new state ofaffairs remained so in the succeeding years.

24 | 53 | 87 | Narrated Sa`d (bin Abi Waqqas): Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) distributed something (from the resources of Zakat) amongst a group of people while Iwas sitting amongst them, but he left a man whom I considered the best of the lot. So, I went up toAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked him secretly, "Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him abeliever." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Or merely a Muslim (Who surrender to Allah)." I remained quiet for awhile but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, "O Allah'sApostle! Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer. " The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Ormerely a Muslim." I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my question because ofwhat I knew about him. I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why have you left that person? By Allah! Iconsider him a believer." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Or merely a Muslim." Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h)said, "I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that he may be thrown in the Hell-fireon his face (by reneging from Islam)."

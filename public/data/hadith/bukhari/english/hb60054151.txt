60 | 54 | 151 | Narrated Ibn Mas`ud: I heard a person reciting a (Qur'anic) Verse in a certain way, and I had heard the Prophet (ﷺ) reciting thesame Verse in a different way. So I took him to the Prophet (ﷺ) and informed him of that but I noticed thesign of disapproval on his face, and then he said, "Both of you are correct, so don't differ, for thenations before you differed, so they were destroyed."

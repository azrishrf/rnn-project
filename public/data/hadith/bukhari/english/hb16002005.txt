16 | 2 | 5 | Narrated `Aisha: In the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed, so he led the people in prayer, and stoodup and performed a long Qiyam, then bowed for a long while. He stood up again and performed along Qiyam but this time the period of standing was shorter than the first. He bowed again for a longtime but shorter than the first one, then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration. He did the same inthe second rak`a as he did in the first and then finished the prayer; by then the sun (eclipse) hadcleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) and after praising and glorifying Allah he said, "The sunand the moon are two signs against the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse on the death or life ofanyone. So when you see the eclipse, remember Allah and say Takbir, pray and give Sadaqa." TheProphet then said, "O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! There is none who has more ghaira (selfrespect)than Allah as He has forbidden that His slaves, male or female commit adultery (illegalsexual intercourse). O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! If you knew that which I know you wouldlaugh little and weep much.

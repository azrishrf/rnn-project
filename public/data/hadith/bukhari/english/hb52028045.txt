52 | 28 | 45 | Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair: A Jew from Hira asked me which one of the two periods Musa (i.e. Prophet Moses) completed. I said,"I don't know, (but wait) till I see the most learned 'Arab and inquire him about it." So, I went to Ibn`Abbas and asked him. He replied, "Moses completed the longer and better period." Ibn `Abbasadded, "No doubt, an apostle of Allah always does what he says."

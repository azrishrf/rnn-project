53 | 13 | 19 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: My father died and was in debt. I suggested that his creditors take the fruits (i.e. dates) of my gardenin lieu of the debt of my father, but they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover thefull debt. So, I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and told him about it. He said (to me), "When you pluck the datesand collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Allah's Messenger (ﷺ))." Finallyhe came accompanied by Abu Bakr and `Umar and sat on the dates and invoked Allah to bless them.Then he said, "Call your creditors and give them their full rights." So, I paid all my father's creditorsin full and yet thirteen extra Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were 'Ajwa and six were Launor six of which were Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at sunset and informed himabout it. On that he smiled and said, "Go to Abu Bakr and `Umar and tell them about it." They said,"We perceived that was going to happen, as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did what he did."

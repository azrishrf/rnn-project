59 | 7 | 46 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: that he heard the Prophet (ï·º) saying, "The Divine Inspiration was delayed for a short period but suddenly,as I was walking. I heard a voice in the sky, and when I looked up towards the sky, to my surprise, Isaw the angel who had come to me in the Hira Cave, and he was sitting on a chair in between the skyand the earth. I was so frightened by him that I fell on the ground and came to my family and said (tothem), 'Cover me! (with a blanket), cover me!' Then Allah sent the Revelation: "O, You wrapped up(In a blanket)! (Arise and warn! And your Lord magnify And keep pure your garments, And desert theidols." (74.1-5)

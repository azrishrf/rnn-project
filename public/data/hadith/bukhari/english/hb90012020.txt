90 | 12 | 20 | Narrated `Aisha: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to like sweets and also used to like honey, and whenever he finished the `Asrprayer, he used to visit his wives and stay with them. Once he visited Hafsa and remained with herlonger than the period he used to stay, so I enquired about it. It was said to me, "A woman from hertribe gave her a leather skin containing honey as a present, and she gave some of it to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)to drink." I said, "By Allah, we will play a trick on him." So I mentioned the story to Sauda (the wifeof the Prophet) and said to her, "When he enters upon you, he will come near to you whereupon youshould say to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He will say, 'No.' Then you say tohim, 'What is this bad smell? ' And it would be very hard on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) that a bad smell should befound on his body. He will say, 'Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.' Then you should say to him,'Its bees must have sucked from the Al-`Urfut (a foul smelling flower).' I too, will tell him the same.And you, O Saifya, say the same."So when the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon Sauda (the following happened). Sauda said, "By Him exceptWhom none has the right to be worshipped, I was about to say to him what you had told me to saywhile he was still at the gate because of fear from you. But when Allah 's Apostle came near to me, Isaid to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He replied, 'No.' I said, 'What about thissmell?' He said, 'Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.' I said, 'Its bees must have sucked Al-`Urfut.' "When he entered upon me, I told him the same as that, and when he entered upon Safiya, she too toldhim the same. So when he visited Hafsa again, she said to him, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I give you adrink of it (honey)?" He said, "I have no desire for it." Sauda said, Subhan Allah! We have deprivedhim of it (honey)." I said to her, "Be quiet!"

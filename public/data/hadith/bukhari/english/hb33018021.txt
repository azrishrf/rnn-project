33 | 18 | 21 | Narrated `Amra bint `Abdur-Rahman from `Aisha: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) mentioned that he would practice I`tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. `Aisha askedhis permission to perform I`tikaf and he permitted her. Hafsa asked `Aisha to take his permission forher, and she did so. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw that, she ordered a tent to be pitched for her and itwas pitched for her. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to proceed to his tent after the prayer. So, he saw the tentsans asked, "What is this?" He was told that those were the tents of Aisha, Hafsa, and Zainab. Allah'sApostle said, "Is it righteousness which they intended by doing so? I am not going to perform I`tikaf."So he returned home. When the fasting month was over, he performed Itikar for ten days in the monthof Shawwal.

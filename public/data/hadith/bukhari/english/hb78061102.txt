78 | 61 | 102 | Narrated Haritha bin Wahb: Al-Khuzai: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Shall I inform you about the people of Paradise? They comprise every obscure unimportant humble person, and if he takes Allah's Oath that he will do that thing, Allah will fulfill his oath (by doing that). Shall I inform you about the people of the Fire? They comprise every cruel, violent, proud and conceited person."

41 | 20 | 28 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Once the Prophet (ﷺ) was narrating (a story), while a bedouin was sitting with him. "One of theinhabitants of Paradise will ask Allah to allow him to cultivate the land. Allah will ask him, 'Are younot living in the pleasures you like?' He will say, 'Yes, but I like to cultivate the land.' " The Prophet (ﷺ)added, "When the man (will be permitted he) will sow the seeds and the plants will grow up and getripe, ready for reaping and so on till it will be as huge as mountains within a wink. Allah will then sayto him, 'O son of Adam! Take here you are, gather (the yield); nothing satisfies you.' " On that, thebedouin said, "The man must be either from Quraish (i.e. an emigrant) or an Ansari, for they arefarmers, whereas we are not farmers." The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled (at this).

8 | 56 | 87 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "I have been given five things which were not given to any amongst the Prophetsbefore me. These are:-1. Allah made me victorious by awe (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month'sjourney.-2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and a thing to performTayammum. Therefore my followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due.-3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me (and was not made so for anyone else).-4. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation exclusively but I have been sent to all mankind.-5. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of Resurrection.)

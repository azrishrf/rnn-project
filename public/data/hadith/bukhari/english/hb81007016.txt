By Allah, I amnow looking at my Tank-lake (Al-Kauthar) and I have been given the keys of the treasures of the earth(or the keys of the earth). By Allah! I am not afraid that after me you will worship others besidesAllah, but I am afraid that you will start competing for (the pleasures of) this world."

42 | 10 | 15 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "There are three types of people whom Allah will neither talk to, nor look at, on theDay of Resurrection. (They are):-1. A man who takes an oath falsely that he has been offered for his goods so much more than what heis given,-2. a man who takes a false oath after the `Asr prayer in order to grab a Muslim's property, and-3. a man who withholds his superfluous water. Allah will say to him, "Today I will withhold MyGrace from you as you withheld the superfluity of what you had not created."

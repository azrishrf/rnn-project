21 | 16 | 21 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: The news about the differences amongst the people of Bani `Amr bin `Auf at Quba reached Allah'sApostle and so he went to them along with some of his companions to affect a reconciliation. Allah'sApostle was delayed there and the time for the prayer became due. Bilal came to Abu Bakr! and said,"O Abu Bakr! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is detained (there) and the time for the prayer is due. Will you lead thepeople in prayer?" Abu Bakr replied, "Yes, if you wish." So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and AbuBakr went forward and the people said Takbir. In the meantime, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came piercingthrough the rows till he stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, wouldnever look hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back andsaw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned him to carry on. Abu Bakr raised both his hands, praisedAllah and retreated till he stood in the row and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went forward and led the people in theprayer. When he had finished the prayer, he addressed the people and said, "O people! Why did youstart clapping when something happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is for women. Whenever oneis confronted with something unusual in the prayer one should say, 'Sub Han Allah'." Then theProphet looked towards Abu Bakr and asked, "What prevented you from leading the prayer when Ibeckoned you to carry on?" Abu Bakr replied, "It does not befit the son of Al Quhafa to lead theprayer in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).

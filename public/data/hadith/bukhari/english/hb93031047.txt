93 | 31 | 47 | Narrated Um Salama: The Prophet (ï·º) heard the voices of some people quarreling near his gate, so he went to them and said, "Iam only a human being and litigants with cases of disputes come to me, and maybe one of thempresents his case eloquently in a more convincing and impressive way than the other, and I give myverdict in his favor thinking he is truthful. So if I give a Muslim's right to another (by mistake), thenthat (property) is a piece of Fire, which is up to him to take it or leave it." (See Hadith No. 281 )

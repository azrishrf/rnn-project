63 | 3 | 6 | Narrated Anas: When `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf came to us, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made a bond of fraternity between himand Sa`d bin Ar-Rabi` who was a rich man, Sa`d said, "The Ansar know that I am the richest of all ofthem, so I will divide my property into two parts between me and you, and I have two wives; seewhich of the two you like so that I may divorce her and you can marry her after she becomes lawful toyou by her passing the prescribed period (i.e. 'Idda) of divorce. `Abdur Rahman said, "May Allahbless you your family (i.e. wives) for you." (But `Abdur-Rahman went to the market) and did notreturn on that day except with some gain of dried yogurt and butter. He went on trading just a fewdays till he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) bearing the traces of yellow scent over his clothes. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)asked him, "What is this scent?" He replied, "I have married a woman from the Ansar." Allah'sApostle asked, "How much Mahr have you given?" He said, "A date-stone weight of gold or a goldendate-stone." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Arrange a marriage banquet even with a sheep."

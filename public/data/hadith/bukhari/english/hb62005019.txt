62 | 5 | 19 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "While a shepherd was amongst his sheep, a wolf attacked them andtook away one sheep. When the shepherd chased the wolf, the wolf turned towards him and said,'Who will be its guard on the day of wild animals when nobody except I will be its shepherd. Andwhile a man was driving a cow with a load on it, it turned towards him and spoke to him saying, 'Ihave not been created for this purpose, but for ploughing." The people said, "Glorified be Allah." TheProphet said, "But I believe in it and so does Abu Bakr end `Umar."

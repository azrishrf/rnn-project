81 | 41 | 97 | Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in good health, he used to say, "No prophet's soulis ever captured unless he is shown his place in Paradise and given the option (to die or survive)." Sowhen the death of the Prophet (ﷺ) approached and his head was on my thigh, he became unconscious for awhile and then he came to his senses and fixed his eyes on the ceiling and said, "O Allah (with) thehighest companions." (See Qur'an 4:69). I said' "Hence he is not going to choose us." And I came toknow that it was the application of the narration which he (the Prophet) used to narrate to us. And thatwas the last statement of the Prophet (before his death) i.e., "O Allah! With the highest companions."(See Qur'an 4:69)

61 | 2 | 7 | Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair: `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair was the most beloved person to `Aisha excluding the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr,and he in his turn, was the most devoted to her, `Aisha used not to withhold the money given to her byAllah, but she used to spend it in charity. (`Abdullah) bin AzZubair said, " `Aisha should be stoppedfrom doing so." (When `Aisha heard this), she said protestingly, "Shall I be stopped from doing so? Ivow that I will never talk to `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair." On that, Ibn Az-Zubair asked some peoplefrom Quraish and particularly the two uncles of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to intercede with her, but she refused(to talk to him). Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles of the Prophet, including `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin`Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama said to him, "When we ask for the permission to visither, enter her house along with us (without taking her leave)." He did accordingly (and she acceptedtheir intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not keeping) hervow. `Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted forty slaves. She said,"I wish I had specified what I would have done in case of not fulfilling my vow when I made the vow,so that I might have done it easily."

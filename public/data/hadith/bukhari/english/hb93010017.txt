93 | 10 | 17 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: While the Prophet (ﷺ) and I were coming out of the mosque, a man met us outside the gate. The man said,"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! When will be the Hour?" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, "What have you prepared forit?" The man became afraid and ashamed and then said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I haven't prepared for itmuch of fasts, prayers or charitable gifts but I love Allah and His Apostle." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Youwill be with the one whom you love."

One day he went to her house and she offeredhim a meal, and after that he slept, and then woke up smiling. She (Um Haram) said, "I asked him,'What makes you laugh, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?' He said, 'Some people of my followers were displayedbefore me as warriors fighting for Allah's Cause and sailing over this sea, kings on thrones,' or said,'like kings on thrones.' (The narrator, 'Is-haq is in doubt about it.) I (Um Haram) said, 'O Allah'sApostle! Invoke Allah that He may make me one of them.' He invoked (Allah) for her and then lay hishead and slept again and then woke up smiling. I asked, 'What makes you laugh, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?'He said, 'Some people of my followers were displayed before me as warriors fighting for Allah'sCause and sailing over this sea, kings on the thrones,' or said, 'like kings on the thrones.' I (UmHaram) said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Invoke Allah that He may make me one of them.' He said, You willbe amongst the first ones."

93 | 15 | 26 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: When the Prophet (ﷺ) intended to write to the Byzantines, the people said, "They do not read a letterunless it is sealed (stamped)." Therefore the Prophet (ﷺ) took a silver ring----as if I am looking at itsglitter now----and its engraving was: 'Muhammad, Apostle of Allah'.

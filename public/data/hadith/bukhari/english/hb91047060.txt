91 | 47 | 60 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: A man came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "I saw in a dream, a cloud having shade. Butter and honeywere dropping from it and I saw the people gathering it in their hands, some gathering much and somea little. And behold, there was a rope extending from the earth to the sky, and I saw that you (theProphet) held it and went up, and then another man held it and went up and (after that) another (third)held it and went up, and then after another (fourth) man held it, but it broke and then got connectedagain." Abu Bakr said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Let my father be sacrificed for you! Allow me to interpretthis dream." The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, "Interpret it." Abu Bakr said, "The cloud with shade symbolizesIslam, and the butter and honey dropping from it, symbolizes the Qur'an, its sweetness dropping andsome people learning much of the Qur'an and some a little. The rope which is extended from the skyto the earth is the Truth which you (the Prophet) are following. You follow it and Allah will raise youhigh with it, and then another man will follow it and will rise up with it and another person will followit and then another man will follow it but it will break and then it will be connected for him and hewill rise up with it. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Let my father be sacrificed for you! Am I right or wrong?" TheProphet replied, "You are right in some of it and wrong in some." Abu Bakr said, "O Allah's Prophet!By Allah, you must tell me in what I was wrong." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do not swear."

63 | 45 | 130 | Narrated Abu Burda Bin Abi Musa Al-Ash`ari: `Abdullah bin `Umar said to me, "Do you know what my father said to your father once?" I said,"No." He said, "My father said to your father, 'O Abu Musa, will it please you that we will berewarded for our conversion to Islam with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and our migration with him, and our Jihadwith him and all our good deeds which we did, with him, and that all the deeds we did after his deathwill be disregarded whether good or bad?' Your father (i.e. Abu Musa) said, 'No, by Allah, we tookpart in Jihad after Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , prayed and did plenty of good deeds, and many people haveembraced Islam at our hands, and no doubt, we expect rewards from Allah for these good deeds.' Onthat my father (i.e. `Umar) said, 'As for myself, By Him in Whose Hand `Umar's soul is, I wish thatthe deeds done by us at the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) remain rewardable while whatsoever we did after thedeath of the Prophet (ﷺ) be enough to save us from Punishment in that the good deeds compensate for thebad ones.' " On that I said (to Ibn `Umar), "By Allah, your father was better than my father!"

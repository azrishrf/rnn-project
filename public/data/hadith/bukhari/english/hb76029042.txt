76 | 29 | 42 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Some people from the tribes of `Ukl and `Uraina came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and embraced Islam andsaid, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We are owners of livestock and have never been farmers," and they foundthe climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered that they be given some camelsand a shepherd, and ordered them to go out with those camels and drink their milk and urine. So theyset out, but when they reached a place called Al-Harra, they reverted to disbelief after their conversionto Islam, killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) he sentin their pursuit (and they were caught and brought). The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that their eyes be brandedwith heated iron bars and their hands be cut off, and they were left at Al-Harra till they died in thatstate.

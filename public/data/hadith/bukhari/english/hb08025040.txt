8 | 25 | 40 | Narrated Ibrahim: Hammam bin Al-Harith said, "I saw Jarir bin `Abdullah urinating. Then he performed ablution andpassed his (wet) hands over his Khuffs (socks made from thick fabric or leather), stood up and prayed.He was asked about it. He replied that he had seen the Prophet (ï·º) doing the same." They approved of thisnarration as Jarir was one of those who embraced Islam very late.

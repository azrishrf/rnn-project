21 | 6 | 8 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: While Abu Bakr was leading the people in the morning prayer on aMonday, the Prophet (ﷺ) came towards them suddenly having lifted thecurtain of 'Aisha's house, and looked at them as they were standing inrows and smiled. Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah'sApostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of theMuslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted tosee the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) waved his hand to them to complete theirprayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. TheProphet expired on that very day.

68 | 28 | 56 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Hilal bin Umaiyya accused his wife of illegal sexual intercourse and came to the Prophet (ﷺ) to bearwitness (against her), (taking the oath of Lian). The Prophet (ﷺ) was saying, "Allah knows that either ofyou is a liar. Will anyone of you repent (to Allah)?" Then the lady got up and gave her witness.

The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered for the leather dining sheets to be spread, and then dates, dried yogurtand butter were provided over it, and that was the Walima (banquet) of the Prophet. The Muslimsasked whether Safiyya would be considered as his wife or as a slave girl of what his right handspossessed. Then they said, "If the Prophet (ﷺ) screens her from the people, then she Is the Prophet's wifebut if he does not screen her, then she is a slave girl."

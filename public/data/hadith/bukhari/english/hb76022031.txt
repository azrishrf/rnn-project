76 | 22 | 31 | Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet)When the health of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) deteriorated and his condition became serious, he asked thepermission of all his wives to allow him to be treated In my house, and they allowed him. He cameout, supported by two men and his legs were dragging on the ground between `Abbas and anotherman. (The sub-narrator told Ibn `Abbas who said: Do you know who was the other man whom `Aishadid not mention? The sub-narrator said: No. Ibn `Abbas said: It was `Ali.) `Aisha added: When theProphet entered my house and his disease became aggravated, he said, "Pour on me seven water skinsfull of water (the tying ribbons of which had not been untied) so that I may give some advice to thepeople." So we made him sit in a tub belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) and started pouringwater on him from those water skins till he waved us to stop. Then he went out to the people and ledthem in prayer and delivered a speech before them.

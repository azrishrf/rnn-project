You then should say to him, 'If you (`Ali) were in themouth of a lion, I would like to be with you, but in this matter I won't take any part.' " Harmala added:"`Ali didn't give me anything (when I conveyed the message to him) so I went to Hasan, Hussain andIbn Ja`far and they loaded my camels with much (wealth).

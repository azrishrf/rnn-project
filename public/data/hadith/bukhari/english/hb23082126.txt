23 | 82 | 126 | Narrated `Ali: " We were accompanying a funeral procession in Baqi-I-Gharqad. The Prophet (ﷺ) came to us and sat andwe sat around him. He had a small stick in his hand then he bent his head and started scraping theground with it. He then said, "There is none among you, and not a created soul, but has place either inParadise or in Hell assigned for him and it is also determined for him whether he will be among theblessed or wretched." A man said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Should we not depend on what has beenwritten for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessedperson and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?" TheProphet said, "The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for thewretched." Then he recited the Verses:-- "As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing Andbelieves in the Best reward from Allah. " (92.5-6)

9 | 26 | 53 | Narrated Jarir bin `Abdullah: We were with the Prophet (ﷺ) on a full moon night. He looked at the moon and said, "You will certainlysee your Lord as you see this moon, and there will be no trouble in seeing Him. So if you can avoidmissing (through sleep, business, etc.) a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr) and before its setting(`Asr) you must do so. He (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) then recited the following verse:And celebrate the praises Of Your Lord before The rising of the sun And before (its) setting." (50.39)

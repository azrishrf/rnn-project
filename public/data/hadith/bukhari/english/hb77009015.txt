77 | 9 | 15 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has set forth an example for a miser and a charitable person by comparing them to twomen wearing two iron cloaks and their hands are raised to their breasts and necks. Whenever thecharitable man tries to give a charitable gift, his iron cloak expands till it becomes so wide that it willcover his fingertips and obliterate his tracks And, whenever the miser wants to give a charitable gift,his cloak becomes very tight over him and every ring gets stuck to its place Abu Huraira added; I sawAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) putting his finger in the (chest) pocket of his shirt like that If you but saw him tryingto widen (the opening of his shirt) but it did not widen.

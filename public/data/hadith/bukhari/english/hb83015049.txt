83 | 15 | 49 | Narrated Ibn Mas`ud: that Allah's Prophet led them in the Zuhr prayer and he offered either more or less rak`at, and it wassaid to him, "O Allah's Messenger (ï·º) ! Has the prayer been reduced, or have you forgotten?" He asked,"What is that?" They said, "You have prayed so many rak`at." So he performed with them two moreprostrations and said, "These two prostrations are to be performed by the person who does not knowwhether he has prayed more or less (rak`at) in which case he should seek to follow what is right. Andthen complete the rest (of the prayer) and perform two extra prostrations."

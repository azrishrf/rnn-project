35 | 4 | 8 | Narrated Abu Al-Bakhtari: I asked Ibn `Umar about Salam for dates. Ibn `Umar replied, "The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade the sale (the fruits)of date-palms until they were fit for eating and also forbade the sale of silver for gold on credit." I alsoasked Ibn `Abbas about it. Ibn `Abbas replied, "The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade the sale of dates till they were fitfor eating, and could be weighed." I asked him, "What is to be weighed (as the dates are on thetrees)?" A man sitting by Ibn `Abbas said, "It means till they are cut and stored."

87 | 17 | 31 | Narrated Salama: We went out with the Prophet (ﷺ) to Khaibar. A man (from the companions) said, "O 'Amir! Let us hearsome of your Huda (camel-driving songs.)" So he sang some of them (i.e. a lyric in harmony with thecamels walk). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Who is the driver (of these camels)?" They said, "Amir." TheProphet said, "May Allah bestow His Mercy on him !" The people said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Wouldthat you let us enjoy his company longer!" Then 'Amir was killed the following morning. The peoplesaid, "The good deeds of 'Amir are lost as he has killed himself." I returned at the time while theywere talking about that. I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Prophet! Let my father be sacrificedfor you! The people claim that 'Amir's good deeds are lost." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoever says so is aliar, for 'Amir will have a double reward as he exerted himself to obey Allah and fought in Allah'sCause. No other way of killing would have granted him greater reward."

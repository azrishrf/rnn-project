46 | 2 | 2 | Narrated Safwan bin Muhriz Al-Mazini: While I was walking with Ibn `Umar holding his hand, a man came in front of us and asked, "Whathave you heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about An-Najwa?" Ibn `Umar said, "I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)saying, 'Allah will bring a believer near Him and shelter him with His Screen and ask him: Did youcommit such-and-such sins? He will say: Yes, my Lord. Allah will keep on asking him till he willconfess all his sins and will think that he is ruined. Allah will say: 'I did screen your sins in the worldand I forgive them for you today', and then he will be given the book of his good deeds. Regardinginfidels and hypocrites (their evil acts will be exposed publicly) and the witnesses will say: These arethe people who lied against their Lord. Behold! The Curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers." (11.18)

62 | 5 | 26 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: While I was standing amongst the people who were invoking Allah for `Umar bin Al-Khattab whowas lying (dead) on his bed, a man behind me rested his elbows on my shoulder and said, "(O `Umar!)May Allah bestow His Mercy on you. I always hoped that Allah will keep you with your twocompanions, for I often heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "I, Abu Bakr and `Umar were (somewhere). I,Abu Bakr and `Umar did (something). I, Abu Bakr and `Umar set out.' So I hoped that Allah will keepyou with both of them." I turned back to see that the speaker was `Ali bin Abi Talib.

The next Friday`Umar bin Al-Khattab recited the same Sura and when he reached the verse of Sajda he said, "Opeople! When we recite the verses of Sajda (during the sermon) whoever prostrates does the rightthing, yet it is no sin for the one who does not prostrate." And `Umar did not prostrate (that day).Added Ibn `Umar "Allah has not made the prostration of recitation compulsory but if we wish we cando it."

11 | 11 | 18 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "All of you are Guardians." Yunis said: Ruzaiq bin Hukaim wrote toIbn Shihab while I was with him at Wadi-al-Qura saying, "Shall I lead the Jumua prayer?" Ruzaiq wasworking on the land (i.e. farming) and there was a group of Sudanese people and some others withhim; Ruzaiq was then the Governor of Aila. Ibn Shihab wrote (to Ruzaiq) ordering him to lead theJumua prayer and telling him that Salim told him that `Abdullah bin `Umar had said, "I heard Allah'sApostle saying, 'All of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and the things under yourcare. The Imam (i.e. ruler) is the guardian of his subjects and is responsible for them and a man is theguardian of his family and is responsible for them. A woman is the guardian of her husband's houseand is responsible for it. A servant is the guardian of his master's belongings and is responsible forthem.' I thought that he also said, 'A man is the guardian of his father's property and is responsible forit. All of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and the things under your care."

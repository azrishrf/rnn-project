4 | 5 | 4 | Narrated Kuraib: Ibn `Abbas said, "The Prophet (ﷺ) slept till he snored and then prayed (or probably lay till his breathsounds were heard and then got up and prayed)." Ibn `Abbas added: "I stayed overnight in the houseof my aunt, Maimuna, the Prophet (ﷺ) slept for a part of the night, (See Fath-al-Bari page 249, Vol. 1),and late in the night, he got up and performed ablution from a hanging water skin, a light (perfect)ablution and stood up for the prayer. I, too, performed a similar ablution, then I went and stood on hisleft. He drew me to his right and prayed as much as Allah wished, and again lay and slept till hisbreath sounds were heard. Later on the Mu'adh-dhin (call maker for the prayer) came to him andinformed him that it was time for Prayer. The Prophet (ﷺ) went with him for the prayer withoutperforming a new ablution." (Sufyan said to `Amr that some people said, "The eyes of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)sleep but his heart does not sleep." `Amr replied, "I heard `Ubaid bin `Umar saying that the dreams ofProphets were Divine Inspiration, and then he recited the verse: 'I (Abraham) see in a dream, (O myson) that I offer you in sacrifice (to Allah)."

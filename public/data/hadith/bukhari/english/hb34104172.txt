34 | 104 | 172 | Narrated Sa`id bin Abu Al-Hasan: While I was with Ibn `Abbas a man came and said, "O father of `Abbas! My sustenance is from mymanual profession and I make these pictures." Ibn `Abbas said, "I will tell you only what I heard fromAllah's Messenger (ï·º) . I heard him saying, 'Whoever makes a picture will be punished by Allah till he putslife in it, and he will never be able to put life in it.' " Hearing this, that man heaved a sigh and his faceturned pale. Ibn `Abbas said to him, "What a pity! If you insist on making pictures I advise you tomake pictures of trees and any other unanimated objects."

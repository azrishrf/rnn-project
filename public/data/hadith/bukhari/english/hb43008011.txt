43 | 8 | 11 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud, and he was in debt. His creditorsdemanded their rights persistently. I went to the Prophet (and informed him about it). He told them totake the fruits of my garden and exempt my father from the debts but they refused to do so. So, theProphet did not give them my garden and told me that he would come to me the next morning. Hecame to us early in the morning and wandered among the date-palms and invoked Allah to bless theirfruits. I then plucked the dates and paid the creditors, and there remained some of the dates for us.

64 | 83 | 476 | Narrated Talha: I asked `Abdullah bin Abu `Aufa "Did the Prophet (ﷺ) make a will? ' He replied, "No." I further asked, "How comes it that the making of a will was enjoined on the people or that they were ordered to make it? " He said, "The Prophet (ﷺ) made a will concerning Allah's Book."

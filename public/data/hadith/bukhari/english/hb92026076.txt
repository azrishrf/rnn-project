92 | 26 | 76 | Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "No prophet was sent but that he warned his followers against the one-eyed liar(Ad-Dajjal). Beware! He is blind in one eye, and your Lord is not so, and there will be writtenbetween his (Ad-Dajjal's) eyes (the word) Kafir (i.e., disbeliever)." (This Hadith is also quoted by AbuHuraira and Ibn `Abbas).

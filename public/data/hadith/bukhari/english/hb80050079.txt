80 | 50 | 79 | Narrated Abu Musa: We were in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) on a journey, and whenever we ascended a high place, weused to say Takbir (in a loud voice). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O people! Be kind to yourselves, for you arenot calling upon a deaf or an absent one, but You are calling an All-Hearer, and an All-Seer." Then hecame to me as I was reciting silently, "La haul a wala quwwata illa bil-lah." He said, "O `Abdullah binQais! Say: La haul a walaquwata illa bil-lah, for it is one of the treasures of Paradise." Or he said,"Shall I tell you a word which is one of the treasures of Paradise? It is: La haul a wala quwwata illabil-lah."

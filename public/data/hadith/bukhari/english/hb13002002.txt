13 | 2 | 2 | Narrated Aisha: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) came to my house while two girls were singing beside me the songs of Buath(a story about the war between the two tribes of the Ansar, the Khazraj and the Aus, before Islam).The Prophet (p.b.u.h) lay down and turned his face to the other side. Then Abu Bakr came and spoketo me harshly saying, "Musical instruments of Satan near the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)(p.b.u.h) turned his face towards him and said, "Leave them." When Abu Bakr became inattentive, Isignaled to those girls to go out and they left.

67 | 32 | 55 | Narrated Thabit Al-Banani: I was with Anas while his daughter was present with him. Anas said, "A woman came to Allah'sApostle and presented herself to him, saying, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), have you any need for me (i.e. wouldyou like to marry me)?' "Thereupon Anas's daughter said, "What a shameless lady she was ! Shame!Shame!" Anas said, "She was better than you; she had a liking for the Prophet (ﷺ) so she presented herselffor marriage to him."

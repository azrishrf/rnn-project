91 | 15 | 24 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "While I was sleeping, I was given a bowl full of milk (in a dream),and I drank of it to my fill until I noticed its wetness coming out of my nails, and then I gave the restof it to `Umar." They (the people) asked, "What have you interpreted (about the dream)? O Allah'sApostle?" He said, "(It is Religious) knowledge."

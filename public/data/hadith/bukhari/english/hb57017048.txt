57 | 17 | 48 | Narrated Jubair bin Mut`im: I and `Uthman bin `Affan went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You have given toBani Al-Muttalib and left us although they and we are of the same kinship to you." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)said, "Bani Muttalib and Bani Hashim are one and the same." The Prophet (ﷺ) did not give a share to Bani`Abd Shams and Bani Naufai. (Ibn 'Is-haq said, "Abd Shams and Hashim and Al-Muttalib werematernal brothers and their mother was 'Atika bint Murra and Naufal was their paternal brother.)

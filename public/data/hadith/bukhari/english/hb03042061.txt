3 | 42 | 61 | Narrated Abu Huraira: People say that I have narrated many Hadiths (The Prophet's narration). Had it not been for two versesin the Qur'an, I would not have narrated a single Hadith, and the verses are:"Verily those who conceal the clear sign and the guidance which We have sent down . . . (up to) MostMerciful." (2:159-160). And no doubt our Muhajir (emigrant) brothers used to be busy in the marketwith their business (bargains) and our Ansari brothers used to be busy with their property(agriculture). But I (Abu Huraira) used to stick to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) contented with what will fill mystomach and I used to attend that which they used not to attend and I used to memorize that whichthey used not to memorize.

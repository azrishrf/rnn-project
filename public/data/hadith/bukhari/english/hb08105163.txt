8 | 105 | 163 | Narrated `Aisha: The things which annul prayer were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, a donkey and awoman. I said, "You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs. By Allah! I saw the Prophet (ï·º)praying while I used to lie in (my) bed between him and the Qibla. Whenever I was in need ofsomething, I disliked to sit and trouble the Prophet. So, I would slip away by the side of his feet."

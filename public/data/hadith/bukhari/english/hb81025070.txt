81 | 25 | 70 | Narrated Hudhaifa: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "There was a man amongst the people who had suspicion as to the righteousness ofhis deeds. Therefore he said to his family, 'If I die, take me and burn my corpse and throw my ashesinto the sea on a hot (or windy) day.' They did so, but Allah, collected his particles and asked (him),What made you do what you did?' He replied, 'The only thing that made me do it, was that I wasafraid of You.' So Allah forgave him."

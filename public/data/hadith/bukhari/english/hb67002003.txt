67 | 2 | 3 | Narrated 'Alqama: While I was with `Abdullah, `Uthman met him at Mina and said, "O Abu `Abdur-Rahman ! I havesomething to say to you." So both of them went aside and `Uthman said, "O Abu `Abdur-Rah. man!Shall we marry you to a virgin who will make you remember your past days?" When `Abdullah feltthat he was not in need of that, he beckoned me (to join him) saying, "O 'Alqama!"

Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, and whoever is not able to marry,is recommended to fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.

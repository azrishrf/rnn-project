72 | 14 | 23 | Narrated Salama bin Al-Aqwa': In the evening of the day of the conquest of Khaibar, the army made fires (for cooking). The Prophet (ﷺ)said, "For what have you made these fires?" They said, "For cooking the meat of domestic donkeys."He said, "Throw away what is in the cooking pots and break the pots." A man from the people got upand said, "Shall we throw the contents of the cooking pots and then wash the pots (instead of breakingthem)?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Yes, you can do either.'

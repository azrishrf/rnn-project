22 | 5 | 8 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) offered one of the evening prayers (the sub-narrator Muhammad said, "I think that it wasmost probably the `Asr prayer") and he finished it after offering two rak`at only. He then stood near aprice of wood in front of the Mosque and put his hand over it. Abu Bakr and `Umar were amongstthose who were present, but they dared not talk to him about that (because of excessive respect forhim), and those who were in a hurry went out. They said, "Has the prayer been reduced?" A man whowas called Dhul-Yadain by the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to the Prophet), "Has the prayer been reduced or haveyou forgotten?" He said, "Neither have I forgotten, nor has the prayer been reduced." He said,"Certainly you have forgotten." So the Prophet (ﷺ) offered two more rak`at and performed Taslim andthen said Takbir and performed a prostration of Sahu like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer andthen raised his head and said Takbir and then put his head down and performed a prostration like hisordinary prostration or a bit longer, and then raised his head and said Takbir.

59 | 15 | 112 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A group of Israelites were lost. Nobody knows what they did. But I do not seethem except that they were cursed and changed into rats, for if you put the milk of a she-camel in frontof a rat, it will not drink it, but if the milk of a sheep is put in front of it, it will drink it." I told this toKa`b who asked me, "Did you hear it from the Prophet (ﷺ) ?" I said, "Yes." Ka`b asked me the samequestion several times.; I said to Ka`b. "Do I read the Torah? (i.e. I tell you this from the Prophet.)"

Allow me to tell you what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saidon the day following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart understood itthoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet (ﷺ) when he, after Glorifying and Praising Allah,started saying, 'Allah, not the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allahand the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut down its trees. If anybody tells(argues) that fighting in it is permissible on the basis that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did fight in Mecca, say tohim, 'Allah allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.' "Allah allowed me only for a few hours onthat day (of the conquest) and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are presentshould inform those who are absent (concerning this fact." Abu Shuraih was asked, "What did `Amrreply?" He said, (`Amr said) 'O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you in this respect Mecca does notgive protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief."

Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) andmy mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. Shecalled me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the handand made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing becameAllright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house.There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, "Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a goodluck." Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah'sApostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was agirl of nine years of age.

93 | 29 | 45 | Narrated Um Salama: (the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Messenger (ï·º) heard some people quarreling at the door of his dwelling, sohe went out to them and said, "I am only a human being, and litigants with cases of dispute come tome, and someone of you may happen to be more eloquent (in presenting his case) than the other,whereby I may consider that he is truthful and pass a judgment in his favor. If ever I pass a judgmentin favor of somebody whereby he takes a Muslim's right unjustly, then whatever he takes is nothingbut a piece of Fire, and it is up to him to take or leave."

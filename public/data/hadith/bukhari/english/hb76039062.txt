76 | 39 | 62 | Narrated `Aisha: Whenever Allah's Messenger (ï·º) went to bed, he used to recite Surat-al-Ikhlas, Surat-al-Falaq and Surat-an-Nas and then blow on his palms and pass them over his face and those parts of his body that his handscould reach. And when he fell ill, he used to order me to do like that for him.

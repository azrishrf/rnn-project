86 | 14 | 31 | Narrated Ubada bin As-Samit: I gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet (ï·º) with a group of people, and he said, "I take your pledgethat you will not worship anything besides Allah, will not steal, will not commit infanticide, will notslander others by forging false statements and spreading it, and will not disobey me in anything good.And whoever among you fulfill all these (obligations of the pledge), his reward is with Allah. Andwhoever commits any of the above crimes and receives his legal punishment in this world, that will behis expiation and purification. But if Allah screens his sin, it will be up to Allah, Who will eitherpunish or forgive him according to His wish." Abu `Abdullah said: "If a thief repents after his handhas been cut off, the his witness well be accepted. Similarly, if any person upon whom any legalpunishment has been inflicted, repents, his witness will be accepted."

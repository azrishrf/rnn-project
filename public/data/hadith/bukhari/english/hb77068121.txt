77 | 68 | 121 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet (ï·º) was neither conspicuously tall, nor short; neither, very white, nor tawny. His hair wasneither much curled, nor very straight. Allah sent him (as an Apostle) at the age of forty (and afterthat) he stayed for ten years in Mecca, and for ten more years in Medina. Allah took him unto Him atthe age of sixty, and he scarcely had ten white hairs on his head and in his beard.

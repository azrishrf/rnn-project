4 | 34 | 46 | Narrated Zaid bin Khalid: I asked `Uthman bin `Affan about a person who engaged in intercourse but did no discharge. `Uthmanreplied, "He should perform ablution like the one for an ordinary prayer but he must wash his penis."`Uthman added, "I heard it from Allah's Messenger (ï·º)." I asked `Ali Az-Zubair, Talha and Ubai bin Ka`babout it and they, too, gave the same reply. (This order was canceled later on and taking a bathbecame necessary for such cases).

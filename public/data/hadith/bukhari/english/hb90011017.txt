90 | 11 | 17 | Narrated Abu Haraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "A lady slave should not be given in marriage until she is consulted, and a virginshould not be given in marriage until her permission is granted." The people said, "How will sheexpress her permission?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "By keeping silent (when asked her consent)." Somepeople said, "If a man, by playing a trick, presents two false witnesses before the judge to testify thathe has married a matron with her consent and the judge confirms his marriage, and the husband is surethat he has never married her (before), then such a marriage will be considered as a legal one and hemay live with her as husband."

81 | 53 | 173 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet (ï·º) said: "While I was walking in Paradise (on the night of Mi'raj), I saw a river, on the twobanks of which there were tents made of hollow pearls. I asked, "What is this, O Gabriel?' He said,'That is the Kauthar which Your Lord has given to you.' Behold! Its scent or its mud was sharpsmelling musk!" (The sub-narrator, Hudba is in doubt as to the correct expression. )

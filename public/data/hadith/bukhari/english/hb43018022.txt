43 | 18 | 22 | Narrated Jabir: When `Abdullah (my father) died, he left behind children and debts. I asked the lenders to put downsome of his debt, but they refused, so I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) to intercede with them, yet they refused.The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to me), "Classify your dates into their different kinds: 'Adha bin Zaid, Lean and'Ajwa, each kind alone and call all the creditors and wait till I come to you." I did so and the Prophet (ﷺ)came and sat beside the dates and started measuring to each his due till he paid them fully, and theamount of dates remained as it was before, as if he had not touched them.

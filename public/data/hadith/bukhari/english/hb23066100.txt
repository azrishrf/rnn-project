One day the Prophet (ﷺ) remembered him and said, "What happened to that person?"The people replied, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He died." He said, "Why did you not inform me?" They said,"His story was so and so (i.e. regarded him as insignificant)." He said, "Show me his grave." He thenwent to his grave and offered the funeral prayer.

42 | 7 | 9 | Narrated `Urwa: When a man from the Ansar quarreled with Az-Zubair, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (yourland) first and then let the water flow (to the land of the others)." "On that the Ansari said, (to theProphet), "It is because he is your aunt's son." On that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Zubair! Irrigate till thewater reaches the walls between the pits around the trees and then stop (i.e. let the water go to theother's land)." I think the following verse was revealed concerning this event: "But no, by your LordThey can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them." (4.65)

79 | 9 | 11 | Narrated Abu Aiyub: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "It is not lawful for a Muslim to desert (not to speak to) his brother Muslim for morethan three days while meeting, one turns his face to one side and the other turns his face to the otherside. Lo! The better of the two is the one who starts greeting the other."

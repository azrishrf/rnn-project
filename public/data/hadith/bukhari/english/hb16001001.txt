16 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Abu Bakra: We were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when the sun eclipsed. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up dragging his cloak tillhe entered the Mosque. He led us in a two-rak`at prayer till the sun (eclipse) had cleared. Then theProphet (p.b.u.h) said, "The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone's death. Sowhenever you see these eclipses pray and invoke (Allah) till the eclipse is over."

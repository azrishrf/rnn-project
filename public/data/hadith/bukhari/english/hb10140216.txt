10 | 140 | 216 | Narrated Thabit: Anas said, "I will leave no stone unturned in making you offer the prayer as I have seen the Prophet (ï·º)making us offer it." Anas used to do a thing which I have not seen you doing. He used to stand afterthe bowing for such a long time that one would think that he had forgotten (the prostrations) and heused to sit in-between the prostrations so long that one would think that he had forgotten the secondprostration.

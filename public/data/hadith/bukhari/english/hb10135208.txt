10 | 135 | 208 | Narrated Abu Salama: Once I went to Abu- Sa`id Al-Khudri and asked him, "Won't you come with us to the date-palm treesto have a talk?" So Abu Sa`id went out and I asked him, "Tell me what you heard from the Prophet (ﷺ)about the Night of Qadr." Abu Sa`id replied, "Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) performed I`tikaf (seclusion) onthe first ten days of the month of Ramadan and we did the same with him. Gabriel came to him andsaid, 'The night you are looking for is ahead of you.' So the Prophet (ﷺ) performed the I`tikaf in themiddle (second) ten days of the month of Ramadan and we too performed I`tikaf with him. Gabrielcame to him and said, 'The night which you are looking for is ahead of you.' In the morning of the20th of Ramadan the Prophet (ﷺ) delivered a sermon saying, 'Whoever has performed I`tikaf with meshould continue it. I have been shown the Night of "Qadr", but have forgotten its date, but it is in theodd nights of the last ten nights. I saw in my dream that I was prostrating in mud and water.' In thosedays the roof of the mosque was made of branches of date-palm trees. At that time the sky was clearand no cloud was visible, but suddenly a cloud came and it rained. The Prophet (ﷺ) led us in the prayerand I saw the traces of mud on the forehead and on the nose of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). So it was theconfirmation of that dream."

30 | 45 | 64 | Narrated Ibn Abi `Aufa: I was with the Prophet (ﷺ) on a journey, and he observed the fast till evening. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to a man,"Get down and mix Sawiq with water for me." He replied, "Will you wait till it is evening?" TheProphet said, "Get down and mix Sawiq with water for me; when you see night falling from this side,the fasting person should break his fast."

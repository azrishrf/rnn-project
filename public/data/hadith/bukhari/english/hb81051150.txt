81 | 51 | 150 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Allah will say to the person who will have the minimum punishment in the Fire onthe Day of Resurrection, 'If you had things equal to whatever is on the earth, would you ransomyourself (from the punishment) with it?' He will reply, Yes. Allah will say, 'I asked you a much easierthing than this while you were in the backbone of Adam, that is, not to worship others besides Me, butyou refused and insisted to worship others besides Me."'

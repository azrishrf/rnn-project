We are from thetribe of Rabi`a and the infidels of Mudar tribe stand between us and you, so that we cannot come toyou except in the Sacred Months. Therefore we would like you to give us some instructions which wemay follow and convey to our people staying behind us." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I order you to observefour things and forbid you (to do) four things: (I order you) to believe in Allah testifying that Nonehas the right to be worshipped except Allah; to offer the prayer perfectly; to pay the Zakat; and to giveone-fifth of the war booty to Allah. And I forbid you to use Ad-Dubba, Al-Hantam, An-Naqir and Al-Muzaffat." (These are names of utensils in which alcoholic drinks were served.)

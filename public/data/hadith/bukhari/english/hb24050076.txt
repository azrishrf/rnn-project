24 | 50 | 76 | Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair and Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab: Hakim bin Hizam said, "(Once) I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (for something) and he gave it to me. Again Iasked and he gave (it to me). Again I asked and he gave (it to me). And then he said, "O Hakim! Thisproperty is like a sweet fresh fruit; whoever takes it without greediness, he is blessed in it, andwhoever takes it with greediness, he is not blessed in it, and he is like a person who eats but is neversatisfied; and the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (receiving) hand." Hakim added, "I saidto Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) , 'By Him (Allah) Who sent you with the Truth, I shall never accept anything fromanybody after you, till I leave this world.' " Then Abu Bakr (during his caliphate) called Hakim to givehim his share from the war booty (like the other companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) ), he refused to acceptanything. Then `Umar (during his caliphate) called him to give him his share but he refused. On that`Umar said, "O Muslims! I would like you to witness that I offered Hakim his share from this bootyand he refused to take it." So Hakim never took anything from anybody after the Prophet (ﷺ) till he died.

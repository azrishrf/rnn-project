82 | 4 | 11 | Narrated Hudhaifa: The Prophet (ï·º) once delivered a speech in front of us wherein he left nothing but mentioned (about)everything that would happen till the Hour. Some of us stored that our minds and some forgot it.(After that speech) I used to see events taking place (which had been referred to in that speech) but Ihad forgotten them (before their occurrence). Then I would recognize such events as a man recognizesanother man who has been absent and then sees and recognizes him.

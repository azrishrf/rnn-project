80 | 20 | 34 | Narrated `Ikrima: Ibn `Abbas said, "Preach to the people once a week, and if you won't, then preach them twice, but ifyou want to preach more, then let it be three times (a week only), and do not make the people fed-upwith this Qur'an. If you come to some people who are engaged in a talk, don't start interrupting theirtalk by preaching, lest you should cause them to be bored. You should rather keep quiet, and if theyask you, then preach to them at the time when they are eager to hear what you say. And avoid the useof rhymed prose in invocation for I noticed that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and his companions always avoidedit."

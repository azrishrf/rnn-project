You cannot hide yourself from us." So she returned to the Prophet (ﷺ)and mentioned that to him while he was sitting in my dwelling taking his supper and holding a bonecovered with meat in his hand. Then the Divine Inspiration was revealed to him and when that statewas over, he (the Prophet (ﷺ) was saying: "O women! You have been allowed by Allah to go out for yourneeds."

66 | 2 | 7 | Narrated Safwan bin Ya`la bin Umaiya: Ya`la used to say, "I wish I could see Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at the time he is being inspired Divinely." Whenthe Prophet (ﷺ) was at Al-Ja'rana and was shaded by a garment hanging over him and some of hiscompanions were with him, a man perfumed with scent came and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What isyour opinion regarding a man who assumes Ihram and puts on a cloak after perfuming his body withscent?" The Prophet (ﷺ) waited for a while, and then the Divine Inspiration descended upon him. `Umarpointed out to Ya`la, telling him to come. Ya`la came and pushed his head (underneath the screenwhich was covering the Prophet (ﷺ) ) and behold! The Prophet's face was red and he kept on breathingheavily for a while and then he was relieved. Thereupon he said, "Where is the questioner who askedme about `Umra a while ago?" The man was sought and then was brought before the Prophet (ﷺ) who said(to him), "As regards the scent which you perfumed your body with, you must wash it off thrice, andas for your cloak, you must take it off; and then perform in your `Umra all those things which youperform in Hajj."

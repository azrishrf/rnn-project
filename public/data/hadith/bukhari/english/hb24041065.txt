First of all invite them to worship Allah (alone) and when they come to know Allah,inform them that Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers in every day and night; and if they startoffering these prayers, inform them that Allah has enjoined on them, the Zakat. And it is to be takenfrom the rich amongst them and given to the poor amongst them; and if they obey you in that, takeZakat from them and avoid (don't take) the best property of the people as Zakat."

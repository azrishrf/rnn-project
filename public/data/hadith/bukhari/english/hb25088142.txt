25 | 88 | 142 | Narrated Um Al-Fadl bint Al Harith: On the day of `Arafat, some people who were with me, differed about the fasting of the Prophet (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) some said that he was fasting while others said that he was not fasting. So I sent a bowl full of milk to him while he was riding his camel, and he drank that milk.

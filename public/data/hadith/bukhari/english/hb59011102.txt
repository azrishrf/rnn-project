59 | 11 | 102 | Narrated Safiya bint Huyay: While Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in I`tikaf, I called on him at night and having had a talk with him, I got upto depart. He got up also to accompany me to my dwelling place, which was then in the house ofUsama bin Zaid. Two Ansari men passed by, and when they saw the Prophet (ﷺ) they hastened away. TheProphet said (to them). "Don't hurry! It is Safiya, the daughter of Huyay (i.e. my wife)." They said,"Glorified be Allah! O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (How dare we suspect you?)" He said, "Satan circulates in thehuman mind as blood circulates in it, and I was afraid that Satan might throw an evil thought (orsomething) into your hearts."

Salim's father (Ibn `Umar) said, "The following poetic verse occurred to my mind while Iwas looking at the face of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he was praying for rain. He did not get down tillthe rain water flowed profusely from every roof-gutter: And a white (person) who is requested to prayfor rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows . . . And these were thewords of Abu Talib."

62 | 3 | 6 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) addressed the people saying, "Allah has given option to a slave to choose this world orwhat is with Him. The slave has chosen what is with Allah." Abu Bakr wept, and we were astonishedat his weeping caused by what the Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned as to a Slave ( of Allah) who had been offered achoice, (we learned later on) that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) himself was the person who was given the choice,and that Abu Bakr knew best of all of us. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) added, "The person who has favored memost of all both with his company and wealth, is Abu Bakr. If I were to take a Khalil other than myLord, I would have taken Abu Bakr as such, but (what relates us) is the Islamic brotherhood andfriendliness. All the gates of the Mosque should be closed except the gate of Abu Bakr."

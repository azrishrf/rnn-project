96 | 5 | 31 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi: Uwaimir Al-`Ajlani came to `Asim bin `Adi and said, "If a man found another man with his wife andkilled him, would you sentence the husband to death (in Qisas,) i.e., equality in punishment)? O`Asim! Please ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about this matter on my behalf." `Asim asked the Prophet (ﷺ) but theProphet disliked the question and disapproved of it. `Asim returned and informed 'Uwaimir that theProphet disliked that type of question. 'Uwaimir said, "By Allah, I will go (personally) to the Prophet."'Uwaimir came to the Prophet (ﷺ) when Allah had already revealed Qur'anic Verses (in that respect), after`Asim had left (the Prophet (ﷺ) ). So the Prophet (ﷺ) said to 'Uwaimir, "Allah has revealed Qur'anic Versesregarding you and your wife." The Prophet (ﷺ) then called for them, and they came and carried out theorder of Lian.Then 'Uwaimir said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Now if I kept her with me, I would be accused of telling alie." So 'Uwaimir divorced her although the Prophet (ﷺ) did not order him to do so. Later on this practiceof divorcing became the tradition of couples involved in a case of Li'an. The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to thepeople). "Wait for her! If she delivers a red short (small) child like a Wahra (a short red animal). thenI will be of the opinion that he ('Uwaimir) has told a lie but if she delivered a black big-eyed one withbig buttocks, then I will be of the opinion that he has told the truth about her." 'Ultimately she gavebirth to a child that proved the accusation.

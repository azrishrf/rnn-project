Had I not brought the Hadi with me, Iwould have assumed the Ihram for `Umra. "Some of us assumed the Ihram for `Umra while the othersassumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who assumed the Ihram for `Umra. I got menses andkept on menstruating until the day of `Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet. He told me topostpone my `Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assume the Ihram of Hajj and I did so. On thenight of Hasba, he sent my brother `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to at-Tan`im, where Iassumed the Ihram for `Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, "For that (`Umra) no Hadi,fasting or alms were required.

I seek refuge with You from the affliction of the Fire, thepunishment of the Fire, the affliction of the grave, the punishment of the grave, and the evil of theaffliction of poverty. O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the evil of the affliction of Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal, O Allah! Cleanse my heart with the water of snow and hail, and cleanse my heart from all sinsas a white garment is cleansed from filth, and let there be a far away distance between me and my sinsas You made the East and West far away from each other. O Allah! I seek refuge with You fromlaziness, sins, and from being in debt."

24 | 18 | 35 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (p.b.u.h) while he was on the pulpit speaking about charity, to abstain fromasking others for some financial help and about begging others, saying, "The upper hand is better thanthe lower hand. The upper hand is that of the giver and the lower (hand) is that of the beggar."

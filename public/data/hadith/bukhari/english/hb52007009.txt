52 | 7 | 9 | Narrated Aisha: Aflah asked the permission to visit me but I did not allow him. He said, "Do you veil yourself beforeme although I am your uncle?" `Aisha said, "How is that?" Aflah replied, "You were suckled by mybrother's wife with my brother's milk." I asked Allah's Messenger (ï·º) about it, and he said, "Aflah is right, sopermit him to visit you."

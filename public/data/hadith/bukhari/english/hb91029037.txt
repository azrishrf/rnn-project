91 | 29 | 37 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "While I was sleeping, I saw myself standing at a well over which there was abucket. I pulled out from it as many buckets of water as Allah wished, and then Ibn Abi Quhafa (AbuBakr) took the bucket from me and pulled out one or two full buckets, and there was weakness in hispull--may Allah forgive him. Then the bucket turned into a very large one and `Umar bin Al-Khattabtook it. I have never seen any strong man among the people, drawing water with such strength as`Umar did, till the people (drank to their satisfaction and) watered their camels to their fill; whereuponthe camels sat beside the water."

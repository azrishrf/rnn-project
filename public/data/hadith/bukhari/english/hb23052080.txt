23 | 52 | 80 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "When a funeral is ready and the men carry the deceased on their necks (shoulders),if it was pious then it will say, 'Present me quickly', and if it was not pious, then it will say, 'Woe to it(me), where are they taking it (me)?' And its voice is heard by everything except mankind and if heheard it he would fall unconscious."

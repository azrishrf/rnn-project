Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, "Wa 'Alaikas Salam (returned hisgreeting). Go back and pray as you have not prayed (properly)." The man returned, repeated hisprayer, came back and greeted the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Wa alaika-s-Salam (returned hisgreeting). Go back and pray again as you have not prayed (properly)." The man said at the second orthird time, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Kindly teach me how to pray". The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "When you stand forprayer, perform ablution properly and then face the Qibla and say Takbir (Allahu-Akbar), and thenrecite what you know from the Qur'an, and then bow with calmness till you feel at ease then rise frombowing, till you stand straight, and then prostrate calmly (and remain in prostration) till you feel atease, and then raise (your head) and sit with calmness till you feel at ease and then prostrate withcalmness (and remain in prostration) till you feel at ease, and then raise (your head) and sit withcalmness till you feel at ease in the sitting position, and do likewise in whole of your prayer."

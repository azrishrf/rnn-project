66 | 37 | 85 | Narrated `Abdullah: That he heard a man reciting a Quranic Verse which he had heard the Prophet (ﷺ) reciting in a different way. So he took that man to the Prophet (and told him the story). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Both of you are reciting in a correct way, so carry on reciting." The Prophet (ﷺ) further added, "The nations which were before you were destroyed (by Allah) because they differed."

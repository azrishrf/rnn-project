96 | 25 | 85 | Narrated Ubaidullah: Ibn `Abbas said, "Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book(Qur'an) which has been revealed to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) is newer and the latest? You read it pure,undistorted and unchanged, and Allah has told you that the people of the scripture (Jews andChristians) changed their scripture and distorted it, and wrote the scripture with their own hands andsaid, 'It is from Allah,' to sell it for a little gain. Does not the knowledge which has come to youprevent you from asking them about anything? No, by Allah, we have never seen any man from themasking you regarding what has been revealed to you!"

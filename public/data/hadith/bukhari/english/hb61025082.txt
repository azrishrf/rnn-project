61 | 25 | 82 | Narrated `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "I saw (in a dream) the people assembled in a gathering, and then Abu Bakr gotup and drew one or two buckets of water (from a well) but there was weakness in his drawing. MayAllah forgive him. Then `Umar took the bucket and in his hands it turned into a very large bucket. Ihad never seen anyone amongst: the people who could draw the water as strongly as `Umar till all thepeople drank their fill and watered their camels that knelt down there.

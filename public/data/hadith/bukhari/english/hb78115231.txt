78 | 115 | 231 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Naufal: `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Did you benefit Abu Talib with anything as he used to protect and take care of you, and used to become angry for you?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Yes, he is in a shallow place of Fire. But for me he would have been in the lowest part of the Fire."

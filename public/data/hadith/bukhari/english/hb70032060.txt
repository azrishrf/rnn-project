70 | 32 | 60 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I used to accompany Allah's Messenger (ï·º) to fill my stomach; and that was when I did not eat baked bread,nor wear silk. Neither a male nor a female slave used to serve me, and I used to bind stones over mybelly and ask somebody to recite a Qur'anic Verse for me though I knew it, so that he might take meto his house and feed me. Ja`far bin Abi Talib was very kind to the poor, and he used to take us andfeed us with what ever was available in his house, (and if nothing was available), he used to give usthe empty (honey or butter) skin which we would tear and lick whatever was in it.

64 | 38 | 271 | Narrated Jubair bin Mut`im: `Uthman bin `Affan and I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "You had given Banu Al-Muttalib from the Khumus of Khaibar's booty and left us in spite of the fact that we and Banu Al-Muttalib are similarly related to you." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Banu Hashim and Banu Al-Muttalib only are one and the same." So the Prophet (ﷺ) did not give anything to Banu `Abd Shams and Banu Nawfal.

16 | 4 | 7 | Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) In the lifetime of the Prophet (ï·º) the sun eclipsed and he went to theMosque and the people aligned behind him. He said the Takbir (starting the prayer) and prolonged therecitation (from the Qur'an) and then said Takbir and performed a prolonged bowing; then he (liftedhis head and) said, "Sami allahu liman hamidah" (Allah heard him who sent his praises to Him). Hethen did not prostrate but stood up and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the firstrecitation. He again said Takbir and then bowed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first one andthen said, "Sami`a l-lahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walak-lhamd, (Allah heard him who sent hispraises to Him. O our Sustainer! All the praises are for You)" and then prostrated and did the same inthe second rak`a; thus he completed four bowing and four prostrations. The sun (eclipse) had clearedbefore he finished the prayer. (After the prayer) he stood up, glorified and praised Allah as Hedeserved and then said, "The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not eclipsebecause of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see them make haste for the prayer."Narrated Az-Zuhri: I said to 'Urwa, "When the sun eclipsed at Medina your brother (`Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) offered only a two-rak`at prayer like that of the morning (Fajr) prayer." 'Urwa replied, "Yes,for he missed the Prophet's tradition (concerning this matter)."

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) further said, ''While sleeping, I was given the treasures of the worldand two golden bangles were put in my hands, but I felt much annoyed, and those two banglesdistressed me very much, but I was inspired that I should blow them off, so I blew them and they flewaway. Then I interpreted that those two bangles were the liars between whom I was (i.e., the one ofSan`a' and the one of Yamama).

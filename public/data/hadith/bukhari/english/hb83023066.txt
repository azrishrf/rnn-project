83 | 23 | 66 | Narrated `Umar bin Al-Khattab: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "The (reward of) deeds, depend upon the intentions and every personwill get the reward according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for the sake of Allah andHis Apostle, then his emigration will be considered to be for Allah and His Apostle, and whoeveremigrated for the sake of worldly gain or for a woman to marry, then his emigration will beconsidered to be for what he emigrated for."

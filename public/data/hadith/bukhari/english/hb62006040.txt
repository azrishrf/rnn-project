62 | 6 | 40 | Narrated Anas: A man asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment) saying, "When will the Hour be?"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "What have you prepared for it?" The man said, "Nothing, except that I love Allahand His Apostle." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "You will be with those whom you love." We had never been soglad as we were on hearing that saying of the Prophet (i.e., "You will be with those whom you love.")Therefore, I love the Prophet, Abu Bakr and `Umar, and I hope that I will be with them because of mylove for them though my deeds are not similar to theirs.

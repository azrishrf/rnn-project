59 | 6 | 18 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Mus'ud: Allah's Messenger (ï·º), the true and truly inspired said, "(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is puttogether in the womb of the mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for asimilar period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is orderedto write four things. He is ordered to write down his (i.e. the new creature's) deeds, his livelihood, his(date of) death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in religion). Then the soul is breathed intohim. So, a man amongst you may do (good deeds till there is only a cubit between him and Paradiseand then what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deedscharacteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire. And similarly a man amongst you may do (evil) deedstill there is only a cubit between him and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has been written for himdecides his behavior, and he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise."

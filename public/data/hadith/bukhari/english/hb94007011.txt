94 | 7 | 11 | Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib: The Prophet (ﷺ) was carrying earth with us on the day of the battle of Al-Ahzab (confederates) and I sawthat the dust was covering the whiteness of his `Abdomen, and he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) was saying, "(OAllah) ! Without You, we would not have been guided, nor would we have given in charity, nor wouldwe have prayed. So (O Allah!) please send tranquility (Sakina) upon us as they, (the chiefs of theenemy tribes) have rebelled against us. And if they intend affliction (i.e. want to frighten us and fightagainst us) then we would not (flee but withstand them). And the Prophet (ﷺ) used to raise his voice withit.

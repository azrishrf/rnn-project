Abu Rafi' said to Al-Miswar, "Won't you orderthis (i.e. Sa'd) to buy my house which is in my yard?" Sa'd said, "Iwill not offer more than four hundred in installments over a fixedperiod." Abu Rafi said, "I was offered five hundred cash but Irefused. Had I not heard the Prophet (ï·º) saying, 'A neighbor is moreentitled to receive the care of his neighbor,' I would not have soldit to you." The narrator said, to Sufyan: Ma'mar did not say so.Sufyan said, "But he did say so to me." Some people said, "If someonewants to sell a house and deprived somebody of the right ofpreemption, he has the right to play a trick to render the preemptioninvalid. And that is by giving the house to the buyer as a present andmarking its boundaries and giving it to him. The buyer then gives theseller one-thousand Dirham as compensation in which case the preemptorloses his right of preemption."

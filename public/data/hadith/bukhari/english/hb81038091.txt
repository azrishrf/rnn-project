81 | 38 | 91 | Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) had a she-camel called Al-`Adba' and it was too fast to surpass in speed. There came abedouin riding a camel of his, and that camel outstripped it (i.e. Al-Aqba'). That result was hard on theMuslims who said sorrowfully, "Al- Adba has been outstripped." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "It is due fromAllah that nothing would be raised high in this world except that He lowers or puts it down."

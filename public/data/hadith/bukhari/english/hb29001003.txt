They said, "We do not want its price except from Allah" (i.e. they wishedfor a reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered the graves of thepagans to be dug out and the land to be leveled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut datepalmswere fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.

49 | 15 | 28 | Narrated Al-Ma'rur bin Suwaid: I saw Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari wearing a cloak, and his slave, too, was wearing a cloak. We asked himabout that (i.e. how both were wearing similar cloaks). He replied, "Once I abused a man and hecomplained of me to the Prophet (ﷺ) . The Prophet (ﷺ) asked me, 'Did you abuse him by slighting hismother?' He added, 'Your slaves are your brethren upon whom Allah has given you authority. So, ifone has one's brethren under one's control, one should feed them with the like of what one eats andclothe them with the like of what one wears. You should not overburden them with what they cannotbear, and if you do so, help them (in their hard job).

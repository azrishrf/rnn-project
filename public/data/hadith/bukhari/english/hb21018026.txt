21 | 18 | 26 | Narrated Abu Huraira: People say that I narrate too many narrations of the Prophet; once I met a man (during the lifetime ofthe Prophet) and asked him, "Which Sura did Allah's Messenger (ï·º) s recite yesterday in the `Isha' prayer?"He said, "I do not know." I said, "Did you not attend the prayer?" He said, "Yes, (I did)." I said, "Iknow. He recited such and such Sura."

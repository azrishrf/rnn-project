79 | 10 | 14 | Narrated Anas: When the Prophet (ﷺ) married Zainab, the people came and were offered a meal, and then they sat down(after finishing their meals) and started chatting. The Prophet (ﷺ) showed as if he wanted to get up, butthey did not get up. When he noticed that, he got up, and some of the people also got up and wentaway, while some others kept on sitting. When the Prophet (ﷺ) returned to enter, he found the people stillsitting, but then they got up and left. So I told the Prophet (ﷺ) of their departure and he came and went in.I intended to go in but the Prophet (ﷺ) put a screen between me and him, for Allah revealed:-- 'O you whobelieve! Enter not the Prophet's houses..' (33.53)

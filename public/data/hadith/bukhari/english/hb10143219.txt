10 | 143 | 219 | Narrated Aiyub: Abu Qilaba said, "Malik bin Huwairith came to us and led us in the prayer in this mosque of ours andsaid, 'I lead you in prayer but I do not want to offer the prayer but just to show you how Allah'sApostle performed his prayers." I asked Abu Qilaba, "How was the prayer of Malik bin Huwairith?"He replied, "Like the prayer of this Sheikh of ours-- i.e. `Amr bin Salima." That Sheikh used topronounce the Takbir perfectly and when he raised his head from the second prostration he would sitfor a while and then support himself on the ground and get up.

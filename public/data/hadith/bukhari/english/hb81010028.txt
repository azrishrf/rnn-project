81 | 10 | 28 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: I heard Ibn Az-Zubair who was on the pulpit at Mecca, delivering a sermon, saying, "O men! TheProphet used to say, "If the son of Adam were given a valley full of gold, he would love to have asecond one; and if he were given the second one, he would love to have a third, for nothing fills thebelly of Adam's son except dust. And Allah forgives he who repents to Him." Ubai said, "Weconsidered this as a saying from the Qur'an till the Sura (beginning with) 'The mutual rivalry for pilingup of worldly things diverts you..' (102.1) was revealed."

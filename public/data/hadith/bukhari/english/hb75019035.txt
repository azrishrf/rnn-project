75 | 19 | 35 | Narrated Qais bin Abi Hazim: We went to pay a visit to Khabbab (who was sick) and he had been branded (cauterized) at sevenplaces in his body. He said, "Our companions who died (during the lifetime of the Prophet) left (thisworld) without having their rewards reduced through enjoying the pleasures of this life, but we havegot (so much) wealth that we find no way to spend It except on the construction of buildings Had theProphet not forbidden us to wish for death, I would have wished for it.' We visited him for the secondtime while he was building a wall. He said, A Muslim is rewarded (in the Hereafter) for whatever hespends except for something that he spends on building."

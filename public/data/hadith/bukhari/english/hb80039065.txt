80 | 39 | 65 | Narrated `Aisha: The Prophet (ï·º) used to say, "O Allah! I seek refuge with You from laziness and geriatric old age, fromall kinds of sins and from being in debt; from the trial and affliction of the grave and from the punishment in thegrave; from the affliction of the Fire and from the punishment of theFire; and from the evil of the affliction of wealth; and I seek refuge with You from the affliction ofpoverty, and I seek refuge with You from the affliction of Al-Mesiah Ad-Dajjal. O Allah! Wash awaymy sins with the water of snow and hail, and cleanse my heart from all the sins as a white garment iscleansed from the filth, and let there be a long distance between me and my sins, as You made Eastand West far from each other."

63 | 35 | 93 | Narrated Qais: I heard Sa`id bin Zaid saying to the people, "If you but saw me and `Umar's sister tied and forced by`Umar to leave Islam while he was not yet a Muslim. And if the mountain of Uhud could move fromits place for the evil which you people have done to `Uthman, it would have the right to do that."

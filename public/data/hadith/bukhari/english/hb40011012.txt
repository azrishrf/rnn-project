Bilal replied, "I had some inferior type of dates and exchanged two Sas of itfor one Sa of Barni dates in order to give it to the Prophet; to eat." Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said,"Beware! Beware! This is definitely Riba (usury)! This is definitely Riba (Usury)! Don't do so, but ifyou want to buy (a superior kind of dates) sell the inferior dates for money and then buy the superiorkind of dates with that money."

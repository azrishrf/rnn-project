60 | 40 | 96 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "My example and the example o the people is like that of a person who lit a fireand let the moths, butterflies and these insects fall in it." He also said, "There were two women, eachof whom had a child with her. A wolf came and took away the child of one of them, whereupon theother said, 'It has taken your child.' The first said, 'But it has taken your child.' So they both carried thecase before David who judged that the living child be given to the elder lady. So both of them went toSolomon bin David and informed him (of the case). He said, 'Bring me a knife so as to cut the childinto two pieces and distribute it between them.' The younger lady said, 'May Allah be merciful to you!Don't do that, for it is her (i.e. the other lady's) child.' So he gave the child to the younger lady."

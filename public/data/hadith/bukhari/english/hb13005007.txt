13 | 5 | 7 | Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib: The Prophet (ﷺ) delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day of Nahr and said, "Whoeveroffers the prayer like us and slaughters like us then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Allah.And whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the `Id prayer then he has not done the sacrifice." AbiBurda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara' said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have slaughtered my sheep beforethe `Id prayer and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic drinks), and I likedthat my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house. So slaughtered my sheep and took myfood before coming for the prayer." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The sheep which you have slaughtered is justmutton (not a Nusuk)." He (Abu Burda) said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have a young she-goat which isdearer to me than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf? "The Prophet (p.b.u.h)said, "Yes, it will be sufficient for you but it will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone else afteryou."

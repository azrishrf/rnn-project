66 | 4 | 11 | Narrated Al-Bara: There was revealed: 'Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and those who strive and fight inthe Cause of Allah.' (4.95)The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Call Zaid for me and let him bring the board, the inkpot and the scapula bone (orthe scapula bone and the ink pot)."' Then he said, "Write: 'Not equal are those Believers who sit..", andat that time `Amr bin Um Maktum, the blind man was sitting behind the Prophet (ﷺ) . He said, "O Allah'sApostle! What is your order For me (as regards the above Verse) as I am a blind man?" So, instead ofthe above Verse, the following Verse was revealed:'Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury or are blindor lame etc.) and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah.' (4.95)

5 | 18 | 29 | Narrated Maimuna: I placed water for the bath of the Prophet (ï·º) and screened him with a garment. He poured water over hishands and washed them. After that he poured water with his right hand over his left and washed hisprivate parts, rubbed his hands with earth and washed them, rinsed his mouth, washed his nose byputting water in it and then blowing it out and then washed his face and forearms. He poured waterover his head and body. He then shifted from that place and washed his feet. I gave him a piece ofcloth but he did not take it and came out removing the water (from his body) with both his hands.

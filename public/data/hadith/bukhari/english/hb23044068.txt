When he came to him, hefound him surrounded by his household and he asked, "Has he died?" They said, "No, O Allah'sApostle." The Prophet (ﷺ) wept and when the people saw the weeping of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) they allwept. He said, "Will you listen? Allah does not punish for shedding tears, nor for the grief of the heartbut he punishes or bestows His Mercy because of this." He pointed to his tongue and added, "Thedeceased is punished for the wailing of his relatives over him." `Umar used to beat with a stick andthrow stones and put dust over the faces (of those who used to wail over the dead).

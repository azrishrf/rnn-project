Allah will say: 'Bring out the people of the fire.' Adamwill say: 'O Allah! How many are the people of the Fire?' Allah will reply: 'From every one thousand,take out nine-hundred-and ninety-nine.' At that time children will become hoary headed, everypregnant female will have a miscarriage, and one will see mankind as drunken, yet they will not bedrunken, but dreadful will be the Wrath of Allah." The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) asked, "O Allah'sApostle! Who is that (excepted) one?" He said, "Rejoice with glad tidings; one person will be fromyou and one-thousand will be from Gog and Magog."The Prophet (ﷺ) further said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, hope that you will be one-fourth of thepeople of Paradise." We shouted, "Allahu Akbar!" He added, "I hope that you will be one-third of thepeople of Paradise." We shouted, "Allahu Akbar!" He said, "I hope that you will be half of the peopleof Paradise." We shouted, "Allahu Akbar!" He further said, "You (Muslims) (compared with nonMuslims) are like a black hair in the skin of a white ox or like a white hair in the skin of a black ox(i.e. your number is very small as compared with theirs).

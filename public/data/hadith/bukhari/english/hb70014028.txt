So he withdrew his hand. Khalid asked, "Is it unlawful to eat?" theProphet said, "No, but it is not found in the land of my people and that is why I do not like eating it."So Khalid started eating (it) while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was looking at him. An-Nadr said: 'Al-Khazira' (isprepared) from bran while 'Al-Harira' is prepared from milk.

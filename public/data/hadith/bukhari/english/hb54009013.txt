54 | 9 | 13 | Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: A bedouin came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's apostle! I ask you by Allah to judge My caseaccording to Allah's Laws." His opponent, who was more learned than he, said, "Yes, judge betweenus according to Allah's Laws, and allow me to speak." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Speak." He (i .e. thebedouin or the other man) said, "My son was working as a laborer for this (man) and he committedillegal sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that it was obligatory that my son shouldbe stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one hundred sheep and a slave girl.Then I asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me that my son must be lashed onehundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of this (man) must be stoned to death."Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according toAllah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundredlashes and be exiled for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses herguilt, stone her to death." Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)ordered that she be stoned to death.

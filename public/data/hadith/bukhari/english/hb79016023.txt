79 | 16 | 23 | Narrated Abu Hazim: Sahl said, "We used to feel happy on Fridays." I asked Sahl, "Why?" He said, "There was an oldwoman of our acquaintance who used to send somebody to Buda'a (Ibn Maslama said, "Buda'a was agarden of date-palms at Medina). She used to pull out the silq (a kind of vegetable) from its roots andput it in a cooking pot, adding some powdered barley over it (and cook it). After finishing the Jumua(Friday) prayer we used to (pass by her and) greet her, whereupon she would present us with thatmeal, so we used to feel happy because of that. We used to have neither a midday nap, nor meals,except after the Friday prayer."

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) became the bridegroom of Zainab bint Jahsh whom he married atMedina. After the sun had risen high in the sky, the Prophet (ﷺ) invited the people to a meal. Allah'sApostle remained sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left.Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up and went away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of`Aisha's room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and Ialso returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again forthe second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the door of `Aisha's room, hereturned and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) hung acurtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab wasrevealed.

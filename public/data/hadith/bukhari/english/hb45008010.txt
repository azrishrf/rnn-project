45 | 8 | 10 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "An animal should not be milked without the permission of its owner. Does anyof you like that somebody comes to his store and breaks his container and takes away his food? Theudders of the animals are the stores of their owners where their provision is kept, so nobody shouldmilk the animals of somebody else, without the permission of its owner."

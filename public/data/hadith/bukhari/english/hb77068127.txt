77 | 68 | 127 | Narrated Mujahid: We were with Ibn `Abbas and the people mentioned Ad-Dajjal. Someone said, "The word 'Kafir'(unbeliever) is written in between his (Ad-Dajjal's) eyes." Ibn `Abbas said, "I have not heard theProphet saying this, but he said, 'As regards Abraham, he looks like your companion (i.e. the Prophet,Muhammad), and as regards Moses, he is a brown curly haired man riding a camel and reigned with astrong jute rope, as if I am now looking at him getting down in the valley and saying, "Labbaik".'"

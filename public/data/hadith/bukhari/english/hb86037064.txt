Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to them, "What do you find in the Torahregarding the Rajam?" They replied, "We only disgrace and flog them with stripes." `Abdullah binSalam said to them, 'You have told a lie the penalty of Rajam is in the Torah.' They brought the Torahand opened it. One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before andafter it. `Abdullah bin Salam said to him, "Lift up your hand." Where he lifted it there appeared theverse of the Rajam. So they said, "O Muhammad! He has said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it(Torah)." Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) bestoned to death, and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protecther from the stones.

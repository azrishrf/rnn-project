And fighting in it was made legal for mefor a few hours of a day only. None is allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to cut down its trees or tochase its game or to pick up its Luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce itpublicly." `Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib requested the Prophet, "Except Al-Idhkhir, for our goldsmithsand for the roofs of our houses." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Except Al-Idhkhir." `Ikrima said, "Do you knowwhat is meant by chasing its game? It is to drive it out of the shade and sit in its place."

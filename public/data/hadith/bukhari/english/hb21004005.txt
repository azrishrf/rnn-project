21 | 4 | 5 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud: We used to say the greeting, name and greet each other in the prayer. Allah's Messenger (ï·º) heard it andsaid:--"Say, 'at-tahiyyatu lil-lahi was-salawatu wat-taiyibatu . Assalamu 'Alaika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu warahmatu-l-lahi wa-barakatuhu. _ Assalamu alaina wa-'ala 'ibadi-l-lahi as-salihin.. Ashhadu an la ilahailla-l-lah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan `Abdu hu wa Rasuluh. (All the compliments are for Allahand all the prayers and all the good things (are for Allah). Peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah'smercy and blessings (are on you). And peace be on us and on the good (pious) worshipers of Allah. Itestify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave andApostle.) So, when you have said this, then you have surely sent the greetings to every good (pious)worshipper of Allah, whether he be in the Heaven or on the Earth . "

74 | 31 | 65 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: I was with the Prophet (ﷺ) and the time for the `Asr prayer became due. We had no water with us except alittle which was put in a vessel and was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) . He put his hand into it and spread outhis fingers and then said, "Come along! Hurry up! All those who want to perform ablution. Theblessing is from Allah.'' I saw the water gushing out from his fingers. So the people performed theablution and drank, and I tried to drink more of that water (beyond my thirst and capacity), for I knewthat it was a blessing. The sub-narrator said: I asked Jabir, "How many persons were you then?" Hereplied, "We were one-thousand four hundred men." Salim said: Jabir said, 1500.

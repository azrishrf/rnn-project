23 | 75 | 112 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) shrouded every two martyrs of Uhud in one piece of cloth and then he would ask,"Which of them knew more Qur'an?" When one of them was pointed out he would put him first in thegrave. He said, "I am a witness on these." Then he ordered them to be buried with blood on theirbodies. Neither did he offer their funeral prayer nor did he get them washed.

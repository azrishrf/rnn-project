42 | 6 | 8 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair: An Ansari man quarreled with Az-Zubair in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ) about the Harra Canals whichwere used for irrigating the date-palms. The Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, "Let the water pass' butAz-Zubair refused to do so. So, the case was brought before the Prophet (ﷺ) who said to Az-Zubair, "OZubair! Irrigate (your land) and then let the water pass to your neighbor." On that the Ansari got angryand said to the Prophet, "Is it because he (i.e. Zubair) is your aunt's son?" On that the color of the faceof Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) changed (because of anger) and he said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and thenwithhold the water till it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees." Zubair said, "By Allah, Ithink that the following verse was revealed on this occasion": "But no, by your Lord They can haveNo faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them." (4.65)

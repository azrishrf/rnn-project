76 | 42 | 67 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) once came out to us and said, "Some nations were displayed before me. A prophet wouldpass in front of me with one man, and another with two men, and another with a group of people. andanother with nobody with him. Then I saw a great crowd covering the horizon and I wished that theywere my followers, but it was said to me, 'This is Moses and his followers.' Then it was said to me,'Look'' I looked and saw a big gathering with a large number of people covering the horizon. It wassaid, "Look this way and that way.' So I saw a big crowd covering the horizon. Then it was said to me,"These are your followers, and among them there are 70,000 who will enter Paradise without (beingasked about their) accounts. " Then the people dispersed and the Prophet (ﷺ) did not tell who those 70,000were. So the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) started talking about that and some of them said, "As regardsus, we were born in the era of heathenism, but then we believed in Allah and His Apostle . We thinkhowever, that these (70,000) are our offspring." That talk reached the Prophet (ﷺ) who said, "These(70,000) are the people who do not draw an evil omen from (birds) and do not get treated by brandingthemselves and do not treat with Ruqya, but put their trust (only) in their Lord." then 'Ukasha binMuhsin got up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Am I one of those (70,000)?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Yes."Then another person got up and said, "Am I one of them?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, " 'Ukasha has anticipatedyou."

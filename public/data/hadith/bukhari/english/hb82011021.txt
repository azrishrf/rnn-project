82 | 11 | 21 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said to Adam. 'O Adam! You areour father who disappointed us and turned us out of Paradise.' Then Adam said to him, 'O Moses!Allah favored you with His talk (talked to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with HisOwn Hand. Do you blame me for action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before mycreation?' So Adam confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses," the Prophet (ﷺ) added, repeating theStatement three times.

4 | 13 | 13 | Narrated `Aisha: The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqi` at Medina) to answerthe call of nature at night. `Umar used to say to the Prophet (ﷺ) "Let your wives be veiled," but Allah'sApostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam`a the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) went out at `Isha' time andshe was a tall lady. `Umar addressed her and said, "I have recognized you, O Sauda." He said so, as hedesired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may berevealed. So Allah revealed the verses of "Al-Hijab" (A complete body cover excluding the eyes).

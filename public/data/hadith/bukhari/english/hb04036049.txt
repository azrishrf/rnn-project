He added : I layon the bed (cushion transversally) while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his wife lay in the lengthwise direction ofthe cushion. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) slept till the middle of the night, either a bit before or a bit after it andthen woke up, rubbing the traces of sleep off his face with his hands. He then, recited the last tenverses of Sura Al-`Imran, got up and went to a hanging water-skin. He then Performed the ablutionfrom it and it was a perfect ablution, and then stood up to offer the prayer. I, too, got up and did as theProphet had done. Then I went and stood by his side. He placed his right hand on my head and caughtmy right ear and twisted it. He prayed two rak`at then two rak`at and two rak`at and then two rak`atand then two rak`at and then two rak`at (separately six times), and finally one rak`a (the witr).

When he had covered some of the wayto Mecca, he and some companions of his, who were in the state of lhram. remained behind theProphet while Abu Qatada himself was not in the state of Ihram. Abu Qatada, seeing an onager rodehis horse and asked his companions to hand him a whip, but they refused. He then asked them to handhim his spear, but they refused. Then he took it himself and attacked the onager and killed it. Some ofthe Companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ate of it, but some others refused to eat. When they met Allah'sApostle they asked him about that. He said, "It was meal given to you by Allah."

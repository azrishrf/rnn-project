57 | 18 | 49 | Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf: While I was standing in the row on the day (of the battle) of Badr, I looked to my right and my leftand saw two young Ansari boys, and I wished I had been stronger than they. One of them called myattention saying, "O Uncle! Do you know Abu Jahl?" I said, "Yes, What do you want from him, O mynephew?" He said, "I have been informed that he abuses Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). By Him in Whose Hands mylife is, if I should see him, then my body will not leave his body till either of us meet his fate." I wasastonished at that talk. Then the other boy called my attention saying the same as the other had said.After a while I saw Abu Jahl walking amongst the people. I said (to the boys), "Look! This is the manyou asked me about." So, both of them attacked him with their swords and struck him to death andreturned to Allah'S Apostle to inform him of that. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, "Which of you has killedhim?" Each of them said, "I Have killed him." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, "Have you cleaned yourswords?" They said, "No. " He then looked at their swords and said, "No doubt, you both have killedhim and the spoils of the deceased will be given to Mu`adh bin `Amr bin Al-Jamuh." The two boyswere Mu`adh bin 'Afra and Mu`adh bin `Amr bin Al-Jamuh.

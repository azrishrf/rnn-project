92 | 13 | 37 | Narrated Hudhaifa: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I have seen fulfilled and I amwaiting for the fulfillment of the other. The Prophet (ﷺ) told us that the virtue of honesty descended in theroots of men's hearts (from Allah) and then they learned it from the Qur'an and then they learned itfrom the Sunna (the Prophet's traditions). The Prophet (ﷺ) further told us how that honesty will be takenaway: He said: "Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and onlyits trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during whichhonesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an emberis dropped on one's foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would benothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person.It will be said, 'in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,' and later it will be said about some man,'What a wise, polite and strong man he is!' Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seedin his heart." No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) withanyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, andif he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today Ido not deal except with such-and-such person.

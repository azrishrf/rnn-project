67 | 67 | 101 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: I was ten years old when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived at Medina. My mother and aunts used to urge me toserve the Prophet (ﷺ) regularly, and I served him for ten years. When the Prophet (ﷺ) died I was twenty yearsold, and I knew about the order of Al-Hijab (veiling of ladies) more than any other person when it wasrevealed. It was revealed for the first time when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had consummated his marriage withZainab bint Jahsh. When the day dawned, the Prophet (ﷺ) was a bridegroom and he invited the people to abanquet, so they came, ate, and then all left except a few who remained with the Prophet (ﷺ) for a longtime. The Prophet (ﷺ) got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that those people might leavetoo. The Prophet (ﷺ) proceeded and so did I, till he came to the threshold of `Aisha's dwelling place. Thenthinking that these people have left by then, he returned and so did I along with him till he enteredupon Zainab and behold, they were still sitting and had not gone. So the Prophet (ﷺ) again went away andI went away along with him. When we reached the threshold of `Aisha's dwelling place, he thoughtthat they had left, and so he returned and I too, returned along with him and found those people hadleft. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) drew a curtain between me and him, and the Verses of Al-Hijab were revealed.

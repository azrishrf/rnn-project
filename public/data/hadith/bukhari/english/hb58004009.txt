58 | 4 | 9 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: Narrated Anas: Money from Bahrain was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) . He said, "Spread it in the Mosque."It was the biggest amount that had ever been brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . In the meantime Al-`Abbascame to him and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Give me, for I gave the ransom of myself and `Aqil." TheProphet said (to him), "Take." He scooped money with both hands and poured it in his garment andtried to lift it, but he could not and appealed to the Prophet, "Will you order someone to help me inlifting it?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "No." Then Al-`Abbas said, "Then will you yourself help me carry it?"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "No." Then Al `Abbas threw away some of the money, but even then he was notable to lift it, and so he gain requested the Prophet (ﷺ) "Will you order someone to help me carry it?" TheProphet said, "No." Then Al-`Abbas said, "Then will you yourself yelp me carry it?" The Prophet (ﷺ)said, 'No." So, Al-`Abbas threw away some more money and lifted it on his shoulder and went away.The Prophet (ﷺ) kept on looking at him with astonishment at his greediness till he went out of our sight.Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not get up from there till not a single Dirham remained from that money.

61 | 25 | 131 | Narrated Khabbab bin Al-Arat: We complained to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (of the persecution inflicted on us by the infidels) while he wassitting in the shade of the Ka`ba, leaning over his Burd (i.e. covering sheet). We said to him, "Wouldyou seek help for us? Would you pray to Allah for us?" He said, "Among the nations before you a(believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over his headand he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give up his religion. Hisbody would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from the bones and nerves, yetthat would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till atraveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep,but you (people) are hasty.

53 | 10 | 15 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Ka`b bin Malik from Ka`b bin Malik: `Abdullah bin Abu Hadrad Al-Aslami owed Ka`b bin Malik some money. One day the latter met theformer and demanded his right, and their voices grew very loud. The Prophet (ï·º) passed by them and said,"O Ka`b," beckoning with his hand as if intending to say, "Deduct half the debts." So, Ka`b took halfwhat the other owed him and remitted the other half.

81 | 12 | 31 | Narrated `Abdullah: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Who among you considers the wealth of his heirs dearer to him than his ownwealth?" They replied, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! There is none among us but loves his own wealth more."The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "So his wealth is whatever he spends (in Allah's Cause) during his life (on gooddeeds) while the wealth of his heirs is whatever he leaves after his death."

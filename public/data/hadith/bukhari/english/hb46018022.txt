46 | 18 | 22 | Narrated Aisha: Hind bint `Utba (Abu Sufyan's wife) came and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ï·º)! Abu Sufyan is a miser. Isthere any harm if I spend something from his property for our children?" He said, there is no harm foryou if you feed them from it justly and reasonably (with no extravagance).

81 | 19 | 58 | Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, Verily Allah created Mercy. The day He created it, He made it into onehundred parts. He withheld with Him ninety-nine parts, and sent its one part to all His creatures. Hadthe non-believer known of all the Mercy which is in the Hands of Allah, he would not lose hope ofentering Paradise, and had the believer known of all the punishment which is present with Allah, hewould not consider himself safe from the Hell-Fire."

92 | 26 | 74 | Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba: Nobody asked the Prophet (ﷺ) as many questions as I asked regarding Ad-Dajjal. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me,"What worries you about him?" I said, "Because the people say that he will have a mountain of breadand a river of water with him (i.e. he will have abundance of food and water)" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Nay,he is too mean to be allowed such a thing by Allah"' (but it is only to test mankind whether theybelieve in Allah or in Ad-Dajjal.)

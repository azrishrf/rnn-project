72 | 10 | 15 | Narrated Abu Tha`laba Al-Khushani: I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We are living in the land of the people of theScripture and we take our meals in their utensils, and in the land there is game and I hunt with my bowand trained or untrained hounds; please tell me what is lawful for us of that." He said, "As for yoursaying that you are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and that you eat in their utensils, ifyou can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in their utensils, but if you do not find (other thantheirs), then wash their utensils and eat in them. As for your saying that you are in the land of game, ifyou hung something with your bow, and have mentioned Allah's Name while hunting, then you caneat (the game). And if you hunt something with your trained hound, and have mentioned Allah'sName on sending it for hunting then you can eat (the game). But if you hunt something with youruntrained hound and you were able to slaughter it before its death, you can eat of it."

82 | 15 | 26 | Narrated `Aisha: I asked Allah's Messenger (ï·º) about the plague. He said, "That was a means of torture which Allah used tosend upon whom-so-ever He wished, but He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyonewho is residing in a town in which this disease is present, and remains there and does not leave thattown, but has patience and hopes for Allah's reward, and knows that nothing will befall him exceptwhat Allah has written for him, then he will get such reward as that of a martyr."

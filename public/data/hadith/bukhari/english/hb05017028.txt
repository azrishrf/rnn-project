5 | 17 | 28 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Once the call (Iqama) for the prayer was announced and the rows were straightened. Allah's Messenger (ï·º)came out; and when he stood up at his Musalla, he remembered that he was Junub. Then he ordered usto stay at our places and went to take a bath and then returned with water dropping from his head. Hesaid, "Allahu-Akbar", and we all offered the prayer with him.

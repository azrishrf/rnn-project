24 | 4 | 14 | Narrated Zaid bin Wahab: I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met Abu Dhar and asked him, "What hasbrought you to this place?" He said, "I was in Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of(the following verses of the Qur'an): 'They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in theway of Allah.' (9.34). Muawiya said, 'This verse is revealed regarding the people of the scriptures." Isaid, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the scriptures." So we had a quarrel andMu'awiya sent a complaint against me to `Uthman. `Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and Icame to Medina. Many people came to me as if they had not seen me before. So I told this to `Uthmanwho said to me, "You may depart and live nearby if you wish." That was the reason for my being herefor even if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him .

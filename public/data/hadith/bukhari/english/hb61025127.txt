61 | 25 | 127 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: The Prophet (ﷺ) used to stand by a tree or a date-palm on Friday. Then an Ansari woman or man said. "OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall we make a pulpit for you?" He replied, "If you wish." So they made a pulpit forhim and when it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit (for delivering the sermon). The datepalmcried like a child! The Prophet (ﷺ) descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continuedmoaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "It was crying for (missing) what it used tohear of religious knowledge given near to it."

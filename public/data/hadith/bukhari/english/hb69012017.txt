69 | 12 | 17 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: My father died and left seven or nine girls and I married a matron. Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said to me, "OJabir! Have you married?" I said, "Yes." He said, "A virgin or a matron?" I replied, "A matron." hesaid, "Why not a virgin, so that you might play with her and she with you, and you might amuse herand she amuse you." I said, " `Abdullah (my father) died and left girls, and I dislike to marry a girllike them, so I married a lady (matron) so that she may look after them." On that he said, "May Allahbless you," or "That is good."

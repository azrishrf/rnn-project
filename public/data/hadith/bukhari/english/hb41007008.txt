41 | 7 | 8 | Narrated Rafi` bin Khadij: We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We used to rent the land at the yield ofspecific delimited portion of it to be given to the landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portionwas affected by blights etc., while the rest remained safe and vice versa, so the Prophet (ï·º) forbade thispractice. At that time gold or silver were not used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds,they would get so-and-so much.

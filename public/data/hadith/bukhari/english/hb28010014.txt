28 | 10 | 14 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: On the day of the conquest of Mecca, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "There is no more emigration (from Mecca)but Jihad and intentions, and whenever you are called for Jihad, you should go immediately. Nodoubt, Allah has made this place (Mecca) a sanctuary since the creation of the heavens and the earthand will remain a sanctuary till the Day of Resurrection as Allah has ordained its sanctity. Fightingwas not permissible in it for anyone before me, and even for me it was allowed only for a portion of aday. So, it is a sanctuary with Allah's sanctity till the Day of Resurrection. Its thorns should not beuprooted and its game should not be chased; and its luqata (fallen things) should not be picked upexcept by one who would announce that publicly, and its vegetation (grass etc.) should not be cut."Al-`Abbas said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Except Al-Idhkhir, (for it is used by their blacksmiths and fortheir domestic purposes)." So, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Except Al-Idhkhir."

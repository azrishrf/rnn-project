In the morning of thetwentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our baggage, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to us and said, "Whoeverwas m I`tikaf should return to his place of I`tikaf, for I saw (i.e. was informed about the date of) thisNight (of Qadr) and saw myself prostrating in mud and water." When I returned to my place the skywas overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, the sky wascovered with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed with leafstalks ofdate palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet (ﷺ)and its tip.

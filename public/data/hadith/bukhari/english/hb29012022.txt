29 | 12 | 22 | Narrated `Aisha: When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. When Abu Bakr's fever gotworse, he would recite (this poetic verse): "Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death isnearer to him than His shoe laces." And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: "Would thatI could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of goodsmellinggrass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The twomountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Allah! Curse Shaiba binRabi`a and `Utba bin Rabi`a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land ofepidemics." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, "O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or evenmore than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) andmake the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa." Aisha added: Whenwe reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah's lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley ofMedina) used to flow with impure colored water.

63 | 27 | 73 | Narrated Abu As-Safar: I heard Ibn `Abbas saying, "O people! Listen to what I say to you, and let me hear whatever you say,and don't go (without understanding), and start saying, 'Ibn `Abbas said so-and-so, Ibn `Abbas said soand-so, Ibn `Abbas said so-and-so.' He who wants to perform the Tawaf around the Ka`ba should gobehind Al-Hijr (i.e. a portion of the Ka`ba left out unroofed) and do not call it Al-Hatim, for in thepre-Islamic period of ignorance if any man took an oath, he used to throw his whip, shoes or bow in it.

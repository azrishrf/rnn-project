(The Prophet (ﷺ) invoked Allah for rain.) So, the sky became overcastand it started raining till one could hardly reach one's home. It kept on raining till the next Fridaywhen the same man or another man got up and said (to the Prophet), "Invoke Allah to withhold therain from us, for we have been drowned (with heavy rain )."

And I saw cows (being slaughtered) there, but the reward given by Allah isbetter (than worldly benefits). Behold, those cows proved to symbolize the believers (who were killed)on the Day (of the battle) of Uhud, and the good (which I saw in the dream) was the good and thereward and the truth which Allah bestowed upon us after the Badr battle.

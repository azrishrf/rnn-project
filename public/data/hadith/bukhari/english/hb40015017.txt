40 | 15 | 17 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Abu Talha was the richest man in Medina amongst the Ansar and Beeruha' (garden) was the mostbeloved of his property, and it was situated opposite the mosque (of the Prophet.). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)used to enter it and drink from its sweet water. When the following Divine Verse were revealed: 'youwill not attain righteousness till you spend in charity of the things you love' (3.92), Abu Talha got upin front of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah says in His Book, 'You will not attainrighteousness unless you spend (in charity) that which you love,' and verily, the most beloved to me ofmy property is Beeruha (garden), so I give it in charity and hope for its reward from Allah. O Allah'sApostle! Spend it wherever you like." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) appreciated that and said, "That is perishablewealth, that is perishable wealth. I have heard what you have said; I suggest you to distribute it amongyour relatives." Abu Talha said, "I will do so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)." So, Abu Talha distributed it amonghis relatives and cousins. The sub-narrator (Malik) said: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "That is a profitablewealth," instead of "perishable wealth".

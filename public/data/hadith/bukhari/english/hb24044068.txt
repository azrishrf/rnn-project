24 | 44 | 68 | Narrated 'Is-haq bin `Abdullah bin Al Talha: I heard Anas bin Malik saying, "Abu Talha had more property of date-palm trees gardens than anyother amongst the Ansar in Medina and the most beloved of them to him was Bairuha garden, and itwas in front of the Mosque of the Prophet (ﷺ) . Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to go there and used to drink its nicewater." Anas added, "When these verses were revealed:--'By no means shall you Attain righteousnessunless You spend (in charity) of that Which you love. ' (3.92) Abu Talha said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) 'OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no means shall you attain righteousness,unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love. And no doubt, Bairuha' garden is the mostbeloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in charity in Allah's Cause. I expect its rewardfrom Allah. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Spend it where Allah makes you think it feasible.' On that Allah'sApostle said, 'Bravo! It is useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu Talha), and I thinkit would be proper if you gave it to your Kith and kin.' Abu Talha said, I will do so, O Allah'sApostle.' Then Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins."

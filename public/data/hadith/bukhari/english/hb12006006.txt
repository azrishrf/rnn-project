12 | 6 | 6 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) offered the Fajr prayer when it was still dark, then he rode and said, 'AllahAkbar! Khaibar is ruined. When we approach near to a nation, the most unfortunate is the morning ofthose who have been warned." The people came out into the streets saying, "Muhammad and hisarmy." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) vanquished them by force and their warriors were killed; the children andwomen were taken as captives. Safiya was taken by Dihya Al-Kalbi and later she belonged to Allah'sApostle go who married her and her Mahr was her manumission.

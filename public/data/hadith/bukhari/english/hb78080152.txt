78 | 80 | 152 | Narrated Abu Huraira: A bedouin urinated in the mosque, and the people rushed to beat him. Allah's Messenger (ï·º) ordered them to leave him and pour a bucket or a tumbler (full) of water over the place where he has passed urine. The Prophet then said, " You have been sent to make things easy (for the people) and you have not been sent to make things difficult for them."

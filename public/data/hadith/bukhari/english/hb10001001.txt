10 | 1 | 1 | Narrated Anas: The people mentioned the fire and the bell (they suggested those as signals to indicate the starting ofprayers), and by that they mentioned the Jews and the Christians. Then Bilal was ordered topronounce Adhan for the prayer by saying its wordings twice, and for the Iqama (the call for theactual standing for the prayers in rows) by saying its wordings once. (Iqama is pronounced when thepeople are ready for the prayer).

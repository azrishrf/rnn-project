60 | 8 | 25 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Abraham did not tell a lie except on three occasion. Twice for the Sake of Allah when he said, "I amsick," and he said, "(I have not done this but) the big idol has done it." The (third was) that whileAbraham and Sarah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a tyrant.Someone said to the tyrant, "This man (i.e. Abraham) is accompanied by a very charming lady." So,he sent for Abraham and asked him about Sarah saying, "Who is this lady?" Abraham said, "She is mysister." Abraham went to Sarah and said, "O Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earthexcept you and I. This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don'tcontradict my statement." The tyrant then called Sarah and when she went to him, he tried to take holdof her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded. He asked Sarah. "Pray to Allahfor me, and I shall not harm you." So Sarah asked Allah to cure him and he got cured. He tried to takehold of her for the second time, but (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was moreconfounded. He again requested Sarah, "Pray to Allah for me, and I will not harm you." Sarah askedAllah again and he became alright. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her) and said,"You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil." The tyrant then gave Hajar asa girl-servant to Sarah. Sarah came back (to Abraham) while he was praying. Abraham, gesturing withhis hand, asked, "What has happened?" She replied, "Allah has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (orimmoral person) and gave me Hajar for service." (Abu Huraira then addressed his listeners saying,"That (Hajar) was your mother, O Bani Ma-is-Sama (i.e. the Arabs, the descendants of Ishmael,Hajar's son).

59 | 10 | 73 | Narrated Abu Wail: Somebody said to Usama, "Will you go to so-and-so (i.e. `Uthman) and talk to him (i.e. advise himregarding ruling the country)?" He said, "You see that I don't talk to him. Really I talk to (advise) himsecretly without opening a gate (of affliction), for neither do I want to be the first to open it (i.e.rebellion), nor will I say to a man who is my ruler that he is the best of all the people after I haveheard something from Allah s Apostle ." They said, What have you heard him saying? He said, "Ihave heard him saying, "A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and thrown in the (Hell)Fire, so that his intestines will come out, and he will go around like a donkey goes around a millstone.The people of (Hell) Fire will gather around him and say: O so-and-so! What is wrong with you?Didn't you use to order us to do good deeds and forbid us to do bad deeds? He will reply: Yes, I usedto order you to do good deeds, but I did not do them myself, and I used to forbid you to do bad deeds,yet I used to do them myself."

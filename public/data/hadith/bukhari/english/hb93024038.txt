93 | 24 | 38 | Narrated Abu Humaid Al-Sa`idi: The Prophet (ﷺ) appointed a man from the tribe of Bani Asad, called Ibn Al-Utabiyya to collect the Zakat.When he returned (with the money) he said (to the Prophet), "This is for you and this has been givento me as a gift." The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up on the pulpit (Sufyan said he ascended the pulpit), and afterglorifying and praising Allah, he said, "What is wrong with the employee whom we send (to collectZakat from the public) that he returns to say, 'This is for you and that is for me?' Why didn't he stay athis father's and mother's house to see whether he will be given gifts or not? By Him in Whose Handmy life is, whoever takes anything illegally will bring it on the Day of Resurrection by carrying it overhis neck: if it is a camel, it will be grunting: if it is a cow, it will be mooing: and if it is a sheep it willbe bleating!" The Prophet (ﷺ) then raised both his hands till we saw the whiteness of his armpits (and hesaid), "No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Allah's Message?" And he repeated it three times.

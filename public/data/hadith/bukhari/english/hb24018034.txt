24 | 18 | 34 | Narrated Hakim bin Hizam: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "The upper hand is better than the lower hand (i.e. he who gives in charity is betterthan him who takes it). One should start giving first to his dependents. And the best object of charityis that which is given by a wealthy person (from the money which is left after his expenses). Andwhoever abstains from asking others for some financial help, Allah will give him and save him fromasking others, Allah will make him self-sufficient."

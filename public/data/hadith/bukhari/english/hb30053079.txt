30 | 53 | 79 | Narrated Humaid: I asked Anas about the fasting of the Prophet. He said "Whenever I liked to see the Prophet (ﷺ) fasting inany month, I could see that, and whenever I liked to see him not fasting, I could see that too, and if Iliked to see him praying in any night, I could see that, and if I liked to see him sleeping, I could seethat, too." Anas further said, "I never touched silk or velvet softer than the hand of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) andnever smelled musk or perfumed smoke more pleasant than the smell of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)."

57 | 15 | 43 | Narrated Jabir: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to me), "If the property of Bahrain had come to us, I would have given you somuch and so much." But the Bahrain property did not come till the Prophet (ﷺ) had died. When theBahrain property came. Abu Bakr ordered somebody to announce, "Any person who has money claimon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) or whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had promised something, should come to us." So, I wentto him and said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had promised to give me so much an so much." Abu Bakr scoopedup money with both hands thrice for me." (The sub-narrator Sufyan illustrated this action by scoopingup with both hands and said, "Ibn Munkadir, another sub-narrator, used to illustrate it in this way.")Narrated Jabir: Once I went to Abu Bakr and asked for the money but he did not give me, and I wentto him again, but he did not give me, so I went to him for the third time and said, "I asked you, butyou did not give me; then I asked you (for the second time) and you did not give me; then I asked you(for the third time) but you did not give me. You should either give me or allow yourself to beconsidered a miser regarding my case." Abu Bakr said, "You tell me that I am a miser with regard toyou. But really, whenever I rejected your request, I had the inclination to give you."(In another narration Jabir added:) So, Abu Bakr scooped up money with both hands for me and askedme to count it. I found out that It was five hundred. Abu Bakr told me to take twice that amount.

10 | 77 | 123 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: I prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ) one night and stood on his left side. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) caught hold of my headfrom behind and drew me to his right and then offered the prayer and slept. Later the Mu'adh-dhincame and the Prophet (ﷺ) stood up for prayer without performing ablution.

18 | 6 | 13 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: And Salim added, "Ibn `Umar used to pray theMaghrib and `Isha' prayers together in Al-Muzdalifa." Salim said, "Ibn `Umar delayed the Maghribprayer because at that time he heard the news of the death of his wife Safiya bint Abi `Ubaid. I said tohim, 'The prayer (is due).' He said, 'Go on.' Again I said, 'The prayer (is due).' He said, 'Go on,' till wecovered two or three miles. Then he got down, prayed and said, 'I saw the Prophet (ï·º) praying in this way,whenever he was in a hurry during the journey.' `Abdullah (bin `Umar) added, "Whenever theProphet was in a hurry, he used to delay the Maghrib prayer and then offer three rak`at (of theMaghrib) and perform Taslim, and after waiting for a short while, Iqama used to be pronounced forthe `Isha' prayer when he would offer two rak`at and perform Taslim. He would never offer anyoptional prayer till the middle of the night (when he used to pray the Tahajjud)."

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "if the killing tool causes bloodto gush out, and if Allah's Name is mentioned, eat (of the slaughtered animal). But do not slaughterwith a nail or a tooth, for the nail is the knife of Ethiopians and a tooth is a bone." Suddenly a camelran away and it was stopped (with an arrow). The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, "Of these camels there are somewhich are as wild as wild beasts; so if one of them runs away from you and you cannot catch it, treat itin this manner (i.e. shoot it with an arrow).

61 | 25 | 93 | Narrated Abu `Uthman: I got the news that Gabriel came to the Prophet (ﷺ) while Um Salama was present. Gabriel started talking(to the Prophet (ﷺ) and then left. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Um Salama, "(Do you know) who it was?" (or asimilar question). She said, "It was Dihya (a handsome person amongst the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ))." Later on Um Salama said, "By Allah! I thought he was none but Dihya, till I heard the Prophet (ﷺ)talking about Gabriel in his sermon." (The Sub-narrator asked Abu `Uthman, "From where have youheard this narration?" He replied, "From Usama bin Zaid.")

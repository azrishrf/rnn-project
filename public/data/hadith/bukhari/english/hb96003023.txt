Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed in itfor a few nights till the people gathered (to pray the night prayer (Tarawih) (behind him.) Then on the4th night the people did not hear his voice and they thought he had slept, so some of them startedhumming in order that he might come out. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, "You continued doing what I sawyou doing till I was afraid that this (Tarawih prayer) might be enjoined on you, and if it were enjoinedon you, you would not continue performing it. Therefore, O people! Perform your prayers at yourhomes, for the best prayer of a person is what is performed at his home except the compulsorycongregational) prayer."

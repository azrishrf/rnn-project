Then he made her sit on his right or on his left side, and then he told hera secret and she started weeping. I asked her, "Why are you weeping?" He again told her a secret andshe started laughing. I said, "I never saw happiness so near to sadness as I saw today." I asked herwhat the Prophet (ﷺ) had told her. She said, "I would never disclose the secret of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)." Whenthe Prophet (ﷺ) died, I asked her about it. She replied. "The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Every year Gabriel used torevise the Qur'an with me once only, but this year he has done so twice. I think this portends mydeath, and you will be the first of my family to follow me.' So I started weeping. Then he said. 'Don'tyou like to be the chief of all the ladies of Paradise or the chief of the believing women? So Ilaughed for that."

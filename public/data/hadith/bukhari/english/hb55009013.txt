55 | 9 | 13 | Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Hakim bin Hizam said, "I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for something, and he gave me, and I asked him againand he gave me and said, 'O Hakim! This wealth is green and sweet (i.e. as tempting as fruits), andwhoever takes it without greed then he is blessed in it, and whoever takes it with greediness, he is notblessed in it and he is like one who eats and never gets satisfied.The upper (i.e. giving) hand is better than the lower (i.e. taking) hand." Hakim added, "I said, OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth I will never demand anything fromanybody after you till I die." Afterwards Abu Bakr used to call Hakim to give him something but herefused to accept anything from him. Then `Umar called him to give him (something) but he refused.Then `Umar said, "O Muslims! I offered to him (i.e. Hakim) his share which Allah has ordained forhim from this booty and he refuses to take it." Thus Hakim did not ask anybody for anything after theProphet, till he died--may Allah bestow His mercy upon him.

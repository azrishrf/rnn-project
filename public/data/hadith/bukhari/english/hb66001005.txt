66 | 1 | 5 | Narrated Jundub: Once the Prophet (ï·º) fell ill and did not offer the night prayer (Tahajjud prayer) for a night or two. Awoman (the wife of Abu Lahab) came to him and said, "O Muhammad ! I do not see but that yourSatan has left you." Then Allah revealed (Surat-Ad-Duha):'By the fore-noon, and by the night when it darkens (or is still); Your Lord has not forsaken you, norhated you.' (93)

6 | 27 | 37 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: A woman is allowed to leave (go back home) if she gets menses (after Tawaf-Al-Ifada). Ibn `Umarformerly used to say that she should not leave but later on I heard him saying, "She may leave, sinceAllah's Messenger (ï·º) gave them the permission to leave (after Tawaf-Al-Ifada)."

68 | 32 | 60 | Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair: I asked Ibn `Umar, "(What is the verdict if) a man accuses his wife of illegal sexual intercourse?" Ibn`Umar said, "The Prophet (ï·º) separated (by divorce) the couple of Bani Al-Ajlan, and said, (to them),'Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent?' But both of them refused. Heagain said, 'Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent?' But both of themrefused. So he separated them by divorce." (Aiyub, a sub-narrator said: `Amr bin Dinar said to me,"There is something else in this Hadith which you have not mentioned. It goes thus: The man said,'What about my money (i.e. the Mahr that I have given to my wife)?' It was said, 'You have no right torestore any money, for if you have spoken the truth (as regards the accusation), you have alsoconsummated your marriage with her; and if you have told a lie, you are less rightful to have yourmoney back.'

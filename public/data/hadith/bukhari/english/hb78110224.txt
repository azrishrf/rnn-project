78 | 110 | 224 | Narrated Abu Hurairah (ra): When the Prophet (ï·º) (once) raised his head after bowing [in the Salat (prayer)] he said, "O Allah, save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid and Salama bin Hisham and 'Aiyyash bin Abu Rabi'a and the helpless weak believers of Makkah. O Allah, be hard on the tribe of Mudar. O Allah, send on them (famine-drought) years like the (famine-drought) years of (the Prophet) Yusuf (Joseph)."

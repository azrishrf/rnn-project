79 | 40 | 54 | Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d: There was no name dearer to `Ali than his nickname Abu Turab (the father of dust). He used to feelhappy whenever he was called by this name. Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to the house of Fatima butdid not find `Ali in the house. So he asked "Where is your cousin?" She replied, "There wassomething (a quarrel) between me and him whereupon he got angry with me and went out withouthaving a midday nap in my house." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked a person to look for him. That person came,and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He (Ali) is sleeping in the mosque." So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went there andfound him lying. His upper body cover had fallen off to one side of his body, and so he was coveredwith dust. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) started cleaning the dust from him, saying, "Get up, O Abu Turab! Get up,Abu Turab!"

80 | 58 | 90 | Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) sent a Sariya (an army detachment) consisting of men called Al-Qurra', and all of themwere martyred. I had never seen the Prophet (ﷺ) so sad over anything as he was over them. So he saidQunut (invocation in the prayer) for one month in the Fajr prayer, invoking for Allah's wrath upon thetribe of 'Usaiya, and he used to say, "The people of 'Usaiya have disobeyed Allah and His Apostle."

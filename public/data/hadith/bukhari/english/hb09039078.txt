9 | 39 | 78 | Narrated Abu-l-Minhal: My father and I went to Abi Barza Al-Aslami and my father said to him, "Tell us how Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)used to offer the compulsory congregational prayers." He said, "He used to pray the Zuhr prayer,which you call the first prayer, as the sun declined at noon, the `Asr at a time when one of US couldgo to his family at the farthest place in Medina while the sun was still hot. (The narrator forgot whatAbu Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet (ﷺ) preferred to pray the `Isha' late anddisliked to sleep before it or talk after it. And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer atsuch a time when it was possible for one to recognize the person sitting by his side and he (theProphet) used to recite 60 to 100 'Ayat' (verses) of the Qur'an in it."

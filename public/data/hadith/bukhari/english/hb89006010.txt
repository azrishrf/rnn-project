So when Abraham had sent Sarah, the tyrant got up, intending to do evil with her, but she got upand performed ablution and prayed and said, 'O Allah ! If I have believed in You and in Your Apostle,then do not empower this oppressor over me.' So he (the king) had an epileptic fit and started movinghis legs violently. "

67 | 68 | 102 | Narrated Anas: When `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf married an Ansari woman, the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, "How much Mahrdid you give her?" `Abdur-Rahman said, "Gold equal to the weight of a date stone." Anas added:When they (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions) arrived at Medina, the emigrants stayed at theAnsar's houses. `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf stayed at Sa`d bin Ar-Rabi's house. Sa`d said to `Abdur-Rahman, "I will divide and share my property with you and will give one of my two wives to you."`Abdur-Rahman said, "May Allah bless you, your wives and property (I am not in need of that; butkindly show me the way to the market)." So `Abdur-Rahman went to the market and traded theregaining a profit of some dried yoghurt and butter, and married (an Ansari woman). The Prophet (ﷺ) saidto him, "Give a banquet, even if with one sheep."

7 | 8 | 14 | Narrated Al-A`mash: Shaqiq said, "While I was sitting with `Abdullah and Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, the latter asked theformer, 'If a person becomes Junub and does not find water for one month, can he performTayammum and offer his prayer?' (He applied in the negative). Abu Musa said, 'What do you sayabout this verse from Sura "Al-Ma'ida": When you do not find water then perform Tayammum withclean earth? `Abdullah replied, 'If we allowed it then they would probably perform Tayammum withclean earth even if water were available but cold.' I said to Shaqiq, 'You then disliked to performTayammum because of this?' Shaqiq said, 'Yes.' (Shaqiq added), "Abu Musa said, 'Haven't you heardthe statement of `Ammar to `Umar? He said: I was sent out by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for some job and Ibecame Junub and could not find water so I rolled myself over the dust (clean earth) like an animaldoes, and when I told the Prophet (ﷺ) of that he said, 'Like this would have been sufficient.' The Prophet (ﷺ)(saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and blew it off, then passed his (left) hand overthe back of his right hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then passed them overhis face.' So `Abdullah said to Abu- Musa, 'Don't you know that `Umar was not satisfied with`Ammar's statement?' "Narrated Shaqiq: While I was with `Abdullah and Abu Musa, the latter said to the former, "Haven'tyou heard the statement of `Ammar to `Umar? He said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent you and me out and Ibecame Junub and rolled myself in the dust (clean earth) (for Tayammum). When we came to Allah'sApostle I told him about it and he said, 'This would have been sufficient,' passing his hands over hisface and the backs of his hands once only.' "

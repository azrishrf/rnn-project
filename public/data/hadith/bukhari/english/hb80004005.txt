80 | 4 | 5 | Narrated Al-Harith bin Suwaid: `Abdullah bin Mas`ud related to us two narrations: One from the Prophet (ﷺ) and the other from himself,saying: A believer sees his sins as if he were sitting under a mountain which, he is afraid, may fall onhim; whereas the wicked person considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drivesthem away like this." Abu Shihab (the sub-narrator) moved his hand over his nose in illustration. (IbnMas`ud added): Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than aman who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized, but he has his riding beast carrying his foodand water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a short while and wakes to find his riding beast gone.(He starts looking for it) and suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished (him to sufferfrom). He then says, 'I will go back to my place.' He returns and sleeps again, and then (getting up), heraises his head to find his riding beast standing beside him."

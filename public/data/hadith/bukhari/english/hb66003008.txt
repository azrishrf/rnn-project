66 | 3 | 8 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to `Uthman at the time when the people of Sham and the people of Iraqwere Waging war to conquer Arminya and Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people ofSham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Qur'an, so he said to `Uthman, "O chief of theBelievers! Save this nation before they differ about the Book (Qur'an) as Jews and the Christians didbefore." So `Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, "Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so thatwe may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you." Hafsasent it to `Uthman. `Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin AzZubair, Sa`id bin Al-Asand `AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. `Uthman saidto the three Quraishi men, "In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur'an, thenwrite it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur'an was revealed in their tongue." They did so, and when theyhad written many copies, `Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. `Uthman sent to everyMuslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur'anic materials,whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.

30 | 16 | 26 | Narrated `Adi bin Hatim: When the above verses were revealed: 'Until the white thread appears to you, distinct from the blackthread,' I took two (hair) strings, one black and the other white, and kept them under my pillow andwent on looking at them throughout the night but could not make anything out of it. So, the nextmorning I went to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and told him the whole story. He explained to me, "That versemeans the darkness of the night and the whiteness of the dawn."

63 | 46 | 157 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived at Medina, he alighted at the upper part of Medina among the peoplecalled Bani `Amr bin `Auf and he stayed with them for fourteen nights. Then he sent for the chiefs ofBani An-Najjar, and they came, carrying their swords. As if I am just now looking at Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)on his she-camel with Abu Bakr riding behind him (on the same camel) and the chiefs of Bani An-Najjar around him till he dismounted in the courtyard of Abu Aiyub's home. The Prophet (ﷺ) used to offerthe prayer wherever the prayer was due, and he would pray even in sheepfolds. Then he ordered thatthe mosque be built. He sent for the chiefs of Banu An-Najjar, and when they came, he said, "O BanuAn-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this garden of yours." They replied "No! By Allah, we do notdemand its price except from Allah." In that garden there were the (following) things that I will tellyou: Graves of pagans, unleveled land with holes and pits etc., and date-palm trees. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug up and, the unleveled land be leveled and the date-palmtrees be cut down. The trunks of the trees were arranged so as to form the wall facing the Qibla. TheStone pillars were built at the sides of its gate. The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) were carrying thestones and reciting some lyrics, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . . was with them and they were saying, "O Allah!There is no good Excel the good of the Hereafter, so bestow victory on the Ansar and the Emigrants.

8 | 32 | 55 | Narrated `Umar (bin Al-Khattab): My Lord agreed with me in three things:-1. I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I wish we took the station of Abraham as our praying place (for some ofour prayers). So came the Divine Inspiration: And take you (people) the station of Abraham as a placeof prayer (for some of your prayers e.g. two rak`at of Tawaf of Ka`ba)". (2.125)-2. And as regards the (verse of) the veiling of the women, I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I wish youordered your wives to cover themselves from the men because good and bad ones talk to them.' So theverse of the veiling of the women was revealed.-3. Once the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) made a united front against the Prophet (ﷺ) and I said to them, 'It maybe if he (the Prophet) divorced you, (all) that his Lord (Allah) will give him instead of you wivesbetter than you.' So this verse (the same as I had said) was revealed." (66.5).

24 | 28 | 50 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The example of a miser and an almsgiver is like the example of two personswearing iron cloaks." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also said, "The example of an almsgiver and a miser is like theexample of two persons who have two iron cloaks on them from their breasts to their collar bones, andwhen the almsgiver wants to give in charity, the cloak becomes capacious till it covers his whole bodyto such an extent that it hides his fingertips and covers his footprints (obliterates his tracks). (1) Andwhen the miser wants to spend, it (the iron cloak) sticks and every ring gets stuck to its place and hetries to widen it, but it did not become wide.

28 | 9 | 13 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: "The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Allah has made Mecca, a sanctuary, so it was a sanctuary before me and willcontinue to be a sanctuary after me. It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for afew hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) itsgame, or to pick up its luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he hasfound) publicly.' Al-`Abbas said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Except Al-Idhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it isused) by our goldsmiths and for our graves.' The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, 'Except Al-Idhkhir.' " `Ikrima said,'Do you know what "chasing or disturbing" the game means? It means driving it out of the shade tooccupy its place."

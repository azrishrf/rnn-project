57 | 19 | 53 | Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Hakim bin Hizam said, "I asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for something, and he gave me. I asked him again,and he gave me, and said to me. 'O Hakim! This wealth is like green sweet (i.e. fruit), and if one takesit without greed, then one is blessed in it, and if one takes it with greediness, then one is not blessed init, and will be like the one who eats without satisfaction. And an upper (i.e. giving) hand is better thana lower (i.e. taking) hand,' I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I willnot ask anyone for anything after you till I leave this world." So, when Abu Bakr during his Caliphate,called Hakim to give him (some money), Hakim refused to accept anything from him. Once `Umarcalled him (during his Caliphate) in order to give him something, but Hakim refused to accept it,whereupon `Umar said, "O Muslims! I give him (i.e. Hakim) his right which Allah has assigned tohim) from this Fai '(booty), but he refuses to take it." So Hakim never took anything from anybodyafter the Prophet (ﷺ) till he died.

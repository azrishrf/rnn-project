They did not Inform me of theonager but they wished that I would see it Suddenly I looked and saw the onager Then I headedtowards my horse, saddled it and rode, but I forgot to take the lash and the spear. So I said to them mycompanions), "Give me the lash and the spear." But they said, "No, by Allah we will not help you inany way to hunt it ' I got angry, dismounted, took it the spear and the lash), rode (the horse chased theonager and wounded it Then I brought it when it had dyed. My companions started eating of its(cooked) meat, but they suspected that it might be unlawful to eat of its meat while they were in astate of Ihram Then I proceeded further and I kept one of its forelegs with me. When we met Allah'sApostle we asked him about that. He said, "Have you some of its meat with you?" I gave him thatforeleg and he ate the meat till he stripped the bone of its flesh although he was in a state of Ihram.

68 | 44 | 77 | Narrated Nafi`: Ibn `Umar bin Al-Khattab divorced his wife during her menses. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered him to takeher back till she became clean, and when she got another period while she was with him, she shouldwait till she became clean again and only then, if he wanted to divorce her, he could do so beforehaving sexual relations with her. And that is the period Allah has fixed for divorcing women.Whenever `Abdullah (bin `Umar) was asked about that, he would say to the questioner, "If youdivorced her thrice, she is no longer lawful for you unless she marries another man (and the other mandivorces her in his turn).' Ibn `Umar further said, 'Would that you (people) only give one or twodivorces, because the Prophet (ﷺ) has ordered me so."

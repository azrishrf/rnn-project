43 | 9 | 12 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: When my father died he owed a Jew thirty Awsuq (of dates). I requested him to give me respite forrepaying but he refused. I requested Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to intercede with the Jew. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went tothe Jew and asked him to accept the fruits of my trees in place of the debt but the Jew refused. Allah'sApostle entered the garden of the date-palms, wandering among the trees and ordered me (saying),"Pluck (the fruits) and give him his due." So, I plucked the fruits for him after the departure of Allah'sApostle and gave his thirty Awsuq, and still had seventeen Awsuq extra for myself. Jabir said: I wentto Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to inform of what had happened, but found him praying the `Asr prayer. After theprayer I told him about the extra fruits which remained. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told me to inform (`Umar) IbnAl-Khattab about it. When I went to `Umar and told him about it, `Umar said, "When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)walked in your garden, I was sure that Allah would definitely bless it."

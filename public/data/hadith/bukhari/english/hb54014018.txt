54 | 14 | 18 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: When the people of Khaibar dislocated `Abdullah bin `Umar's hands and feet, `Umar got updelivering a sermon saying, "No doubt, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) made a contract with the Jews concerningtheir properties, and said to them, 'We allow you (to stand in your land) as long as Allah allows you.'Now `Abdullah bin `Umar went to his land and was attacked at night, and his hands and feet weredislocated, and as we have no enemies there except those Jews, they are our enemies and the onlypeople whom we suspect, I have made up my mind to exile them." When `Umar decided to carry outhis decision, a son of Abu Al-Haqiq's came and addressed `Umar, "O chief of the believers, will youexile us although Muhammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a contract with us about ourproperties, and accepted the condition of our residence in our land?" `Umar said, "Do you think that Ihave forgotten the statement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), i.e.: What will your condition be when you areexpelled from Khaibar and your camel will be carrying you night after night?" The Jew replied, "Thatwas joke from Abul-Qasim." `Umar said, "O the enemy of Allah! You are telling a lie." `Umar thendrove them out and paid them the price of their properties in the form of fruits, money, camel saddlesand ropes, etc."

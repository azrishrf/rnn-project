72 | 36 | 69 | Narrated Rait' bin Khadij: I said to the Prophet, "We will be facing the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives (forslaughtering)' He said, "If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out,and if Allah's Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, unless the killing instrument is a tooth ornail. I will tell you why: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians."The quick ones among the people got the war booty while the Prophet (ﷺ) was behind the people. So theyplaced the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered the cooking pots to be turned upsidedown. Then he distributed (the war booty) among them, considering one camel as equal to ten sheep.Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with them, so aman shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Of these animals there aresome which are as wild as wild beasts. So, if anyone of them runs away like this, do like this (shoot itwith an arrow).

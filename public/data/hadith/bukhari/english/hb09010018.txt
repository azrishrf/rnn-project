9 | 10 | 18 | Narrated Abu Dhar Al-Ghifar: We were with the Prophet (ﷺ) on a journey and the Mu'adh-dhin (call maker for the prayer) wanted topronounce the Adhan (call) for the Zuhr prayer. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Let it become cooler." He again(after a while) wanted to pronounce the Adhan but the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, "Let it become cooler tillwe see the shadows of hillocks." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "The severity of heat is from the raging of theHell-fire, and in very hot weather pray (Zuhr) when it becomes cooler."

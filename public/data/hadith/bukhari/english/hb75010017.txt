75 | 10 | 17 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) went to visit a sick bedouin. Whenever the Prophet (ﷺ) went to a patient, he used to say tohim, "Don't worry, if Allah will, it will be expiation (for your sins):" The bedouin said, "You sayexpiation? No, it is but a fever that is boiling or harassing an old man and will lead him to his gravewithout his will." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Then, yes, it is so."

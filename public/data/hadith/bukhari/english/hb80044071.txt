80 | 44 | 71 | Narrated `Aisha: The Prophet (ï·º) used to say, "O Allah! I seek refuge with You from laziness from geriatric old age, frombeing in debt, and from committing sins. O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the punishment of theFire, the afflictions of the grave, the punishment in the grave, and the evil of the affliction of povertyand from the evil of the affliction caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal. O Allah! Wash away my sins withthe water of snow and hail, and cleanse my heart from the sins as a white garment is cleansed of filth,and let there be a far away distance between me and my sins as You have set far away the East and theWest from each other."

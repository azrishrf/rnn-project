61 | 25 | 113 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet (ﷺ) noticed the absence of Thabit bin Qais. A man said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I shall bring youhis news." So he went to him and saw him sitting in his house drooping his head (sadly). He askedThabit, "What's the matter?" Thabit replied, "An evil situation: A man used to raise his voice over thevoice of the Prophet (ﷺ) and so all his good deeds have been annulled and he is from the people of Hell."The man went back and told the Prophet (ﷺ) that Thabit had said so-and-so. (The sub-narrator, Musa binAnas said, "The man went to Thabit again with glad tidings)." The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, "Go and sayto Thabit: 'You are not from the people of Fire, but from the people of Paradise."

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me while I was weeping. Hesaid 'What is the matter with you? Have you got your menses?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'This is a thingwhich Allah has ordained for the daughters of Adam. So do what all the pilgrims do with theexception of the Tawaf (Circumambulation) round the Ka`ba." `Aisha added, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)sacrificed cows on behalf of his wives."

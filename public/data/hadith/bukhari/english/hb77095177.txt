77 | 95 | 177 | Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet)I bought a cushion having pictures on it. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw it, he stopped at the gate and didnot enter. I noticed the signs of hatred (for that) on his face! I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I turn to Allahand His Apostle in repentance! What sin have I committed?" He said, "What about this cushion?" Isaid, 'I bought it for you to sit on and recline on." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The makers of these pictureswill be punished (severely) on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them, 'Make alive whatyou have created.'" He added, "Angels do not enter a house in which there are pictures."

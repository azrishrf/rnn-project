78 | 82 | 158 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika: The Prophet (ﷺ) was given a gift of a few silken cloaks with gold buttons. He distributed them amongst some of his companions and put aside one of them for Makhrama. When Makhrama came, the Prophet said, "I kept this for you." (Aiyub, the sub-narrator held his garment to show how the Prophet (ﷺ) showed the cloak to Makhrama who had something unfavorable about his temper.)

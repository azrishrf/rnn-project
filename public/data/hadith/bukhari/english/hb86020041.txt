I heard the Prophet (ï·º) saying,"The Hour will not be established" or said: "From among the portentsof the Hour is that the religious knowledge will betaken away (by thedeath of religious Scholars) and general ignorance (of religion) willappear; and the drinking of alcoholic drinks will be very common, and(open) illegal sexual intercourse will prevail, and men will decreasein number while women will increase so much so that, for fifty womenthere will only be one man to look after them."

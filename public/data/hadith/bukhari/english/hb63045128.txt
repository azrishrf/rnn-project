63 | 45 | 128 | Narrated Abu `Uthman: I heard that Ibn `Umar used to become angry if someone mentioned that he had migrated before hisfather (`Umar), and he used to say, " `Umar and I came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and found him having hismidday rest, so we returned home. Then `Umar sent me again (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ) and said, 'Go and seewhether he is awake.' I went to him and entered his place and gave him the pledge of allegiance. ThenI went back to `Umar and informed him that the Prophet (ﷺ) was awake. So we both went, runningslowly, and when `Umar entered his place, he gave him the pledge of allegiance and thereafter I toogave him the pledge of allegiance."

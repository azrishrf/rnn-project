59 | 11 | 81 | Narrated `Aisha: Magic was worked on the Prophet (ﷺ) so that he began to fancy that he was doing a thing which he wasnot actually doing. One day he invoked (Allah) for a long period and then said, "I feel that Allah hasinspired me as how to cure myself. Two persons came to me (in my dream) and sat, one by my headand the other by my feet. One of them asked the other, "What is the ailment of this man?" The otherreplied, 'He has been bewitched" The first asked, 'Who has bewitched him?' The other replied, 'Lubaidbin Al-A'sam.' The first one asked, 'What material has he used?' The other replied, 'A comb, the hairgathered on it, and the outer skin of the pollen of the male date-palm.' The first asked, 'Where is that?'The other replied, 'It is in the well of Dharwan.' " So, the Prophet (ﷺ) went out towards the well and thenreturned and said to me on his return, "Its date-palms (the date-palms near the well) are like the headsof the devils." I asked, "Did you take out those things with which the magic was worked?" He said,"No, for I have been cured by Allah and I am afraid that this action may spread evil amongst thepeople." Later on the well was filled up with earth.

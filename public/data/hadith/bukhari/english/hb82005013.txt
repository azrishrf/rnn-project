82 | 5 | 13 | Narrated Abu Huraira: We witnessed along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the Khaibar (campaign). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told hiscompanions about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, "This man is from the people of the Fire."When the battle started, the man fought very bravely and received a great number of wounds and gotcrippled. On that, a man from among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) came and said, "O Allah'sApostle! Do you know what the man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He hasfought very bravely for Allah's Cause and he has received many wounds." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "But heis indeed one of the people of the Fire." Some of the Muslims were about to have some doubt aboutthat statement. So while the man was in that state, the pain caused by the wounds troubled him somuch that he put his hand into his quiver and took out an arrow and committed suicide with it. Offwent some men from among the Muslims to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah hasmade your statement true. So-and-so has committed suicide." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "O Bilal! Get upand announce in public: None will enter Paradise but a believer, and Allah may support this religion(Islam) with a wicked man."

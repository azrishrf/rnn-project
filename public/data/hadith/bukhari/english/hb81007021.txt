81 | 7 | 21 | Narrated Zahdam bin Mudarrib: `Imran bin Husain said: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The best people are my contemporaries (i.e., the present(my) generation) and then those who come after them (i.e., the next generation)." `Imran added: I amnot sure whether the Prophet (ﷺ) repeated the statement twice after his first saying. The Prophet (ﷺ) added,"And after them there will come people who will bear witness, though they will not be asked to givetheir witness; and they will be treacherous and nobody will trust them, and they will make vows, butwill not fulfill them, and fatness will appear among them."

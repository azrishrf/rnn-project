10 | 30 | 43 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "The reward of the prayer offered by a person in congregation is twenty fivetimes greater than that of the prayer offered in one's house or in the market (alone). And this isbecause if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque with the soleintention of praying, then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree inreward and his one sin is taken off (crossed out) from his accounts (of deeds). When he offers hisprayer, the angels keep on asking Allah's Blessings and Allah's forgiveness for him as long as he is(staying) at his Musalla. They say, 'O Allah! Bestow Your blessings upon him, be Merciful and kindto him.' And one is regarded in prayer as long as one is waiting for the prayer."

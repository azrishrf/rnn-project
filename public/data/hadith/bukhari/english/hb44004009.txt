44 | 4 | 9 | Narrated `Umar bin Al-Khattab: I heard Hisham bin Hakim bin Hizam reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way different to that of mine.Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had taught it to me (in a different way). So, I was about to quarrel with him (duringthe prayer) but I waited till he finished, then I tied his garment round his neck and seized him by it andbrought him to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, "I have heard him reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way differentto the way you taught it to me." The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered me to release him and asked Hisham to recite it.When he recited it, Allah s Apostle said, "It was revealed in this way." He then asked me to recite it.When I recited it, he said, "It was revealed in this way. The Qur'an has been revealed in sevendifferent ways, so recite it in the way that is easier for you."

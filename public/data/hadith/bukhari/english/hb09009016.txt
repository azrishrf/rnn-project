9 | 9 | 16 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "In very hot weather delay the Zuhr prayer till it becomes (a bit) cooler because theseverity of heat is from the raging of the Hell-fire. The Hell-fire of Hell complained to its Lord saying:O Lord! My parts are eating (destroying) one another. So Allah allowed it to take two breaths, one inthe winter and the other in the summer. The breath in the summer is at the time when you feel theseverest heat and the breath in the winter is at the time when you feel the severest cold."

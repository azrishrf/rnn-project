78 | 108 | 216 | Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab: That when his grandfather, Hazn visited the Prophet (ﷺ) the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "What is your name?" He said, "My name is Hazn." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, " But you are Sahl." He said, "I will not change my name with which my father named me." Ibn Al-Musaiyab added: So we have had roughness (in character) ever since.

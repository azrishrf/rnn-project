92 | 26 | 69 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said. "While I was sleeping, I saw myself (in a dream) performing Tawaf around theKa`ba. Behold, I saw a reddish-white man with lank hair, and water was dropping from his head. Iasked, "Who is this?' They replied, 'The son of Mary.' Then I turned my face to see another man witha huge body, red complexion and curly hair and blind in one eye. His eye looked like a protruding outgrape. They said (to me), He is Ad-Dajjal." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "The man he resembled most is IbnQatan, a man from the tribe of Khuza`a. "

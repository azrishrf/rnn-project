51 | 23 | 38 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: I sold a camel to the Prophet (ï·º) on one of the journeys. When we reached Medina, he ordered me to goto the Mosque and offer two rak`at. Then he weighed for me (the price of the camel in gold) and gavean extra amount over it. A part of it remained with me till it was taken by the army of Sham on the dayof Harra."

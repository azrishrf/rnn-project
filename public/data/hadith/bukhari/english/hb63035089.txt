63 | 35 | 89 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: I never heard `Umar saying about something that he thought it would be so-and-so, but he was quiteright. Once, while `Umar was sitting, a handsome man passed by him, `Umar said, "If I am not wrong,this person is still on his religion of the pre-lslamic period of ignorance or he was their foreteller. Callthe man to me." When the man was called to him, he told him of his thought. The man said, "I havenever seen such a day on which a Muslim is faced with such an accusation." `Umar said, "I amdetermined that you should tell me the truth." He said, "I was a foreteller in the pre-lslamic period ofignorance." Then `Umar said, "Tell me the most astonishing thing your female Jinn has told you of."He said, "One-day while I was in the market, she came to me scared and said, 'Haven't you seen theJinns and their despair and they were overthrown after their defeat (and prevented from listening tothe news of the heaven) so that they (stopped going to the sky and) kept following camel-riders (i.e.'Arabs)?" `Umar said, "He is right." and added, "One day while I was near their idols, there came aman with a calf and slaughtered it as a sacrifice (for the idols). An (unseen) creature shouted at him,and I have never heard harsher than his voice. He was crying, 'O you bold evil-doer! A matter ofsuccess! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except you (O Allah).' Onthat the people fled, but I said, 'I shall not go away till I know what is behind this.' Then the cry cameagain: 'O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to beworshipped except Allah.' I then went away and a few days later it was said, "A prophet hasappeared."

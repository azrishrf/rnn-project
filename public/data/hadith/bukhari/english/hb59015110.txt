59 | 15 | 110 | Narrated `Uqba bin `Umar and Abu Mas`ud: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) pointed with his hand towards Yemen and said, "True Belief is Yemenite yonder (i.e.the Yemenite, had True Belief and embraced Islam readily), but sternness and mercilessness are thequalities of those who are busy with their camels and pay no attention to the Religion where the twosides of the head of Satan will appear. Such qualities belong to the tribe of Rabi`a and Mudar."

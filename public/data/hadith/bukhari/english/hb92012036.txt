92 | 12 | 36 | Narrated Abu Al-Aswad: An army unit was being recruited from the people of Medina and my name was written among them.Then I met `Ikrima, and when I informed him about it, he discouraged me very strongly and said, "Ibn`Abbas told me that there were some Muslims who were with the pagans to increase their numberagainst Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (and the Muslim army) so arrows (from the Muslim army) would hit one ofthem and kill him or a Muslim would strike him (with his sword) and kill him. So Allah revealed:--'Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by stayingamong the disbelievers).' (4.97)

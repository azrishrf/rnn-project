He guides whom he will to a straight path'."(2:142) A man prayed with the Prophet (facing the Ka`ba) and went out. He saw some of the Ansarpraying the `Asr prayer with their faces towards Baitul-Maqdis, he said, "I bear witness that I prayedwith Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) facing the Ka`ba." So all the people turned their faces towards the Ka`ba.

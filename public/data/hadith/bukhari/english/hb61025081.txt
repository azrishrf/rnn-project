61 | 25 | 81 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud: Sa`d bin Mu`adh came to Mecca with the intention of performing `Umra, and stayed at the house ofUmaiya bin Khalaf Abi Safwan, for Umaiya himself used to stay at Sa`d's house when he passed byMedina on his way to Sham. Umaiya said to Sa`d, "Will you wait till midday when the people are (attheir homes), then you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka`ba?" So, while Sa`d was goingaround the Ka`ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, "Who is that who is performing Tawaf?" Sa`d replied, "Iam Sa`d." Abu Jahl said, "Are you circumambulating the Ka`ba safely although you have given refugeto Muhammad and his companions?" Sa`d said, "Yes," and they started quarreling. Umaiya said toSa`d, "Don't shout at Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca)." Sa`d thensaid (to Abu Jahl). 'By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka`ba, I will spoilyour trade with Sham." Umaiya kept on saying to Sa`d, "Don't raise your voice." and kept on takinghold of him. Sa`d became furious and said, (to Umaiya), "Be away from me, for I have heardMuhammad saying that he will kill you." Umaiiya said, "Will he kill me?" Sa`d said, "Yes,." Umaiyasaid, "By Allah! When Muhammad says a thing, he never tells a lie." Umaiya went to his wife andsaid to her, "Do you know what my brother from Yathrib (i.e. Medina) has said to me?" She said,"What has he said?" He said, "He claims that he has heard Muhammad claiming that he will kill me."She said, By Allah! Muhammad never tells a lie." So when the infidels started to proceed for Badr(Battle) and declared war (against the Muslims), his wife said to him, "Don't you remember what yourbrother from Yathrib told you?" Umaiya decided not to go but Abu Jahl said to him, "You are fromthe nobles of the valley (of Mecca), so you should accompany us for a day or two." He went with themand thus Allah got him killed.

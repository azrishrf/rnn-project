67 | 122 | 180 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: We were with the Prophet (ﷺ) in Ghazwa, and when we returned and approached Medina, I wanted tohurry while riding a slow camel. A rider overtook me and pricked my camel with a spear which hehad, whereupon my camel started running as fast as any other fast camel you may see. I looked back,and behold, the rider was Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I am newly married " He asked,"Have you got married?" I replied, "Yes." He said, "A virgin or a matron?" I replied, "(Not a virgin)but a matron" He said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you could play with her and shewith you?" When we reached (near Medina) and were going to enter it, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Wait tillyou enter your home early in the night so that the lady whose hair is unkempt may comb her hair andthat the lady whose husband has been away may shave her pubic hair."

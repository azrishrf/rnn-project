He said, "Take aperfumed piece of cloth and clean yourself with it." She said,' "How shall I clean myself with it, OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Clean yourself" She said again, "How shall I clean myself, OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Clean yourself with it." Then I knew what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)meant.

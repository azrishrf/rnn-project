82 | 14 | 25 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Ibn Saiyad, "I have kept for you a secret." Ibn Saiyad said, "Ad-Dukh." TheProphet said, "Keep quiet, for you cannot go beyond your limits (or you cannot exceed what has beenforeordained for you)." On that, `Umar said (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ), "Allow me to chop off his neck!" TheProphet said, "Leave him, for if he is he (i.e., Ad-Dajjal), then you will not be able to overcome him,and if he is not, then you gain no good by killing him."

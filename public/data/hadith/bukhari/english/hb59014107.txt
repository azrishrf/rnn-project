59 | 14 | 107 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: That he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) delivering a sermon on the pulpit saying, "Kill snakes and kill Dhu-at-Tufyatain (i.e. a snake with two white lines on its back) and ALBATROSS (i.e. a snake with short ormutilated tail) for they destroy the sight of one's eyes and bring about abortion." (`Abdullah bin `Umarfurther added): Once while I was chasing a snake in order, to kill it, Abu Lubaba called me saying:"Don't kill it," I said. "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill snakes." He said, "But later on he prohibitedthe killing of snakes living in the houses." (Az-Zuhri said. "Such snakes are called Al-Awamir.")

10 | 36 | 56 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "The angels keep on asking for Allah's Blessing and Forgiveness for anyone ofyou as long as he is at his Musalla (praying place) and does not do Hadath (passes wind). The angelssay, 'O Allah! Forgive him and be Merciful to him.' Each one of you is in the prayer as long as he iswaiting for the prayer and nothing but the prayer detains him from going to his family."

63 | 11 | 27 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) (in his fatal illness) came out wrapped in a sheet covering his shoulders and his headwas tied with an oily tape of cloth till he sat on the pulpit, and after praising and glorifying Allah, hesaid, "Then-after, O people! The people will go on increasing, but the Ansar will go on decreasing tillthey become just like salt in a meal. So whoever amongst you will be the ruler and have the power toharm or benefit others, should accept the good of the good-doers amongst them and excuse the wrongdoersamongst them."

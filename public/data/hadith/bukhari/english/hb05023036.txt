5 | 23 | 36 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) came across me in one of the streets of Medina and at that time I was Junub. So I slippedaway from him and went to take a bath. On my return the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Abu Huraira! Where haveyou been?" I replied, "I was Junub, so I disliked to sit in your company." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "SubhanAllah! A believer never becomes impure."

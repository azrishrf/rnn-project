62 | 12 | 63 | Narrated 'Aisha: Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her herinheritance from the Prophet (ﷺ) from what Allah had given to His Apostlethrough Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for theSadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet (ﷺ)at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e.,one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said,'We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leaveis Sadaqa, but Muhammad's Family can eat from this property, i.e.Allah's property, but they have no right to take more than the foodthey need.' By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with theSadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observedin his (i.e. the Prophet's) life-time, and I will dispose with it asAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do," Then 'Ali said, "I testify that None hasthe right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is HisApostle," and added, "O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority."Then he (i.e. 'Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah'sApostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, "By Allah inWhose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah'sApostle rather than to my own relatives"

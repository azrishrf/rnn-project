53 | 7 | 11 | Narrated Ibn `Umar: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) set out for the `Umra but the pagans of Quraish prevented him from reaching theKa`ba. So, he slaughtered his sacrifice and got his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with themthat he would perform `Umra the following year and would not carry weapons except swords andwould not stay in Mecca except for the period they allowed. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) performed the `Umra inthe following year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he stayed for three days, thepagans ordered him to depart, and he departed.

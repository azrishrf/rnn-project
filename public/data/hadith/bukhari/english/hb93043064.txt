93 | 43 | 64 | Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: The group of people whom `Umar had selected as candidates for the Caliphate gathered and consultedeach other. `Abdur-Rahman said to them, "I am not going to compete with you in this matter, but ifyou wish, I would select for you a caliph from among you."So all of them agreed to let `Abdur-Rahman decide the case. So when the candidates placed the casein the hands of `Abdur-Rahman, the people went towards him and nobody followed the rest of thegroup nor obeyed any after him. So the people followed `Abdur-Rahman and consulted him all thosenights till there came the night we gave the oath of allegiance to `Uthman. Al-Miswar (bin Makhrama)added: `Abdur-Rahman called on me after a portion of the night had passed and knocked on my doortill I got up, and he said to me, "I see you have been sleeping! By Allah, during the last three nights Ihave not slept enough. Go and call Az-Zubair and Sa`d.'So I called them for him and he consulted them and then called me saying, 'Call `Ali for me." I called`Ali and he held a private talk with him till very late at night, and then 'Al, got up to leave having hadmuch hope (to be chosen as a Caliph) but `Abdur-Rahman was afraid of something concerning `Ali.`Abdur-Rahman then said to me, "Call `Uthman for me." I called him and he kept on speaking to himprivately till the Mu'adh-dhin put an end to their talk by announcing the Adhan for the Fajr prayer.When the people finished their morning prayer and that (six men) group gathered near the pulpit,`Abdur-Rahman sent for all the Muhajirin (emigrants) and the Ansar present there and sent for thearmy chief who had performed the Hajj with `Umar that year. When all of them had gathered, `Abdur-Rahman said, "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah," and added, "Now then, O `Ali, I havelooked at the people's tendencies and noticed that they do not consider anybody equal to `Uthman, soyou should not incur blame (by disagreeing)." Then `Abdur-Rahman said (to `Uthman), "I gave theoath of allegiance to you on condition that you will follow Allah's Laws and the traditions of Allah'sApostle and the traditions of the two Caliphs after him." So `Abdur-Rahman gave the oath ofallegiance to him, and so did the people including the Muhajirin (emigrants) and the Ansar and thechiefs of the army staff and all the Muslims.

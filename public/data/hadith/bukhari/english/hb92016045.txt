92 | 16 | 45 | Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair: `Abdullah bin `Umar came to us and we hoped that he would narrate to us a good Hadith. But beforewe asked him, a man got up and said to him, "O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! Narrate to us about the battlesduring the time of the afflictions, as Allah says:--'And fight them until there is no more afflictions (i.e. no more worshipping of others besides Allah).'"(2.193) Ibn `Umar said (to the man), "Do you know what is meant by afflictions? Let your motherbereave you! Muhammad used to fight against the pagans, for a Muslim was put to trial in his religion(The pagans will either kill him or chain him as a captive). His fighting was not like your fightingwhich is carried on for the sake of ruling."

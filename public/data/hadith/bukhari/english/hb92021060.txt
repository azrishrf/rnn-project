92 | 21 | 60 | Narrated Abu Al-Minhal: When Ibn Ziyad and Marwan were in Sham and Ibn Az-Zubair took over the authority in Mecca andQurra' (the Kharijites) revolted in Basra, I went out with my father to Abu Barza Al-Aslami till weentered upon him in his house while he was sitting in the shade of a room built of cane. So we sat withhim and my father started talking to him saying, "O Abu Barza! Don't you see in what dilemma thepeople has fallen?" The first thing heard him saying "I seek reward from Allah for myself because ofbeing angry and scornful at the Quraish tribe. O you Arabs! You know very well that you were inmisery and were few in number and misguided, and that Allah has brought you out of all that withIslam and with Muhammad till He brought you to this state (of prosperity and happiness) which yousee now; and it is this worldly wealth and pleasures which has caused mischief to appear among you.The one who is in Sham (i.e., Marwan), by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain:and those who are among you, by Allah, are not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain; and thatone who is in Mecca (i.e., Ibn Az-Zubair) by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldlygain."

43 | 3 | 4 | Narrated Abu Dhar: Once, while I was in the company of the Prophet, he saw the mountain of Uhud and said, "I would notlike to have this mountain turned into gold for me unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remainsof it with me for more than three days (i.e. I will spend all of it in Allah's Cause), except that Dinarwhich I will keep for repaying debts." Then he said, "Those who are rich in this world would havelittle reward in the Hereafter except those who spend their money here and there (in Allah's Cause),and they are few in number." Then he ordered me to stay at my place and went not far away. I heard avoice and intended to go to him but I remembered his order, "Stay at your place till I return." On hisreturn I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ï·º)! (What was) that noise which I heard?" He said, "Did you hearanything?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Gabriel came and said to me, 'Whoever amongst your followersdies, worshipping none along with Allah, will enter Paradise.' " I said, "Even if he did such-and-suchthings (i.e. even if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse)" He said, "Yes."

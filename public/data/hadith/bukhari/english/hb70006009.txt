70 | 6 | 9 | Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr: We were one hundred and thirty men sitting with the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Have anyone of youany food with him?" It happened that one man had one Sa of wheat flour (or so) which was turnedinto dough then. After a while a tall lanky pagan came, driving some sheep. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, 'Willyou sell us (a sheep), or give (it to) us as a gift?" The pagan said, "No, but I will sell it " So theProphet bought from him a sheep which was slaughtered, and then the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that the liver,the kidneys, lungs and heart, etc., of that sheep be roasted. By Allah, none of those one hundred andthirty men but had his share of those things. The Prophet (ﷺ) gave to those who were present, and alsokept a share for those who were absent He then served that cooked sheep in two big trays and we allate together our fill; yet there remained a part of it in those two trays which I carried on the camel.

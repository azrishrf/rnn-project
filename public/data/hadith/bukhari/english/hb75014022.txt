75 | 14 | 22 | Narrated `Abdullah: I visited the Prophet (ï·º) during his illness and touched him while he was having a fever. I said to him,"You have a high fever; is it because you will get a double reward?" He said, "Yes. No Muslim isafflicted with any harm, but that his sins will be annulled as the leave of a tree fall down."

11 | 29 | 47 | Narrated `Amr bin Taghlib: Some property or something was brought to Allah's Messenger (ï·º) and he distributed it. He gave to somemen and ignored the others. Later he got the news of his being admonished by those whom he hadignored. So he glorified and praised Allah and said, "Amma ba'du. By Allah, I may give to a man andignore another, although the one whom I ignore is more beloved to me than the one whom I give. ButI give to some people as I feel that they have no patience and no contentment in their hearts and Ileave those who are patient and self-content with the goodness and wealth which Allah has put intotheir hearts and `Amr bin Taghlib is one of them." `Amr added, By Allah! Those words of Allah'sApostle are more beloved to me than the best red camels.

43 | 18 | 21 | Narrated Jabir: (On another occasion) I took part in one of Ghazawat among with the Prophet (ﷺ) and I was riding one ofour camels. The camel got tired and was lagging behind the others. The Prophet (ﷺ) hit it on its back. Hesaid, "Sell it to me, and you have the right to ride it till Medina.'' When we approached Medina, I tookthe permission from the Prophet (ﷺ) to go to my house, saying, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have newlymarried." The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, "Have you married a virgin or a matron (a widow or divorcee)?" I said,"I have married a matron, as `Abdullah (my father) died and left behind daughters small in their ages,so I married a matron who may teach them and bring them up with good manners." The Prophet (ﷺ) thensaid (to me), "Go to your family." When I went there and told my maternal uncle about the selling ofthe camel, he admonished me for it. On that I told him about its slowness and exhaustion and aboutwhat the Prophet (ﷺ) had done to the camel and his hitting it. When the Prophet (ﷺ) arrived, I went to himwith the camel in the morning and he gave me its price, the camel itself, and my share from the warbooty as he gave the other people.

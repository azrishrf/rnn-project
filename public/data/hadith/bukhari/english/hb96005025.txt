I said, "If Abu Bakr stood at your place (in prayers, the people will not be able tohear him because of his weeping, so order `Umar to lead the people in prayer." He again said, "OrderAbu Bakr to lead the people in prayer " Then I said to Hafsa, "Will you say (to the Prophet), 'If AbuBakr stood at your place, the people will not be able to hear him be cause of his weeping, so order`Umar to lead the people in prayer?" Hafsa did so, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "You are like thecompanions of Joseph (See Qur'an, 12:30-32). Order Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer." Hafsathen said to me, "I have never received any good from you!"

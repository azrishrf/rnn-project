He said, "Yes, had it not beenfor my close relation to the Prophet, I would not have performed it (with him) because of my beingtoo young The Prophet (ﷺ) came to the mark which is near the home of Kathir bin As-Salt and offered theId prayer and then delivered the sermon. I do not remember if any Adhan or Iqama were pronouncedfor the prayer. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered (the women) to give alms, and they started stretching outtheir hands towards their ears and throats (giving their ornaments in charity), and the Prophet (ﷺ) orderedBilal to go to them (to collect the alms), and then Bilal returned to the Prophet.

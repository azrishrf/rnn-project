93 | 50 | 76 | Narrated Jabir: A bedouin came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "Please take my Pledge of allegiance for Islam." So theProphet took from him the Pledge of allegiance for Islam. He came the next day with a fever and saidto the Prophet (ﷺ) "Cancel my pledge." But the Prophet (ﷺ) refused and when the bedouin went away, theProphet said, "Medina is like a pair of bellows (furnace): It expels its impurities and brightens andclears its good."

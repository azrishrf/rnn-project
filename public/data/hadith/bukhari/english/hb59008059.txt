59 | 8 | 59 | Narrated Abu Huraira: While we were in the company of the Prophet, he said, "While I was asleep, I saw myself in Paradiseand there I beheld a woman making ablution beside a palace, I asked, To whom does this palacebelong? 'They said, To `Umar bin Al-Khattab.' Then I remembered `Umar's Ghaira (concerningwomen), and so I quickly went away from that palace." (When `Umar heard this from the Prophet), hewept and said, "Do you think it is likely that I feel Ghaira because of you, O Allah's Messenger (ï·º)?"

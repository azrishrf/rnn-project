85 | 20 | 32 | Narrated Al-Aswad: `Aisha bought Barira in order to manumit her, but her masters stipulated that her Wala' (after herdeath) would be for them. `Aisha said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have bought Barira in order to manumither, but her masters stipulated that her Wala' will be for them." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Manumit her as theWala is for the one who manumits (the slave)," or said, "The one who pays her price." Then `Aishabought and manumitted her. After that, Barira was given the choice (by the Prophet) (to stay with herhusband or leave him). She said, "If he gave me so much and so much (money) I would not stay withhim." (Al-Aswad added: Her husband was a free man.) The sub-narrator added: The series of thenarrators of Al-Aswad's statement is incomplete. The statement of Ibn `Abbas, i.e., when I saw him hewas a slave, is more authentic.

66 | 36 | 84 | Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: I heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º) saying, "There will appear some people among you whose prayer will makeyou look down upon yours, and whose fasting will make you look down upon yours, but they willrecite the Qur'an which will not exceed their throats (they will not act on it) and they will go out ofIslam as an arrow goes out through the game whereupon the archer would examine the arrowhead butsee nothing, and look at the unfeathered arrow but see nothing, and look at the arrow feathers but seenothing, and finally he suspects to find something in the lower part of the arrow."

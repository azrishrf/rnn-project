34 | 17 | 30 | Narrated Hudhaifa: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "Before your time the angels received the soul of a man and asked him, 'Did you doany good deeds (in your life)?' He replied, 'I used to order my employees to grant time to the richperson to pay his debts at his convenience.' So Allah said to the angels; "Excuse him." Rabi said that(the dead man said), 'I used to be easy to the rich and grant time to the poor.' Or, in another narration,'grant time to the well-off and forgive the needy,' or, 'accept from the well-off and forgive the needy.'

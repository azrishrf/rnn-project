10 | 150 | 230 | Narrated `Abdullah: When we prayed with the Prophet (ﷺ) we used to say, "Peace be on Allah from His slaves and peace be onso and so." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Don't say As-Salam be on Allah, for He Himself is As-Salam, but say,at-tahiyatu li l-lahi wa s-salawatu wa t-taiyibat. As-salamu `alaika aiyuha n-Nabiyu wa rahmatu l-lahiwa barakatuh. As-salamu `alaina wa `ala `ibadi l-lahi s-salihin. (If you say this then it will reach all theslaves in heaven or between heaven and earth). Ash-hadu al la-ilaha illa l-lah, wa ash-hadu annaMuhammadan `Abduhu wa Rasuluh.' Then select the invocation you like best and recite it."

60 | 41 | 99 | Narrated `Abdullah: When the Verse:-- 'Those who believe and mix not their belief with wrong.' was revealed, theMuslims felt it very hard on them and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ï·º)! Who amongst us does not do wrong tohimself?" He replied, "The Verse does not mean this. But that (wrong) means to associate others inworship to Allah: Don't you listen to what Luqman said to his son when he was advising him," O myson! Join not others in worship with Allah. Verily joining others in worship with Allah is a greatwrong indeed." (31.13)

81 | 33 | 82 | Narrated Sa`d bin Sahl As-Sa`idi: The Prophet (ﷺ) looked at a man fighting against the pagans and he was one of the most competentpersons fighting on behalf of the Muslims. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Let him who wants to look at a manfrom the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire, look at this (man)." Another man followed him and kept onfollowing him till he (the fighter) was injured and, seeking to die quickly, he placed the blade tip ofhis sword between his breasts and leaned over it till it passed through his shoulders (i.e., committedsuicide)." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "A person may do deeds that seem to the people as the deeds of thepeople of Paradise while in fact, he is from the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire: and similarly a person maydo deeds that seem to the people as the deeds of the people of the (Hell) Fire while in fact, he is fromthe dwellers of Paradise. Verily, the (results of) deeds done, depend upon the last actions."

8 | 83 | 120 | Narrated Ka`b bin Malik: During the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) I asked Ibn Abi Hadrad in the mosque to pay the debts which heowed to me and our voices grew so loud that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard them while he was in his house. Sohe came to us after raising the curtain of his room. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Ka`b bin Malik!" I replied,"Labaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)." He gestured with his hand to me to reduce the debt to one half. I said, "OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) have done it." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to Ibn Hadrad), "Get up and pay it."

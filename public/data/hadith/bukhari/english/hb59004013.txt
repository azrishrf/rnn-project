59 | 4 | 13 | Narrated Abu Dhar: The Prophet (ï·º) asked me at sunset, "Do you know where the sun goes (at the time of sunset)?" I replied,"Allah and His Apostle know better." He said, "It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates Itself underneaththe Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (a time will come when)it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask permission togo on its course but it will not be permitted, but it will be ordered to return whence it has come and soit will rise in the west. And that is the interpretation of the Statement of Allah: "And the sun Runs itsfixed course For a term (decreed). that is The Decree of (Allah) The Exalted in Might, The All-Knowing." (36.38)

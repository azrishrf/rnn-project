23 | 32 | 53 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: We were (in the funeral procession) of one of the daughters of the Prophet (ï·º) and he was sitting by theside of the grave. I saw his eyes shedding tears. He said, "Is there anyone among you who did nothave sexual relations with his wife last night?" Abu Talha replied in the affirmative. And so theProphet told him to get down in the grave. And so he got down in her grave.

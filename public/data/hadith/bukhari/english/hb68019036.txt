68 | 19 | 36 | Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: The pagans were of two kinds as regards their relationship to theProphet and the Believers. Some of them were those with whom theProphet was at war and used to fight against, and they used to fighthim; the others were those with whom the Prophet (ﷺ) made a treaty, andneither did the Prophet (ﷺ) fight them, nor did they fight him. If a ladyfrom the first group of pagans emigrated towards the Muslims, her handwould not be asked in marriage unless she got the menses and thenbecame clean. When she became clean, it would be lawful for her to getmarried, and if her husband emigrated too before she got married, thenshe would be returned to him. If any slave or female slave emigratedfrom them to the Muslims, then they would be considered free persons(not slaves) and they would have the same rights as given to otheremigrants. The narrator then mentioned about the pagans involved withthe Muslims in a treaty, the same as occurs in Mujahid's narration. Ifa male slave or a female slave emigrated from such pagans as had madea treaty with the Muslims, they would not be returned, but theirprices would be paid (to the pagans).

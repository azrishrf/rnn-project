57 | 10 | 35 | Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari: A bedouin asked the Prophet, "A man may fight for the sake of booty, and another may fight so thathe may be mentioned by the people, and a third may fight to show his position (i.e. bravery); which ofthese regarded as fighting in Allah's Cause?" The Prophet (ï·º) said, "He who fights so that Allah's Word(i.e. Islam) should be superior, fights for Allah's Cause."

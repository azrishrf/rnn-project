34 | 113 | 183 | Narrated `Aun bin Abu Juhaifa: I saw my father buying a slave whose profession was cupping, and ordered that his instruments (ofcupping) be broken. I asked him the reason for doing so. He replied, "Allah's Messenger (ï·º) prohibitedtaking money for blood, the price of a dog, and the earnings of a slave-girl by prostitution; he cursedher who tattoos and her who gets tattooed, the eater of Riba (usury), and the maker of pictures."

45 | 4 | 4 | Narrated Zaid bin Khalid: A man came and asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about picking a lost thing. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Remember thedescription of its container and the string it is tied with, and make public announcement about it forone year. If the owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise, do whatever you like with it." He thenasked, "What about a lost sheep?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "It is for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), orfor the wolf." He further asked, "What about a lost camel?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "It is none of yourconcern. It has its water-container (reservoir) and its feet, and it will reach water and drink it and eatthe trees till its owner finds it."

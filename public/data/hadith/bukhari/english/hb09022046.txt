9 | 22 | 46 | Narrated Abu Musa: My companions, who came with me in the boat and I landed at a place called Baqi [??] Buthan [??] .The Prophet (ﷺ) was in Medina at that time. One of us used to go to the Prophet (ﷺ) by turns every night atthe time of the `Isha prayer. Once I along with my companions went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he was busy insome of his affairs, so the `Isha' prayer was delayed to the middle of the night He then came out andled the people (in prayer). After finishing from the prayer, he addressed the people present theresaying, "Be patient! Don't go away. Have the glad tiding. It is from the blessing of Allah upon youthat none amongst mankind has prayed at this time save you." Or said, "None except you has prayedat this time." Abu Musa added, 'So we returned happily after what we heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ."

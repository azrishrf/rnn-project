Then the soul is breathed into his body. So a man may do deedscharacteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubitbetween him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and so he starts doingdeeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and enters Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deedscharacteristic of the people of Paradise, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit betweenhim and it, and then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of thepeople of the (Hell) Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire."

34 | 32 | 48 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: An Ansari woman said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall I make something for you to siton, as I have a slave who is a carpenter?" He replied, "If you wish." So, she got a pulpit made for him.When it was Friday the Prophet (ﷺ) sat on that pulpit. The date-palm stem near which the Prophet (ﷺ) used todeliver his sermons cried so much so that it was about to burst. The Prophet (ﷺ) came down from thepulpit to the stem and embraced it and it started groaning like a child being persuaded to stop cryingand then it stopped crying. The Prophet (ﷺ) said,"It has cried because of (missing) what it use to hear ofthe religions knowledge."

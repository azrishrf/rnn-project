57 | 15 | 40 | Narrated Abu Musa: We got the news of the migration of the Prophet (ﷺ) while we were in Yemen, so we set out migrating tohim. We were, I and my two brothers, I being the youngest, and one of my brothers was Abu Burdaand the other was Abu Ruhm. We were over fifty (or fifty-three or fifty two) men from our people.We got on board a ship which took us to An-Najashi in Ethiopia, and there we found Ja`far bin AbuTalib and his companions with An-Najaishi. Ja`far said (to us), "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has sent us here andordered us to stay here, so you too, stay with us." We stayed with him till we all left (Ethiopia) andmet the Prophet (ﷺ) at the time when he had conquered Khaibar. He gave us a share from its booty (orgave us from its booty). He gave only to those who had taken part in the Ghazwa with him. but he didnot give any share to any person who had not participated in Khaibar's conquest except the people ofour ship, besides Ja`far and his companions, whom he gave a share as he did them (i.e. the people ofthe ship).

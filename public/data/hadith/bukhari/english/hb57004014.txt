57 | 4 | 14 | Narrated Safiya: (the wife of the Prophet) That she came to visit Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while he was in I`tikaf (i.e. seclusionin the Mosque during the last ten days of Ramadan). When she got up to return, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got upwith her and accompanied her, and when he reached near the gate of the Mosque close to the door (ofthe house) of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet, two Ansari men passed by them and greeted Allah'sApostle and then went away. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) addressed them saying, "Don't hurry! (She is my wife),"They said, "Glorified be Allah! O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (You are far away from any suspicion)," and hissaying was hard on them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Satan circulates in the mind of a person as blood does(in his body). I was afraid that Satan might put some (evil) thoughts in your minds."

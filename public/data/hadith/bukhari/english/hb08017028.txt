8 | 17 | 28 | Narrated Abu Juhaifa: I saw Allah's Messenger (ï·º) in a red leather tent and I saw Bilal taking the remaining water with which theProphet had performed ablution. I saw the people taking the utilized water impatiently and whoevergot some of it rubbed it on his body and those who could not get any took the moisture from theothers' hands. Then I saw Bilal carrying a short spear (or stick) which he planted in the ground. TheProphet came out tucking up his red cloak, and led the people in prayer and offered two rak`at (facingthe Ka`ba) taking a short spear (or stick) as a Sutra for his prayer. I saw the people and animalspassing in front of him beyond the stick.

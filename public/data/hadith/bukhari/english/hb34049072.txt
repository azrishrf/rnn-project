34 | 49 | 72 | Narrated Abu Huraira Ad-Dausi: Once the Prophet (ﷺ) went out during the day. Neither did he talk to me nor I to him till he reached themarket of Bani Qainuqa and then he sat in the compound of Fatima's house and asked about the smallboy (his grandson Al-Hasan) but Fatima kept the boy in for a while. I thought she was either changinghis clothes or giving the boy a bath. After a while the boy came out running and the Prophet (ﷺ) embracedand kissed him and then said, 'O Allah! Love him, and love whoever loves him.'

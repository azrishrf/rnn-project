72 | 4 | 4 | Narrated Abu Tha`laba Al-Khushani: I said, "O Allah's Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture; Can we takeour meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow andwith my hound that is not trained and with my trained hound. Then what is lawful for me to eat?" Hesaid, "As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils otherthan theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eatout of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah's Name, eat of it. and if you huntsomething with your trained hound after mentioning Allah's Name, eat of it, and if you huntsomething with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it."

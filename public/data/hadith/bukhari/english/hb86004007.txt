86 | 4 | 7 | Narrated As-Sa'ib bin Yazid: We used to strike the drunks with our hands, shoes, clothes (by twisting it into the shape of lashes)during the lifetime of the Prophet, Abu Bakr and the early part of `Umar's caliphate. But during thelast period of `Umar's caliphate, he used to give the drunk forty lashes; and when drunks becamemischievous and disobedient, he used to scourge them eighty lashes.

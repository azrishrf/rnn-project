56 | 110 | 172 | Narrated Mujashi: My brother and I came to the Prophet (ï·º) and I requested him to take the pledge of allegiance from us for migration. He said, "Migration has passed away with its people." I asked, "For what will you take the pledge of allegiance from us then?" He said, "I will take (the pledge) for Islam and Jihad."

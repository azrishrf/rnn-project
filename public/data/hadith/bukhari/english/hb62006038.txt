62 | 6 | 38 | Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: When `Umar was stabbed, he showed signs of agony. Ibn `Abbas, as if intending to encourage `Umar,said to him, "O Chief of the believers! Never mind what has happened to you, for you have been inthe company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and you kept good relations with him and you parted with him whilehe was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of Abu Bakr and kept good relations withhim and you parted with him (i.e. he died) while he was pleased with you. Then you were in thecompany of the Muslims, and you kept good relations with them, and if you leave them, you willleave them while they are pleased with you." `Umar said, (to Ibn "Abbas), "As for what you have saidabout the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his being pleased with me, it is a favor, Allah did to me;and as for what you have said about the company of Abu Bakr and his being pleased with me, it is afavor Allah did to me; and concerning my impatience which you see, is because of you and yourcompanions. By Allah! If (at all) I had gold equal to the earth, I would have ransomed myself with itfrom the Punishment of Allah before I meet Him."

4 | 40 | 55 | Narrated As-Sa'ib bin Yazid: My aunt took me to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This son of my sister has got a diseasein his legs." So he passed his hands on my head and prayed for Allah's blessings for me; then heperformed ablution and I drank from the remaining water. I stood behind him and saw the seal ofProphethood between his shoulders, and it was like the "Zir-al-Hijla" (means the button of a smalltent, but some said 'egg of a partridge.' etc.)

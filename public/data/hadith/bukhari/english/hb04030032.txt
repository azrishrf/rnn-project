4 | 30 | 32 | Narrated `Ubaid Ibn Juraij: I asked `Abdullah bin `Umar, "O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! I saw you doing four things which I neversaw being done by anyone of you companions?" `Abdullah bin `Umar said, "What are those, O IbnJuraij?" I said, "I never saw you touching any corner of the Ka`ba except these (two) facing south(Yemen) and I saw you wearing shoes made of tanned leather and dyeing your hair with Hinna (a kindof red dye). I also noticed that whenever you were in Mecca, the people assume Ihram on seeing thenew moon crescent (1st of Dhul-Hijja) while you did not assume the Ihlal (Ihram) -(Ihram is alsocalled Ihlal which means 'Loud calling' because a Muhrim has to recite Talbiya aloud when assumingthe state of Ihram) - till the 8th of Dhul-Hijja (Day of Tarwiya). `Abdullah replied, "Regarding thecorners of Ka`ba, I never saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) touching except those facing south (Yemen) andregarding the tanned leather shoes, no doubt I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wearing non-hairy shoes and heused to perform ablution while wearing the shoes (i.e. wash his feet and then put on the shoes). So Ilove to wear similar shoes. And about the dyeing of hair with Hinna; no doubt I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)dyeing his hair with it and that is why I like to dye (my hair with it). Regarding Ihlal, I did not seeAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) assuming Ihlal till he set out for Hajj (on the 8th of Dhul-Hijja).

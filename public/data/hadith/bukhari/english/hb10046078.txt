10 | 46 | 78 | Narrated Az-Zuhri: Anas bin Malik Al-Ansari, told me, "Abu Bakr used to lead the people in prayer during the fatalillness of the Prophet (ﷺ) till it was Monday. When the people aligned (in rows) for the prayer the Prophet (ﷺ)lifted the curtain of his house and started looking at us and was standing at that time. His face was(glittering) like a page of the Qur'an and he smiled cheerfully. We were about to be put to trial for thepleasure of seeing the Prophet, Abu Bakr retreated to join the row as he thought that the Prophet (ﷺ)would lead the prayer. The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned us to complete the prayer and he let the curtain fall. On the same day he died."

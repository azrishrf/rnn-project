62 | 2 | 5 | Narrated Al-Bara': Abu Bakr bought a (camel) saddle from `Azib for thirteen Dirhams. Abu Bakr said to `Azib, "Tell Al-Bara' to carry the saddle for me." `Azib said, "No, unless you relate to me what happened to you andAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) when you left Mecca while the pagans were in search of you." Abu Bakr said, "Weleft Mecca and we traveled continuously for that night and the following day till it was midday. Ilooked (around) searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a rock, and found alittle shade there. So I cleaned the place and spread a bed for the Prophet (ﷺ) in the shade and said to him,'Lie down, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).' So the Prophet (ﷺ) lay down and I went out, looking around to see if therewas any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seekingwhat we had already sought from it. I asked him, 'To whom do you belong, O boy?' He said, 'I belongto a man from Quraish.' He named the man and I recognized him. I asked him, 'Is there any milk withyour sheep?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Will you then milk (some) for us?' He said, 'Yes.' Then I asked himto tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands fromdust. Then the shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. After doing so,he milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) a leather water-container, themouth of which was covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container till its lowerpart was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet (ﷺ) whom I found awake. I said to him, 'Drink, OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ).' So he drank till I became pleased. Then I said, 'It is time for us to move, O Allah'sApostle!' He said, 'Yes.' So we set out while the people (i.e. Quraish pagans) were searching for us,but none found us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju`shum who was riding his horse. I said, 'These areour pursuers who have found us. O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!' He said, 'Do not grieve, for Allah is with us."

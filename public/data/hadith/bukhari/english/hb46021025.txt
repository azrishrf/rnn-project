46 | 21 | 25 | Narrated Anas: I was the butler of the people in the house of Abu Talha, and in those days drinks were prepared fromdates. Allah's Messenger (ï·º) ordered somebody to announce that alcoholic drinks had been prohibited. AbuTalha ordered me to go out and spill the wine. I went out and spilled it, and it flowed in the streets ofMedina. Some people said, "Some people were killed and wine was still in their stomachs." On thatthe Divine revelation came:-- "On those who believe And do good deeds There is no blame For whatthey ate (in the past)." (5.93)

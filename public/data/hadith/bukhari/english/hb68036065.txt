68 | 36 | 65 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: Those involved in a case of Lian were mentioned before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) `Asim bin Adi saidsomething about that and then left. Later on a man from his tribe came to him and told him that he hadfound another man with his wife. On that `Asim said, "I have not been put to task except for what Ihave said (about Lian)." `Asim took the man to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he told him of the state in whichhe found his wife. The man was pale, thin and lank-haired, while the other man whom he had foundwith his wife was brown, fat with thick calves and curly hair. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "O Allah! Revealthe truth." Then the lady delivered a child resembling the man whom her husband had mentioned hehad found with her. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered them to carry out Lien. A man from that gathering saidto Ibn `Abbas, "Was she the same lady regarding whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'If I were to stone todeath someone without witnesses, I would have stoned this lady'?" Ibn `Abbas said, "No, that wasanother lady who, though being a Muslim, used to arouse suspicion because of her outrightmisbehavior."

4 | 28 | 30 | Narrated Humran: (the freed slave of `Uthman bin `Affan) I saw `Uthman bin `Affan asking (for a tumbler of water) toperform ablution (and when it was brought) he poured water from it over his hands and washed themthrice and then put his right hand in the water container and rinsed his mouth and washed his nose byputting water in it and then blowing it out. Then he washed his face thrice and (then) forearms up tothe elbows thrice, then passed his wet hands over his head and then washed each foot thrice. After that`Uthman said, "I saw the Prophet (ï·º) performing ablution like this of mine, and he said, 'If anyoneperforms ablution like that of mine and offers a two-rak`at prayer during which he does not think ofanything else (not related to the present prayer) then his past sins will be forgiven.

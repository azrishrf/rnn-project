63 | 10 | 24 | Narrated Abu Huraira: A man came to the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent a messenger to his wives (to bring something for thatman to eat) but they said that they had nothing except water. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Who willtake this (person) or entertain him as a guest?" An Ansar man said, "I." So he took him to his wife andsaid to her, "Entertain generously the guest of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) " She said, "We have got nothing exceptthe meals of my children." He said, "Prepare your meal, light your lamp and let your children sleep ifthey ask for supper." So she prepared her meal, lighted her lamp and made her children sleep, and thenstood up pretending to mend her lamp, but she put it off. Then both of them pretended to be eating,but they really went to bed hungry. In the morning the Ansari went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who said,"Tonight Allah laughed or wondered at your action." Then Allah revealed:"But give them (emigrants) preference over themselves even though they were in need of that Andwhosoever is saved from the covetousness Such are they who will be successful."

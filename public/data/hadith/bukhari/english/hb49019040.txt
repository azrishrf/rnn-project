49 | 19 | 40 | Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar: That he heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for hischarge; the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his familyand responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband's house and responsible for hercharges; and the servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for his charge." Idefinitely heard the above from the Prophet (ﷺ) and think that the Prophet (ﷺ) also said, "A man is a guardianof his father's property and responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian andresponsible for his charges."

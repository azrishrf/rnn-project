62 | 7 | 49 | Narrated Anas: The Prophet (ﷺ) ascended the mountain of Uhud and Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman were accompanyinghim. The mountain gave a shake (i.e. trembled underneath them) . The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Uhud ! Becalm." I think that the Prophet (ﷺ) hit it with his foot, adding, "For upon you there are none but a Prophet,a Siddiq and two martyrs."

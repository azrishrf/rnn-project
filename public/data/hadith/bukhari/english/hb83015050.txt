83 | 15 | 50 | Narrated Jundub: I witnessed the Prophet (ï·º) offering the `Id prayer (and after finishing it) he delivered a sermon and said,"Whoever has slaughtered his sacrifice (before the prayer) should make up for it (i.e. slaughter anotheranimal) and whoever has not slaughtered his sacrifice yet, should slaughter it by mentioning Allah'sName over it."

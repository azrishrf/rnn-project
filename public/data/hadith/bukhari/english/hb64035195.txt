64 | 35 | 195 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi `Aufa: We were in the company of the Prophet (ï·º) when he performed the `Umra. He performed the Tawaf and we did the same; he offered the prayer and we also offered the prayer with him. Then he performed the Sai between Safa and Marwa and we were guarding him against the people of Mecca so that nobody should harm him.

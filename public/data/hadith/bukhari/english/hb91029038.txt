91 | 29 | 38 | Narrated Salim's father: about the Prophet's dream in which he has seen Abu Bakr and `Umar: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "I saw (in adream) that the people had gathered. Then Abu Bakr stood up and pulled out one or two buckets fullof water (from a well) and there was weakness in his pulling -- may Allah forgive him. Then Ibn Al-Khattab stood up, and the bucket turned into a very large one and I have never seen any strong manamong the people doing such a hard job. He pulled out so much water that the people (drank to theirsatisfaction) and watered their camels to their fill, (and then after quenching their thirst) they satbeside the water."

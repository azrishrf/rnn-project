68 | 50 | 89 | Narrated Mujahid: (regarding the Verse): 'If any of you dies and leaves wives behind,' That was the period of the 'Iddahwhich the widow was obliged to spend in the house of the late husband. Then Allah revealed: Andthose of you who die and leave wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance andresidence without turning them out, but if they leave, there is no blame on you for what they do ofthemselves, provided it is honorable (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240) Mujahid said: Allah has orderedthat a widow has the right to stay for seven months and twenty days with her husband's relativesthrough her husband's will and testament so that she will complete the period of one year (of 'Iddah).But the widow has the right to stay that extra period or go out of her husband's house as is indicatedby the statement of Allah: 'But if they leave there is no blame on you,... ' (2.240) Ibn `Abbas said: Theabove Verse has cancelled the order of spending the period of the 'Iddah at her late husband's house,and so she could spend her period of the 'Iddah wherever she likes. And Allah says: 'Without turningthem out.' 'Ata said: If she would, she could spend her period of the 'Iddah at her husband's house, andlive there according to her (husband's) will and testament, and if she would, she could go out (of herhusband's house) as Allah says: 'There is no blame on you for what they do of themselves.' (2.240)'Ata added: Then the Verses of inheritance were revealed and the order of residence (for the widow)was cancelled, and she could spend her period of the 'Iddah wherever she would like, and she was nolonger entitled to be accommodated by her husband's family.

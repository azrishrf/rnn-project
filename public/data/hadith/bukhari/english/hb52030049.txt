52 | 30 | 49 | Narrated An-Nu`man bin Bashir: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "The example of the person abiding by Allah's orders and limits (or the one whoabides by the limits and regulations prescribed by Allah) in comparison to the one who do wrong andviolate Allah's limits and orders is like the example of people drawing lots for seats in a boat. Some ofthem got seats in the upper part while the others in the lower part ; those in the, lower part have topass by those in the upper one to get water, and that troubled the latter. One of them (i.e. the people inthe lower part) took an ax and started making a hole in the bottom of the boat. The people of the upperpart came and asked him, (saying), 'What is wrong with you?' He replied, "You have been troubledmuch by my (coming up to you), and I have to get water.' Now if they prevent him from doing thatthey will save him and themselves, but if they leave him (to do what he wants), they will destroy himand themselves."

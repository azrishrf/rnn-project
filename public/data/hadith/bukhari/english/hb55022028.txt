I have some property which I prize highly and I wantto give it in charity." The Prophet; said, "Give it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) with its land andtrees on the condition that the land and trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, norbequeathed, but the fruits are to be spent in charity." So `Umar gave it in charity, and it was forAllah's Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the poor, for guests, for travelers, and for kinsmen. Theperson acting as its administrator could eat from it reasonably and fairly, and could let a friend of hiseat from it provided he had no intention of becoming wealthy by its means.

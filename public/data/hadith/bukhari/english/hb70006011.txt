70 | 6 | 11 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, "I have heard the voice of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which was feeble, and Ithink that he is hungry. Have you got something (to eat)?" She took out some loaves of barley bread,then took her face-covering sheet and wrapped the bread in part of it, and pushed it under my garmentand turned the rest of it around my body and sent me to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . I went with that, and foundAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) in the mosque with some people. I stood up near them, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked me,"Have you been sent by Abu Talha?" I said, "Yes." He asked, "With some food (for us)?" I said,"Yes." Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to all those who were with him, "Get up!" He set out (and all thepeople accompanied him) and I proceeded ahead of them till I came to Abu Talha. Abu Talha thensaid, "O Um Sulaim! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has arrived along with the people, and we do not have foodenough to feed them all." She said, "Allah and His Apostle know better." So Abu Talha went out tillhe met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Then Abu Talha and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and entered the house. Allah'sApostle said, "Um Sulaim ! Bring whatever you have." She brought that very bread. The Prophet (ﷺ)ordered that it be crushed into small pieces, and Um Sulaim pressed a skin of butter on it. Then Allah'sApostle said whatever Allah wished him to say (to bless the food) and then added, "Admit ten (men)."So they were admitted, ate their fill and went out. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, "Admit ten (more)." Theywere admitted, ate their full, and went out. He then again said, "Admit ten more!" They wereadmitted, ate their fill, and went out. He admitted ten more, and so all those people ate their fill, andthey were eighty men.

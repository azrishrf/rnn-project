77 | 52 | 92 | Narrated Anas bin Malik: When the Prophet (ﷺ) intended to write to the Byzantines, it was said to him, "Those people do notread your letter unless it is stamped." So the Prophet (ﷺ) took a silver ring and got 'Muhammad, theApostle of Allah' engraved on it .... as if I am now looking at its glitter in his hand.

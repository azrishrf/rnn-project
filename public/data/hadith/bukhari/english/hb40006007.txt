40 | 6 | 7 | Narrated Abu Huraira: A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) demanding his debts and behaved rudely. The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ)intended to harm him, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (to them), "Leave him, for the creditor (i.e. owner of aright) has the right to speak." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, "Give him a camel of the same age as that ofhis." The people said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! There is only a camel that is older than his." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)said, "Give (it to) him, for the best amongst you is he who pays the rights of others handsomely."

10 | 13 | 19 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "The Adhan pronounced by Bilal should not stop you from taking Suhur, for hepronounces the Adhan at night, so that the one offering the late night prayer (Tahajjud) from amongyou might hurry up and the sleeping from among you might wake up. It does not mean that dawn ormorning has started." Then he (the Prophet) pointed with his fingers and raised them up (towards thesky) and then lowered them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas`ud imitated the gesture of theProphet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he put on each other and then stretchedthem to the right and left. These gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and righthorizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers down is not the real dawn) .

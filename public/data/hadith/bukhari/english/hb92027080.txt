He will encamp in one of the salt areas neighboring Medina and there will appear to him aman who will be the best or one of the best of the people. He will say 'I testify that you are Ad-Dajjalwhose story Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has told us.' Ad-Dajjal will say (to his audience), 'Look, if I kill this manand then give him life, will you have any doubt about my claim?' They will reply, 'No,' Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and then will make him alive. The man will say, 'By Allah, now I recognizeyou more than ever!' Ad-Dajjal will then try to kill him (again) but he will not be given the power todo so."

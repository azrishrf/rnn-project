'Umar said to him,"Haven't I been told that you do certain jobs for the people but whenyou are given payment you refuse to take it?" 'Abdullah added: I said,"Yes." 'Umar said, "Why do you do so?" I said, "I have horses andslaves and I am living in prosperity and I wish that my payment shouldbe kept as a charitable gift for the Muslims." 'Umar said, "Do not doso, for I intended to do the same as you do. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)s used togive me gifts and I used to say to him, 'Give it to a more needy onethan me.' Once he gave me some money and I said, 'Give it to a moreneedy person than me,' whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Take it and keepit in your possession and then give it in charity. Take what evercomes to you of this money if you are not keen to have it and notasking for it; otherwise (i.e., if it does not come to you) do notseek to have it yourself.' "

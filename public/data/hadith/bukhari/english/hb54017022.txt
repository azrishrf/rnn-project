54 | 17 | 22 | Narrated `Amra: Aisha said that Buraira came to seek her help in the writing of her emancipation. `Aisha said to her,"If you wish, I will pay your masters (your price) and the wala' will be for me." When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)came, she told him about it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to her, "Buy her (i.e. Buraira) and manumit her, for theWala is for the one who manumits." Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ascended the pulpit and said, "What aboutthose people who stipulate conditions which are not in Allah's Laws? Whoever stipulates suchconditions as are not in Allah's Laws, then those conditions are invalid even if he stipulated a hundredsuch conditions."

79 | 30 | 41 | Narrated Abu Dhar: While I was walking with the Prophet (ﷺ) at the Hurra of Medina in the evening, the mountain of Uhudappeared before us. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "O Abu Dhar! I would not like to have gold equal to Uhud(mountain) for me, unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of it with me, for more thanone day or three days, except that single Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts. I will spend all ofit (the whole amount) among Allah's slaves like this and like this and like this." The Prophet (ﷺ) pointedout with his hand to illustrate it and then said, "O Abu Dhar!" I replied, "Labbaik wa Sa`daik, OAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)!" He said, "Those who have much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (inthe Hereafter) except those who do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity)." Then heordered me, "Remain at your place and do not leave it, O Abu Dhar, till I come back." He went awaytill he disappeared from me. Then I heard a voice and feared that something might have happened toAllah's Messenger (ﷺ), and I intended to go (to find out) but I remembered the statement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)that I should not leave, my place, so I kept on waiting (and after a while the Prophet (ﷺ) came), and I saidto him, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), I heard a voice and I was afraid that something might have happened toyou, but then I remembered your statement and stayed (there). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "That was Gabrielwho came to me and informed me that whoever among my followers died without joining others inworship with Allah, would enter Paradise." I said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Even if he had committedillegal sexual intercourse and theft?" He said, "Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse andtheft."

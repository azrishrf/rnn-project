39 | 5 | 9 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he would ask, "Has he left anything torepay his debt?" If he was informed that he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer hisfuneral prayer, otherwise he would tell the Muslims to offer their friend's funeral prayer. When Allahmade the Prophet (ﷺ) wealthy through conquests, he said, "I am more rightful than other believers to bethe guardian of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible for the repayment ofhis debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his death) it will belong to his heirs. "

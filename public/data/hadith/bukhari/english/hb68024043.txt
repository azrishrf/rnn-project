68 | 24 | 43 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi A'ufa: We were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on a journey, and when the sun set, he said to a man, "Get down andprepare a drink of Sawiq for me." The man said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Will you wait till it is evening?"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) again said, "Get down and prepare a drink of Sawiq." The man said, "O Allah'sApostle! Will you wait till it is evening, for it is still daytime. " The Prophet (ﷺ) again said, "Get downand prepare a drink of Sawiq." So the third time the man got down and prepared a drink of sawiq forhim. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) drank thereof and pointed with his hand towards the East, saying, "When you seethe night falling from this side, then a fasting person should break his fast."

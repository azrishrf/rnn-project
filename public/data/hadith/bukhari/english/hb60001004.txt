60 | 1 | 4 | Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "The first group of people who will enter Paradise, will be glittering like the fullmoon and those who will follow them, will glitter like the most brilliant star in the sky. They will noturinate, relieve nature, spit, or have any nasal secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweatwill smell like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their centers. Their wives will be houris. All ofthem will look alike and will resemble their father Adam (in stature), sixty cubits tall."

61 | 1 | 3 | Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "The tribe of Quraish has precedence over the people in this connection (i.e the rightof ruling). The Muslims follow the Muslims amongst them, and the infidels follow the infidelsamongst them. People are of different natures: The best amongst them in the pre-lslamic period are thebest in Islam provided they comprehend the religious knowledge. You will find that the best amongstthe people in this respect (i.e. of ruling) is he who hates it (i.e. the idea of ruling) most, till he is giventhe pledge of allegiance."

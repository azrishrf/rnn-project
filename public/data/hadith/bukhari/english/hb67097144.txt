During one of his journeys the lot fell on `Aisha and Hafsa.When night fell the Prophet (ﷺ) would ride beside `Aisha and talk with her. One night Hafsa said to`Aisha, "Won't you ride my camel tonight and I ride yours, so that you may see (me) and I see (you)(in new situation)?" `Aisha said, "Yes, (I agree.)" So `Aisha rode, and then the Prophet (ﷺ) came towards`Aisha's camel on which Hafsa was riding. He greeted Hafsa and then proceeded (beside her) till theydismounted (on the way). `Aisha missed him, and so, when they dismounted, she put her legs in theIdhkhir and said, "O Lord (Allah)! Send a scorpion or a snake to bite me for I am not to blame him(the Prophet (ﷺ) ).

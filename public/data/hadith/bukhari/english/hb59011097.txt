59 | 11 | 97 | Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ï·º) said, "If anyone of you, when having sexual relation with his wife, say: 'In the name ofAllah. O Allah! Protect us from Satan and prevent Satan from approaching our offspring you aregoing to give us,' and if he begets a child (as a result of that relation) Satan will not harm it."

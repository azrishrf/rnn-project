28 | 2 | 1 | Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu Qatada: My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his companions assumed Ihram, but hedid not. At that time the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet (ﷺ)proceeded onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them laughed amongthemselves. (My father said), "I looked up and saw an onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I thensought my companions' help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its meat. We were afraidthat we might be left behind (separated) from the Prophet (ﷺ) so I went in search of the Prophet (ﷺ) and mademy horse to run at a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at other times till Imet a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him, "Where did you leave the Prophet (ﷺ)?" He replied, "I left him at Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. Ifollowed the trace and joined the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Your people (companions)send you their compliments, and (ask for) Allah's Blessings upon you. They are afraid lest they maybe left behind; so please wait for them.' I added, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I hunted an onager and some ofits meat is with me. The Prophet (ﷺ) told the people to eat it though all of them were in the state ofIhram."

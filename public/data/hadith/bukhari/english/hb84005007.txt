84 | 5 | 7 | Narrated Nafi`: Ibn `Umar used to give the Zakat of Ramadan (Zakat-al-Fitr) according to the Mudd of the Prophet,the first Mudd, and he also used to give things for expiation for oaths according to the Mudd of theProphet. Abu Qutaiba said, "Malik said to us, 'Our Mudd (i.e., of Medina) is better than yours and wedo not see any superiority except in the Mudd of the Prophet!' Malik further said, to me, 'If a rulercame to you and fixed a Mudd smaller than the one of the Prophet, by what Mudd would you measurewhat you give (for expiation or Zakat-al-Fitr?' I replied, 'We would give it according to the Mudd ofthe Prophet' On that, Malik said, 'Then, don't you see that we have to revert to the Mudd of theProphet ultimately?'"

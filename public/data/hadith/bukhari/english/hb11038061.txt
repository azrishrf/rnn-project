11 | 38 | 61 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: While we were praying (Jumua Khutba & prayer) with the Prophet (p.b.u.h), some camels loaded withfood, arrived (from Sham). The people diverted their attention towards the camels (and left themosque), and only twelve persons remained with the Prophet. So this verse was revealed: "But whenthey see Some bargain or some amusement, They disperse headlong to it, And leave you standing."(62.11)

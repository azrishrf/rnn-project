10 | 8 | 12 | Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Whoever after listening to the Adhan says, 'Allahumma Rabba hadhihi-dda`watit-tammah, was-salatil qa'imah, ati Muhammadan al-wasilata wal-fadilah, wa b`ath-humaqaman mahmudan-il-ladhi wa`adtahu' [O Allah! Lord of this perfect call (perfect by not ascribingpartners to You) and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the rightof intercession and illustriousness, and resurrect him to the best and the highest place in Paradise thatYou promised him (of)], then my intercession for him will be allowed on the Day of Resurrection".

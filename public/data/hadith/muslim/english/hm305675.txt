30|5675|  Chapter: The finality of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Abu Hurairh reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The similitude of  mine and that of the Apostles before me is that of a person who built a house quite imposing and  beautiful,  but  for  one  brick  in  one  of  its  corners.  People  would  go  round  it,  appreciating  the  building, but saying: Why has the brick not been fixed here? He said: I am that brick and I am the  last of the Apostles.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

31|5935|  Chapter: Merits of Sa’d b. Abi Waqqis (Allah be pleased with him).  Sa’d reported: This verse was revealed in relation to six persons and I and Ibn Mas’ud  were amongst them. The polytheists said to him (the Holy Prophet): Do not keep such  persons near you. It was upon this that (this verse was revealed): “Drive not away those  who call upon their Lord morning and evening desiring only His pleasure” (vi. 52).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

31|5899|  Chapter: The excellent qualities of ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Sa’d b. Waqqas reported that Umar sought permission from Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) to visit him when some women of the Quraish were busy in talking  with him and raising their voices above his voice. When ‘Umar sought permission they  stood up and went hurriedly behind the curtain. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) gave him permission smilingly. Thereupon ‘Umar said: Allah’s Messenger, may  Allah keep you happy all your life. Then Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  said: I wonder at these women who were with me and no sooner did they hear your  voice, they immediately went behind the curtain. Thereupon ‘Umar said: Allah’s         Messenger, you have more right that they should fear you. Then Umar (addressing the  women) said: O ye enemies of yourselves, do you fear me and fear not the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him)? They said: Yes, you are harsh and strict as  compared to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Thereupon, Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if satan  would encounter you in the way he would certainly take a different way from that of  yours.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

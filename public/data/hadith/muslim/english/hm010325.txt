1|325|  Chapter: Pertaining to Jesus son of Mary and al-Masib al-Dajjil.  It is narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: I saw near the Ka’bah a man of fair complexion with straight hair,  placing his hands on two persons. Water was flowing from his head or it was trickling  from his head. I asked: Who is he? They said: He is Jesus son of Mary or al-Masih son  of Mary. The narrator) says: I do not remember which word it was. He (the Holy  Prophet) said: And I saw behind him a man with red complexion and thick curly hair,  blind in the right eye. I saw in him the greatest resemblance with Ibn Qitan I asked: Who  is he? They replied: It is al-Masih al-Dajjal.

20|4569|  Chapter: Justification for hating the Amirs for violating the laws of the Shari’ah.  It has been narrated on the authority of Umm Salama that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: In the near future there will be Amirs and you will like their  good deeds and dislike their bad deeds. One who sees through their bad deeds (and  tries to prevent their repetition by his band or through his speech), is absolved from  blame, but one who hates their bad deeds (in the heart of his heart, being unable to  prevent their recurrence by his hand or his tongue), is (also) face (so far as God’s wrath  is concerned). But one who approves of their bad deeds and imitates them is spiritually  ruined. People asked (the Holy Prophet): Shouldn’t we fight against them? He replied:  No, as long as they say their prayers.

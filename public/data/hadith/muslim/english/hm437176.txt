43|7176|  Chapter: Not known.  Ibn Abbas reported that some Muslims met a person with a small flock of sheep. He  said: As-Salam-o-‘Alaikum. They caught hold of him and killed him and took possession  of his flock. Then this verse was revealed: “He who meets you and extends you  salutations, don’t say: You are not a Muslim” (iv. 94). Ibn ‘Abbas, however, recited the  word as-Salam instead of “as-Salam”.

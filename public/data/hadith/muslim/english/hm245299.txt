24|5299|  Chapter: It Is forbidden to add false hair to one’s head or to pluck the eyebrow or to  separate the teeth.  ‘Aisha reported that a woman from the Ansar married her daughter who had lost her  hair because of illness. She came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said:  Her husband wants that false hair should be added to her head. Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The woman who adds false hair has been  cursed. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Nafi’ with the same chain of  transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.

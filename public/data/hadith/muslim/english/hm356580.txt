35|6580|  Chapter: The reciting of Subbin Allah in the morning and at the time of sleeping.  Abu Huraira reported that Fatima came to Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and  asked for a servant and told him of the hardship of household work. He said: You would  not be able to get a servant from us. May I not direct you to what is better than the  servant for you? Recite Subhaana Allah thirty-three times, al-Hamdu-li-Allah thirty-three  times and Allah-o-Akbar thirty-four times as you go to bed. This hadith has been  narrated on the authority of Suhail with the same chain of transmitters.  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

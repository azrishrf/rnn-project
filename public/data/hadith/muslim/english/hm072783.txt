7|2783|  Chapter: Types of Ihram- It is permissible to enter into the state of Ihram singularly for  the sake of Hajj or for tamattu’ bi’l-‘umra ila’l-Hajj or for both hajj and ‘umra together.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: We went with the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) and we did not see but that he (intended to perform) Hajj (only), but  when we reached Mecca we circumambulated the House; and the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) commanded that he who did not have with him a sacrificial  animal should put off Ihram. She (‘Aisha) said: (And consequently) those who did not  bring the sacrificial anima)s with them put off Ihram; and among his wives (too) who had  not brought the sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram. ‘Aisha said: I entered in the  monthly period and could not (therefore) circumambulate the House. When it was the  night of Hasba she said: Messenger of Allah, people are coming back (after having         performed both) Hajj and Umra, whereas I am coming back only with Hajj, whereupon  he said: Did you not circumambulate (the Ka’ba) that very night we entered Mecca? She  (‘Aisha) said: No, whereupon he said: Go along with your brother to Tan’im and put on  the Ihram for Umra, and it is at such and such a place that you can meet (us). (In the  meanwhile) Safiyya (the wife of the Holy Prophet) said: I think, I will detain you (since I  have entered in the monthly) period and you shall have to wait for me for the farewell  circuit). Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: May you be wounded and your head  shorn did you not circumambulate on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu’I-Hijja)? She  said: Yes. The Holy Prophet (way peace be upon him) said: There is no harm. You  should go forward. ‘Aisha said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was  going upwards to the side of Mecca, whereas I was coming down from it, or I was going  upward, whereas he was coming down. Isbiq said: She was climbing down, and he was  climbing down.

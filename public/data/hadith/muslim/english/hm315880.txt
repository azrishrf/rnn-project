Abu Bakr said: It is I. He (again) said: Who  amongst you has followed the bier today? Abu Bakr said: It is I. He (the Holy Prophet)  again said: Who amongst you has served food to the needy? Abu Bakr said: It is I. He  (again) said: Who amongst you has today visited the sick? Abu Bakr said: It is I.  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He must get into  Paradise who combines in himself (all these noble qualities and virtues).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

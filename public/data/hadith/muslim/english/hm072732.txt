7|2732|  Chapter: It is permissible to shave the head in the state of Ihram if there is a trouble,  and expiation becomes obligatory for shaving.  Ka’b b. ‘Ujra (Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) came to me on the occasion of Hudaibiya and I was kindling fire under my  cooking pot and lice were creeping on my face. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said:  Do the vermin’s harm your head? I said: Yes. He said: Get your head shaved and (in  lieu of it) observe fasts for three days or feed six needy persons, or offer sacrifice (of an  animal). Ayyub said: I do not know with what (type of expiation) did he commence (the  statement).

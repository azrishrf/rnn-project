32|6335|  Chapter: He who goes in the mosque or in the bazaar or a place of gathering like it with  a weapon should see that the spearhead does not harm anyone.         Abu Musa reported Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) assaying: He who  amongst you moves in the mosque or in the bazar and there is an arrow with him he  should take hold of its iron-head in his palm, so that none amongst the Muslims should  receive any injury from it, or he said, should catch its iron-head.

20|4514|  Chapter: Acceptance of gifts on the part of state officers is forbidden.  It has been reported on the authority of ‘Adi b. ‘Amira al-Kindi who said: I heard the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: Whoso from you is appointed by us  to a position of authority and he conceals from us a needle or something smaller than  that, it would be misappropriation (of public funds) and will (have to) produce it on the  Day of Judgment. The narrator says: A dark-complexioned man from the Ansar stood  up-I can visualise him still-and said: Messenger of Allah, take back from me your  assignment. He said: What has happened to you? The man said: I have heard you say  so and so. He said: I say that (even) now: Whoso from you is appointed by as to a  position of authority, he should bring everything, big of small, and whatever he is given  there-from he should take, and he should restrain himself from taking that which is  forbidden.

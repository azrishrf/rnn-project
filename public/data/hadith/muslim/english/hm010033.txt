1|33|  Chapter: Command for fighting against the people so long as they do not profess that  there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. â€˜Umar that the Messenger of Allah  said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god  but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and they establish prayer, and  pay Zakat and if they do it, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on my  behalf except when justified by law, and their affairs rest with Allah.

9|3513|  Chapter: There is no maintenance allowance for one who has been given irrevocable  divorce.  Fatima bint Qais reported that her husband divorced her during the life time of Allah’s  Prophet (may peace be upon him) and gave her a meagre maintenance allowance.  When she saw that, she said: By Allah, I will inform Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him), and if maintenance allowance is due to me then I will accept that which will  suffice me, and if it is not due to me, I will not accept anything from him. She said: I  made a mention of that to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he said:  There is neither maintenance allowance for you nor lodging.

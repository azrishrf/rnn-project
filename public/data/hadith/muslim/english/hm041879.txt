4|1879|  Chapter: Concerning the two sermons before the Friday prayer and sitting for a while  between the two.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported: I was along with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon  him) on Friday when a caravan arrived. The people went to it, and none but twelve  persons were left behind and I was one of them; and it was on this occasion that this  verse was revealed: “And when they see merchandise or sport away to it, and leave  thee standing” (lxii. 11).

30|5848|  Chapter: The merits of Ibrahim. the Friend of Allah (peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying Prophet  Ibrahim (peace be upon him) never told a lie but only thrice: two times for the sake of  Allah (for example, his words): “I am sick,” and his words: “But it was the big one  amongst them which has done that” and because of Sara (his wife). He had come in a  land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with Sara. She was very good-looking  amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that you are my wife they  would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister and in fact  you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I  and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him  (the king): ‘there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so  he (the kings sent someone (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be  upon him) stood in prayer, and when she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could  help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: Supplicate  Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. She did that and the  man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly  than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that  (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up  more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord  so that He may set my hand free; by Allah, I shall do no harm to you. She did and his  hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: You  have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn  them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with  Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you  returned? She said: With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that  debauch and he gave me a maid-servant. Abu Hiaraira said: O sons of the rain of the  sky, she is your mother.             (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

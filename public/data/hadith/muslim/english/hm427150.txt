42|7150|  Chapter: The account of Prophet’s (May peace be upon him) emigration.  Al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib reported that Abu Bakr Siddlq came to the residence of my father  (‘Azib) and bought a haudaj from him and said to ‘Azib: Send your son to my residence         (to carry this haudaj), and my father said to me: Carry it (for him).So I carried it and  there went along with him (with Abu Bakr) my father in order to fetch its price and he  (‘Azib) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr, narrate to me what you both did on the night when  you set out on a journey along with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him).He  said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, and the path  was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a  large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got  down at that place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the  place where the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would take rest under its  shade. I then set the bedding and said: Allah’s Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep  a watch around you. I went out and watched around him. There we saw a shepherd  moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we intended (i.e. taking  rest).I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He said: I am  a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats?  He said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it  should be free from hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara’ striking his hand upon the  other (to give an indication) how he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup  which he had with him and I had with me a bucket in which I kept water for drinking and  for performing ablution. I came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and did not  like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled from the sleep. I poured  water upon the milk (till It was cold) and I said: Allah’s Messenger, take this milk. He  then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to  march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian  and Suraqa b. Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said:  Allah’s Messenger, we are about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not  grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he also said: I know you have  hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I shall turn  everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah’s Messenger)  supplicated Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he  said: I have combed all this side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in  fact fulfilled his promise.  Al-Bara’ reported: Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest  of the hadith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman b. ‘Umar, the words are: He  (Suraqa b. Malik) drew near Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he (the  Holy Prophet) cursed him and his camel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped  from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully aware of It that it is your doing. Supplicate  Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitch-forked) and I give you a  solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are coming after me.  Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at  such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow).He  (the Holy Prophet) said: I don’t need your camels. And we (the Holy Prophet and Abu  Bakr) came to Medina during the night and the people began to contend as to where  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should reside and he encamped in the  tribe of Najjar who were related to ‘Abd ul-Muttalib from the side of mother. Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) honoured them, then people climbed upon house-        top and women also and boys scattered in the way, and they were all crying:  Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, Muhammad,Messenger of Allah.

8|3432|  Chapter: It is permissible to have sexual intercourse with a captive woman after she is purified  (of menses or delivery) in case she has a husband; her marriage is abrogated after she  becomes captive.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (Allah her pleased with him) reported that at the Battle of Hanain  Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) sent an army to Autas and encountered  the enemy and fought with them. Having overcome them and taken them captives, the  Companions of Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) seemed to refrain from  having intercourse with captive women because of their husbands being polytheists.  Then Allah, Most High, sent down regarding that: “And women already married, except  those whom your right hands possess (iv. 24)” (i.e. they were lawful for them when their  ‘Idda period came to an end).

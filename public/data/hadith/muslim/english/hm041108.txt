4|1108|  Chapter: It is allowable to curse Satan during prayer and seek the protection (of the  Lord) and minor acts (of commission) in prayer.  Abu Qatada al-Ansari reported: I saw the Apostle (may peace be upon him) leading the  people in prayer with Umima, daughter of Abu’l-‘As and Zainab, daughter of the Apostle  of Allah (may peace be upon him), on his shoulder. When he bowed, he put her down,  and when he got up after prostration, he lifted her again.

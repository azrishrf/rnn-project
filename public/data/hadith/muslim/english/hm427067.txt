42|7067|  Chapter: Not known.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr b. al-As reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  said: How would you be, O people, when Persia and Rome would be conquered for  you? ‘Abd at-Rahman b Auf said: We would say as Allah has commanded us and we  would express our gratitude to Allah Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) said: Nothing else besides it? You would (in fact) vie with one another, then you  would feel jealous, then your relations would be estranged and then you will bear enmity  against one another or something to the same effect. Then you would go to the poor  emigrants and would make some the masters of the others.

19|4328|  Chapter: Spoils of war.  A hadith has been narrated by Mus’ab b. Sa’d who heard it from his father as saying:  My father took a sword from Khums and brought it to the Holy Prophet (may peace be  upon him) and said: Grant it to me. He refused. At this Allah revealed (the Qur’anic  verse): “They ask thee concerning the spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war are for Allah  and the Apostle” (viii. 1).

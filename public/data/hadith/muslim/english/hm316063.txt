31|6063|  Chapter: The merits of Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him).  Anas reported: My mother Umm Anas came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him). And she prepared my lower garment out of the half of her headdress and (with the  other half) she covered my upper body and said: Allah’s Messenger, here is my son  Unais; I have brought him to you for serving you. Invoke blessings of Allah upon him.  Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: O Allah, make an increase in his wealth, and  progeny. Anas said: By Allah, my fortune is huge and my children, and grand-children  are now more than one hundred.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

19|4420|  Chapter: Wrath of Allah upon a person who is killed by the Prophet himself (may peace be  upon him).  It has been narrated by Hammam b. Munabbih who said: This is what has been related  to us by Abu Huraira from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). (With this  introduction) he narrated a number of traditions. One of these was that the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Great is the wrath of Allah upon a people who  have done this to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and he was at that  time pointing to his front teeth. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) also  said: Great is the wrath of Allah upon a person who has been killed by the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) in the way of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious.

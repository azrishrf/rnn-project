4|1219|  Chapter: Dhikr after the prayer.         Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When  any one of you completes the last tashahhud, he should seek refuge with Allah from  four (trials) i.e. from the torment of Hell, from the torment of grave, from the trial of life  and death.-and from the mischief of Masih at-Dajjal (Antichrist). This Hadith has been  narrated by al-Auza’i with the same chain of transmitters but with these words: “When  any one of you completes the tashahhud” and he made no mention of the words “the  last”.

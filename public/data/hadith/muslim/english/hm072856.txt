7|2856|  Chapter: Concerning Tamattul in Hajj.  Muslim al-Qurri heard Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) saying that Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) entered into the state of Ihram for Umra and his  Companions for Hajj. Neither Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) nor those  among his Companions who had brought sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram,  whereas the rest (of the pilgrims) did so. Talha b. Ubaidullah was one of those who had  brought the sacrificial animals along with them so he did not put off Ihram.

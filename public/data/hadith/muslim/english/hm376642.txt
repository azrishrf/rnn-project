37|6642|  Chapter: Repentance is accepted so long as one repents after committing sins.  Abu Huraira reported from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that his Lord,  the Exalted and Glorious, thus said. A servant committed a sin and he said: O Allah,  forgive me my sins, and Allah (the Exalted and Glorious)said:My servant committed a  sin and then he came to realise that he has a Lord Who forgives the sins and takes to  account (the sinner) for the sin. He then again committed a sin and said: My Lord,  forgive me my sin, and Allah, the Exalted and High, said: My servant committed a sin  and then came to realise that he has a Lord Who would forgive his sin or would take  (him) to account for the sin. He again committed a sin and said: My Lord, forgive me for  my sin, and Allah (the Exalted and High) said: My servant has committed a sin and then  came to realise that he has a Lord Who forgives the sins or takes (him) to account for  sin. O servant, do what you like. I have granted you forgiveness.  ‘Abd al-A’la said: I do not know whether he said thrice or four times to do “what you  desire”. The hadith has been narrated on the authority of ‘Abd al-A’la b. Hammad with  the same chain of transmitters.

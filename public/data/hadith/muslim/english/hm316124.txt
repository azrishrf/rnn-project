31|6124|  Chapter: The merits of the tribes of Ghifir, Ashia’, Muzaina, Tamim, Daws and Tayyi.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: By Him in  Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, (the tribes of) Ghifar, Aslam, Muzaina, or from  the tribe of Juhaina or from the tribe of Muzaina, they would be better in the eye of Allah  than Asad, Tayyi, and Ghatfan on the Day of Resurrection.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

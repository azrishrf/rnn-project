20|4493|  Chapter: The merits of a just ruler and the demerits of a tyrant ruler.  It has been narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: Behold! the Dispensers of justice will be seated on the  pulpits of light beside God, on the right side of the Merciful, Exalted and Glorious. Either  side of the being is the right side both being equally meritorious. (The Dispensers of  justice are) those who do justice in their rules, in matters relating to their families and in  all that they undertake to do.

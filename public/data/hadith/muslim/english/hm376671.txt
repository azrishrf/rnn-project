37|6671|  Chapter: Pertaining to the repentance of Ka’b b. Malik and his companions.  ‘Abdullah b. K’ab, who was his (Ka’b’s) guide as he became blind, reported that he  heard from Ka’b b. Malik the story of his staying behind Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) from the expedition of Tabuk. The rest of the hadith is the same (but with  this variation) that in the narration transmitted on the authority of Yunus (the words are):  When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) intended to set on an expedition he  kept It as a secret, but, he did not do so in thick expedition. And in the narration  transmitted on the authority of Muhammad b. Abdullah b. Muslim, there is no mention of  Abu Khaithana (Allah be pleased with him) and no mention of his meeting with Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him).

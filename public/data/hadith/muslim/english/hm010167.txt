1|167|  Chapter: He who dies associating none with Allah would enter Paradise and he who  dies as a polytheist would enter the fire of Hell.  It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas’ud that Waki told (him) that the  Messenger of Allah had observed and Ibn Numair asserted: I heard the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) saying: He who dies associating anything with Allah  would enter the Fire (of Hell). ‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud said: I say that he who died without  associating anything with Allah entered Paradise.

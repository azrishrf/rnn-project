Mas’ud said in connection with the verse: “Those whom they call upon,  themselves seek the means of access to their Lord,” that that verse was revealed in         connection with a party of Arabs who used to worship a group amongst the jinn; the jinn  embraced Islam but the people kept worshipping them without being conscious of it.  Then this verse was revealed: “Those whom they call upon, themselves seek the  means of access to their Lord.”

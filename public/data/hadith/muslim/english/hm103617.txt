10|3617|  Chapter: It is forbidden that one should enter into a transaction on which one’s brother  has already been negotiating, or one should purchase (in opposition) to one’s brother,  or one should cheat and retain milk in the under (in order to deceive the purchaser).  Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as having said this: One amongst you should not enter into a transaction  when another is bargaining.

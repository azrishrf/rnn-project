4|1187|  Chapter: It is forbidden to cry out for finding out the lost thing in the mosque.  ‘Imran b. Husain reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said the  afternoon prayer and gave the salutation at the end of three rak’ahs and then went into  his house. A man called al-Khirbaq, who bad long aims, got up and went to him, and  addressed him as Messenger of Allah and mentioned to him what he had done. He  came out angrily trailing his mantle, and when he came to the people he said: Is this  man telling the truth? They said: Yes. He then said one rak’ah and then gave salutation  and then performed two prostrations and then gave salutation.

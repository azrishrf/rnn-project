7|2932|  Chapter: The pilgrim should continue to pronounce Talbiya until the stoning of Jamrat  al-‘Aqaba on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu’l-Hajja).  Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) made al-Fadl sit behind him (on the camel back) from the place (where the  two prayers) are combined (Muzdalifa). Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) also  informed that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) did not stop pronouncing  Talbiya till he threw pebbles at Jamrat al-‘Aqaba.

6|2456|  Chapter: There is no harm in observing fast if one is Junbi even after dawn.  Sulaiman b. Yasar reported that he asked Umm Salama whether a person (who gets  up) in the morning in a state of junub should observe fast. She said: The Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) (at times) got up in the morning in a state of junub, not  because of sexual dreams (but on account of intercourse at night), and then observed  fast.

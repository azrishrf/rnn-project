31|6149|  Chapter: The merits of the companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and of  those who are next to them and then of those who are next to them.  Abu Sa’id Khudri reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  There would come to the people a time when a detachment would be sent for fighting in  the cause of Allah and they would say: See, if you can find amongst them someone  from amongst the Companions of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him). They would  find a person and they would be granted victory because of him. Then a second  detachment would be sent to them and they would say: Do you find amongst them one  who had had the privilege of seeing the Companions of the Apostle of Allah (may peace  be upon him)?-and the victory would be granted to them because of him. Then the third  detachment would be sent and it would be said to them: See, if you find amongst them  (who had had the honour of seeing one) who saw those who saw the Companions of  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him). Then the fourth detachment would be sent  and it would be said to them: See it you find amongst them one who had the privilege  (of seeing) one who saw those who saw those who saw the Companions of Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him), and a person would be found and they would be  granted victory because of him.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

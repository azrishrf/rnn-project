10|3620|  Chapter: It is forbidden that one should enter into a transaction on which one’s brother  has already been negotiating, or one should purchase (in opposition) to one’s brother,  or one should cheat and retain milk in the under (in order to deceive the purchaser).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do not go  out to meet riders to enter into transaction with them; none of you must buy in  opposition to another, nor must you bid against one another; a townsman must not sell  for a man from the desert, and do not tie up udders of camels and sheep, and he who  buys them after that has been done has two courses open to him: after he has milked  them he may keep them if he is pleased with them, or he may return them along with a  sit of dates if he is displeased with them.

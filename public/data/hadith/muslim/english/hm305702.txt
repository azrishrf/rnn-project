30|5702|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  Thauban reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: I would be  pushing back from my Cistern the crowd of people. I would strike away from it (the  Cistern) with my staff the people of Yemen until the water (of the Haud) would spout  forth upon them. He was asked about its breadth. He said: From this place of mine to  ‘Amman, and he was asked about the drink and he said: It is whiter than milk and  sweeter than honey. There would spout into it two streamlets having their sources in  Paradise; the one is from gold and the other is from silver. This hadith has been  narrated on the authority of Hisham with the same chain of transmitters and the words  are: “I would be on the Day of Resurrection near the bank of the Cistern.”  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

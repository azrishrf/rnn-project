7|2991|  Chapter: It is a sunnah that on the day of Nahar one should throw pebbles, then  slaughter animal, then get one’s head shaved, and one should start shaving one’s head  from the right side.  Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased wish him) reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) came to Mina; he went to the Jamra and threw pebbles at it, after which  he went to his lodging in Mina, and sacrificed the animal. He then called for a barber  and, turning his right side to him, let him shave him; after which he timed his left side.  He then gave (these hair) to the people.

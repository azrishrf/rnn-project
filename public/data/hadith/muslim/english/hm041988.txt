4|1988|  Chapter: Mention of the torment of grave in eclipse prayer.  Abu Masâ€™ud reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Verily  the sun and the moon do not eclipse on account of the death of any one of the people,  but they are the two signs among the signs of Allah. So when you see it, stand up and  observe prayer.

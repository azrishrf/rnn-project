4|1247|  Chapter: Excellence of Dhikr after prayer and its description.  Anas reported: A man came panting and entered the row of worshippers and said:  Praise be to Allah, much praised and blessed. When the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) finished the prayer he said: Who amongst you uttered these  words? The people remained silent. He (the Holy Prophet again said)-: Who amongst  you uttered these words? He said nothing wrong. Then a man said: I came and had a  difficulty in breathing, so I uttered them. He replied: I saw twelve angels facing one  another as to who will take them up (to Allah).

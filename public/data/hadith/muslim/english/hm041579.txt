4|1579|  Chapter: Excellence observing two Rak’ahs of Sunnah in the dawn prayer.  Umm Habiba (the wife of the Holy Prophet) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: A house will be built in Paradise, for anyone who prays in a day  and a night twelve rak’ahs; and she added: I have never abandoned (observing them)  since I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Some of the  other narrators said the same words: I have never abandoned (observing them) since I  heard (from so and so).

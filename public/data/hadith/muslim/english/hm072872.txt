7|2872|  Chapter: Talbiya of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and his sacrifice.         Abu Sa’id (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We went out with Allah’s messenger  (may peace be upon him) pronouncing loudly the Talbiya for Hajj When we came to  Mecca, he commanded us that we should change this (Ihram for Hajj) to that of Umra  except one who had brought the sacrificial animal with him. When it was the day of  Tarwiya (8th of Dhu’l-Hijja) and we went to Mini, we (again) pronounced Talbiya for Hajj.

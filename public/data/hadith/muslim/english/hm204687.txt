20|4687|  Chapter: One who fights that the word of Allah is exalted fights in the way of Allah.         It has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters on the same authority, i.e.  Abu Musa Ashâ€™ari, that a man asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  about fighting in the way of Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, a man who fights out of  rage or out of family pride. He raised his head towards him-and he did so because the  man was standing and said: Who fights that the word of Allah be exalted fights in the  way of Allah.

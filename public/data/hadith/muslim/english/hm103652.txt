10|3652|  Chapter: It is invalid to sell the commodity before taking possession of it.  Abu Huraira (Allah be please with him) is reported to have said to Marwan: Have you  made lawful the transactions involving interest? Thereupon Marwan said: I have not  done that. Thereupon Abu Huraira (may peace be upon him) said: You have made  lawful the transactions with the help of documents only, whereas Allahâ€™s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) forbade the transaction of food-grains until full possession is  taken of them. Marwan then addressed the people and forbade them to enter into such  transactions (as are done with the help of documents). Sulaiman said: I saw the  sentinels snatching (these documents) from the people.

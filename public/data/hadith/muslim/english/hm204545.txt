20|4545|  Chapter: Fulfilment of the covenant made with the Caliphs is imperative, the caliph to  whom allegiance is sworn in the first instance has an established supremacy over those  who assume powers.  It has been narrated on the authority of â€˜Abdullah who said: The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: After me there will be favouritism and many things that  you will not like. They (his Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, what do you order  that one should do it anyone from us has to live through such a time? He said: You         should discharge your own responsibility (by obeying your Amir), and ask God to  concede your right (by guiding the Amir to the right path or by replacing him by one  more just and God-fearing).

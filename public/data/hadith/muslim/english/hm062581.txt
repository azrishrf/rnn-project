6|2581|  Chapter: The fasts observed by the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) besides  Ramadhan.  Abu Salama reported: I asked ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) about the fasting of the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: He used to observe fast (at  times so continuously) that we said: He has fasted (never to break), and he did not  observe fast till we said: He has given up perhaps never to fast, and I never saw him  observing (voluntary fasts) more in any other month than that of Sha’ban.(It appeared  as if) he observed fast throughout the whole of Sha’ban except a few (days).

7|3071|  Chapter: The merit of entering the ka’ba for a pilgrim and observing of prayer in it.  Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported: Allah’s Messenger,(may peace be  upon him) entered the House, and Usama, Bilal and Uthman b. Talha were with him,  and they kept the door closed for a considerable time. Then it was opened and I was  the first to enter the House and meet Bilal, and I said: Where did Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) observe prayer? He said: Between these two front pillars. I,  however, forgot to ask him the number of rak’ahs that he observed.

32|6285|  Chapter: He upon whom Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) invoked curse  whereas he in fact did not deserve it, it would be a source of reward and mercy for him.  ‘Aisha reported that two persons visited Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  and both of them talked about a thing, of which I am not aware, but that annoyed him  and he invoked curse upon both of them and hurled malediction, and when they went  out I said: Allah’s Messenger, the good would reach everyone but it would not reach  these two. He said: Why so? I said: Because you have invoked curse and hurled  malediction upon both of them. He said: Don’t you know that I have made condition with  my Lord saying thus: O Allah, I am a human being and that for a Muslim upon whom I  invoke curse or hurl malediction make it a source of purity and reward.

7|2747|  Chapter: What is to be done with a Muhrim when he dies.  Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported: While a person was standing in ‘Arafat  with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) he fell down from his camel and  broke his neck. This was mentioned to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him),  whereupon he said: Bathe him with water mixed with the leaves of the lote tree and  shroud him in two (pieces of) cloth and neither perfume him nor cover his head; (Ayyub  said) for Allah would raise him on the Day of Resurrection in the state of pronouncing  Talbiya. (‘Amr. however, said): Verily Allah would raise him on the Day of Resurrection  pronouncing Talbiya. Sa’id b. Jubair narrated this Hadith on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas  (Allah be pleased with them) that a person was standing with the Apostle of Allah (may  peace be upon him) as he was in the state of Ihram. The rest of the Hadith is the same.

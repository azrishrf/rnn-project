15|4050|  Chapter: It is excellent to break the vow if one finds it better doing that which is against this vow  one should expiate it.  Abu Musa al-Ash’ari reported: We came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  requesting him to provide us with riding camels. He (the Holy Prophet) said: There is  nothing with me with which I should equip you. By Allah, I would not provide you with  (riding camels). Then Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent to us three  camels with spotted bumps. We said: We came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) asking him to equip us with riding animals. He took an oath that he could not  equip us. We came to him and informed him. He said: By Allah, I do not take an oath,  but when I find the other thing better than that, I do that which is better.

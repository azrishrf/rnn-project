4|792|  Chapter: Argument of those who assert that Bismillah is a part of every Sura except Sura  Tauba.  Wa’il b. Hujr reported: He saw the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) raising his  hands at the time of beginning the prayer and reciting takbir, and according to Hammam  (the narrator), the hands were lifted opposite to ears. He (the Holy Prophet) then  wrapped his hands in his cloth and placed his right hand over his left hand. And when  he was about to bow down, he brought out his hands from the cloth, and then lifted  them, and then recited takbir and bowed down, and when (he came back to the erect  position) he recited: “Allah listened to him who praised Him.” And when prostrates, he  prostrated between the two palms.

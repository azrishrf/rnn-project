5|2179|  Chapter: Excellence of spending on one’s family, and servant, and sin of one who neglects or  withholds their subsistence.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that Allah  said to him: “Spend, I will bestow upon you.” And the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) said: The right hand of Allah is full and spending (the riches) liberally  during day and night will not diminish (the resources of Allah). Don’t you see what (an  enormous amount of resources) He has spent since He created the heaven and the  earth, and what is in His right hand has not decreased? His Throne is upon the water.  And in His other hand is death, and He elevates and degrades (whom He likes).

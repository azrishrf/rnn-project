25|5316|  Chapter: Forbiddance in calling one (other than Allah’s Apostle) with the Kunya of Abdu’l- Qasim and the fact pertaining to good names.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported that a child was born to a person amongst us and he gave  him the name of Muhammad. Thereupon his people said: We will not allow You to give  the name of Muhammad (to your child) after the name of Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him). He set forth with his son carrying him on his back and came to Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him’, and said: Allah’s Messenger a son has been born to  me and I have given him the name after the name of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him), whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Give him my  name but do not give him my kunya, for I am Qasim in the sense that I distribute (the  spoils of war) and the dues of Zakat amongst you.

1|254|  Chapter: Warning for one appropriating the right of a Muslim by taking a false oath: the  fire (of Hell) is his chastisement.  It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah (b. Umar) that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) observed: He who perjured with a view to appropriating the  property of a Muslim, and he is in fact a liar and would meet Allah in a state that He  would be angry with him. He (the narrator) said: There came Ash’ath b. Qais and said         (to the people): What does Abu Abdur-Rahman (the Kunya of Abdullah b. Umar) narrate  to you? They replied: So and so. Upon this he remarked: Abu Abdur-Rahman told the  truth. This (command) has been revealed in my case. There was a piece of land in  Yemen over which I and another person had a claim. I brought the dispute with him to  the Apostle of Allah (to decide) He (the Holy Prophet) said: Can you produce an  evidence (in your support)? I said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: (Then the  decision would be made) on his oath. I said: He would readily take an oath. Upon this  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: He who perjured for  appropriating the wealth of a Muslim, whereas he is a liar, would meet Allah while He  would be angry with him. This verse was then revealed: “Verily those who barter Allah’s  covenant and their oaths at a small price...” (iii 77).

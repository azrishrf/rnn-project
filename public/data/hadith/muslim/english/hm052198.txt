5|2198|  Chapter: Concerning one who spends and who withholds.  Abu Dharr reported: some of the people from among the Companions of the Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him) said to him: Messenger of Allah, the rich have taken  away (air the) reward. They observe prayer as we do; they keep the fasts as we keep,  and tray give Sadaqa out of their surplus riches. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said:  Has Allah not prescribed for you (a course) by following which you can (also) do  sadaqa? In every declaration of the glorification of Allah (i.e. saying Subhan Allah) there  is a Sadaqa, and every Takbir (i.e. saying Allah-O-Akbar) is a sadaqa, and every praise  of His (saying al-Hamdu Lillah) is a Sadaqa and every declaration that He is One (La  illha ill-Allah) is a sadaqa, and enjoining of good is a sadaqa, and forbidding of that  which is evil is a Sadaqa, and in man’s sexual Intercourse (with his wife,) there is a  Sadaqa. They (the Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, is there reward for him who  satisfies his sexual passion among us? He said: Tell me, if he were to devote it to  something forbidden, would it not be a sin on his part? Similarly, if he were to devote it  to something lawful, he should have a reward.

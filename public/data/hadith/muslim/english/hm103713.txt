10|3713|  Chapter: Forbiddance of al-Mubiqala, and al-Muzabana, and al-Mukhabara and the  sale of fruits before their good condition is clear, and al-Mu’awama, i.e., the sale for  some years.  A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Jabir (Allah be pleased with him)  from Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), but he made no mention of transactions  years (ahead) implying Mu’awama.

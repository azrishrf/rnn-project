23|4910|  Chapter: It is not approved to prepare Nabidh by mixing dry dates and grapes.  Ibn ‘Abbas reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) forbade the mixing of  dates and grapes together, and mixing of unripe dates and ripe dates together (for  preparing Nabidh), and he wrote to the people of Jurash (in Yemen) forbidding them to  prepare the mixture of dates and grapes. This hadith has been narrated through another  chain of transmitters with a slight variation of words.

4|897|  Chapter: Women coming out (from their houses) for going to the mosque when there is no  apprehension of wickedness, but they should not come out scented.  Ibn ‘Abbas reported: The word of (Allah) Great and Glorious: ‘And utter not thy prayer  loudly, nor be low in it” (xvii. 110) was revealed as the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) was hiding himself in Mecca. When he led his Companions in prayer he  raised his voice (while reciting the) Qur’an. And when the polytheists heard that, they  reviled the Qur’an and Him Who revealed it and him who brought it. Upon this Allah, the  Exalted, said to His Apostle (may peace be upon him): Utter not thy prayer so loudly  that the polytheists may hear thy recitation and (recite it) not so low that it may be  inaudible to your Companions. Make them hear the Qur’an, but do not recite it loudly  and seek a (middle) way between these. Recite between loud and low tone.

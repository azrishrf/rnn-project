41|6908|  Chapter: The events foretold by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) about the last hour.  Hudhaifa b. al-Yaman reported: By Allah, I have the best knowledge amongst people  about every turmoil which is going to appear in the period intervening me and the Last  Hour; and it is not for the fact that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) told me  something confidentially pertaining to it and he did not tell anybody else about it, but it is  because of the fact that I was present in the assembly in which he had been describing  the turmoil. and he especially made a mention of three turmoil’s which would not spare  anything and amongst these there would be turmoil’s like storms in the hot season.  Some of them would be violent and some of them would be comparatively mild.  Hudhaifa said: All (who were present) except I have gone (to the next world).

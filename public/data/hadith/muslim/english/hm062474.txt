6|2474|  Chapter: Permissibility of observing the fast or not observing it in the month of Ramadan for a  traveller.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported that in the course of a  journey Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw a man, people crowding  around him and providing him a shade. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: What is  the matter with him? They said: He is a person observing fast. Whereupon the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: It is no righteousness that you fast  on journey.

8|3332|  Chapter: Pertaining to the marriage of Zainab bint Jahsh with the Holy Prophet (May peace be  upon him) and verses pertaining to purdah veil).  Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Allah’s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) gave no better wedding feast than the one he did (on the occasion of his  marriage with) Zainab. Thabit al-Bunani (one of the narrators) said: What did he serve in  the wedding feast? He (Anas) said: He fed them bread and meat (so lavishly) that they  (the guests) abandoned it (of their own accord after having taken them to their hearts’  content).

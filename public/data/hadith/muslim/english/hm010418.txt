1|418|  Chapter: The admittance into Paradise of a group of Muslims without rendering any  account and suffering punishment (torment).  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: Seventy thousand (persons) of my Ummah would enter Paradise  without rendering an account. Upon this a person said: Messenger of Allah; pray to  Allah that He make me one of them. He (the Holy Prophet) said: O Allah! make him one  of them. Then another stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah that He  make me one of them. He (the Holy Prophet) said: â€˜Ukkasha has preceded you in this  matter.

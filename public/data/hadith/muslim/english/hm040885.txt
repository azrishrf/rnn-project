4|885|  Chapter: The praying women have been commanded not to precede men in lifting their heads  from prostration.  Abdullah b. Umar reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say:  Don’t prevent your women from going to the mosque when they seek your permission.  Bilal b. ‘Abdullah said: By Allah, we shall certainly prevent them. On this ‘Abdullah b.  Umar turned towards him and reprimanded him to harshly as I had never heard him do  before. He (‘Abdullah b. Umar) said: I am narrating to you that which comes from the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and you (have the audacity) to say: By  Allah, we shall certainly prevent them.

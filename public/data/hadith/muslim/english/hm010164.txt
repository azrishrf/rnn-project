1|164|  Chapter: Forbiddance of pride.  It Is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Masâ€™ud that the Apostle of Allah (may  peace be upon him), observed: He who has in his heart the weight of a mustard seed of  pride shall not enter Paradise. A person (amongst his hearers) said: Verily a person  loves that his dress should be fine, and his shoes should be fine. He (the Holy Prophet)  remarked: Verily, Allah is Graceful and He loves Grace. Pride is disdaining the truth (out  of self-conceit) and contempt for the people.

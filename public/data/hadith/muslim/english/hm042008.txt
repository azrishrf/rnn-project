4|2008|  Chapter: Weeping for the dead.  Usama b. Zaid reported: While we were with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon  him), one of his daughters sent to him (the Messenger) to call him and inform him that  her child or her son was dying. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) told  the messenger to go back and tell her that what Allah had taken belonged to Him, and  to him belonged what He granted; and He has an appointed time for everything. So you  (the messenger) order her to show endurance and seek reward from Allah. The  messenger came back and said: She adjures him to come to her. He got up to go  accompanied by Sa’d b. ‘Ubada, Mu’adh b. Jabal, and I also went along with them. The  child was lifted to him and his soul was feeling as restless as if it was in an old (water- skin). His (Prophet’s) eyes welled up with tears. Sa’d said: What is this, Messenger of  Allah? He replied: This is compassion which Allah has placed in the hearts of His  servants, and God shows compassion only to those of His servants who are  compassionate.

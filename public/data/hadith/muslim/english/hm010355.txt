1|355|  Chapter: Affirmation of intercession and rescue from Fire of the believers in Oneness of  Allah.  Abu Saâ€™id al-Khudri reported: Verily the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  said: Allah will admit into Paradise those deserving of Paradise, and He will admit whom  He wishes out of His Mercy, and admit those condemned to Hell into the Fire (of Hell).  He would then say: See, he whom you find having as much faith in his heart as a grain  of mustard, bring him out. They will then be brought out burned and turned to charcoal,  and would be cast into the river of life, and they would sprout as does a seed in the silt  carried away by flood. Have you not seen that it comes out yellow (fresh) and  intertwined?

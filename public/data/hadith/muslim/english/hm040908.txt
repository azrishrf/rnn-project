4|908|  Chapter: Recitation of the Qur’an loudly in the dawn prayer.  Abu Qatada reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led us in  prayer and recited in the first two rak’ahs of the noon and afternoon prayers Surat al- Fitiha and two (other) surahs. And he would sometimes recite loud enough for us the  verses. He would prolong the first rak’ah more than the second. And he acted similarly  in the morning prayer.

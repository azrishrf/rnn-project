30|5670|  Chapter: The extreme love of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for his Umma, and  his extreme anxiety to warn them against that which is a source of trouble to them.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The similitude of  mine and that of my Umma is that of a person who lit fire and there began to fall into it insects  and moths. And I am there to hold you back, but you plunge into it.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

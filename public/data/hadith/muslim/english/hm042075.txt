4|2075|  Chapter: What is said in case of one who gets relief and the one from whom the other  gets relief.  Qatada b. Rib’i reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  Whenever a bier passed before him, he said: He is the one to find relief and the one  with (the departure of him) other will find relief. They said: Apostle of Allah, who is al- Mustarih and al-Mustarah? Upon this he said: The believing servant finds relief from the  troubles of the world, and in the death of a wicked person, the people, towns, trees and  animals find relief.

20|4715|  Chapter: Saying of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him): “A group of people from  my Umma will always remain on the right path and continue to be triumphant.’ their  opponents shall not be able to do them any harm.  It has been narrated on the authority of Thauban that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: A group of people from my Umma will always remain  triumphant on the right path and continue to be triumphant (against their opponents). He  who deserts them shall not be able to do them any harm. They will remain in this  position until Allah’s Command is executed (i.e. Qayamah is established). In Qutaiba’s  version of the tradition, we do not have the words: “They will remain in this position.”

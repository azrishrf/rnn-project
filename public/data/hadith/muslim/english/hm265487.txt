Mihsan said: I visited Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with my son who had not, by that time,  been weaned and he pissed over his (clothes). He ordered water to be brought and  sprinkled (it) over them. She (further) said: I visited him (Allah’s Apostle) along with my  son and I had squeezed the swelling in the uvula, whereupon he said: Why do you  afflict your children by compressing like this? Use this Indian aloeswood, for it contains  seven types of remedies, one among them being a remedy for pleurisy. It is applied  through the nose for a swelling of the uvula and poured into the side of the mouth for  pleurisy.

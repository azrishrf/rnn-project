7|2751|  Chapter: What is to be done with a Muhrim when he dies.  Ibn â€˜Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that when a person who was in the  state of Ihram was in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him),  his camel broke his neck and he died. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: Bathe him with water (mixed with the leaves) of the lute tree and shroud  him in his two (pieces of) cloth and, neither perfume him nor cover his head, for he  would be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing Talbiya.

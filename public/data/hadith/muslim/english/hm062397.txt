6|2397|  Chapter: The timing of fast begins with the dawn.  Sahl b. Sa’d said that when this verse was revealed: “Eat and drink till the white streak  is distinct from the dark streak,” a person would take hold of a white thread and a black  thread and keep on eating till he could find them distinct (in the light of the dawn). It was         then that Allah, the Majestic and Great, revealed (the words) min al-fajr (from the dawn),  and then it became clear (that the word khait refers to the streak of light in the dawn).

5|2331|  Chapter: It is forbidden to pay Zakat to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and  Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib.  ‘Abida narrated from ‘Ali that he made a mention of the Khwarij (and in this connection)  said that there would be a person among them with a defective hand, (or with a short  hand) or a fleshy hand. If you were to exercise restraint, I would tell you what Allah has  promised to those who would kill them on the order of Muhammad (may peace be upon  him). I (the narrator) said to him: Did you hear it from Muhammad: (may peace be upon  him)? He (Hadrat ‘Ali) said: Yes, by the Lord of the Ka’ba; Yes, by the Lord of the Ka’ba;  yes, by the Lord of the Ka’ba.

35|6570|  Chapter: Refuge from the evil of what one has done, and what one has not done.  Abdullah reported that when it was evening Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) used to supplicate: “We have entered upon evening and so, too, the whole  Kingdom of Allah has entered upon evening. Praise is due to Allah. There is no god but  Allah, the One having no partner with Him.” He (the narrator) said: I think that he also  uttered (in this supplication these words): “His is the Sovereignty and to Him is praise  due and He is Potent over everything. My Lord, I beg of Thee good that lies in this night  and good that follows it and I seek refuge in Thee from the evil that lies in this night and  from the evil of that which follows it. My Lord, I seek refuge in Thee from sloth, from the  evil of vanity. My Lord, I seek refuge in Thee from torment of the Hell-Fire and from  torment of the grave.” And when it was morning he said like this: “We entered upon  morning and the whole Kingdom of Allah enter ed upon morning.”  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

19|4412|  Chapter: The battle of Ahzab or the battle of the Ditch.  It has been narrated by Ibrahim al-Taimi on the authority of his father who said: We  were sitting in the company of Hudhaifa. A man said: If I were in the time of the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), I would have fought by his side and  would have striven hard for his causes. Hudhaifa said: You might have done that, (but  you should not make a flourish of your enthusiasm). I was with the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) on the night of the Battle of Abzib and we were gripped by a  violent wind and severe cold. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be him) said: Hark,  the man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked  with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We all kept quiet  and none of us responded to him. (Again) he said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring  and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment  by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We kept quiet and none of us responded to him. He  again said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy  shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgement by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted)  Then he said: Get up Hudhaifa, bring me the news of the enemy. When he called me by  name I had no alternative but to get up. He said: Go and bring me information about the  enemy, and do nothing that may provoke them against me. When I left him, I felt warm  as if I were walking in a heated bath until I reached them. I saw Abu Sufyan warming his  back against fire I put an arrow in the middle of the bow, intending to shoot at him, when  I recalled the words of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) “Do not  provoke them against me.” Had I shot at him, I would have hit him. But I returned and  (felt warm as if) I were walking in a heated bath (hammam). Presenting myself before  him, I gave him information about the enemy. When I had done so, I began to feel cold,  so the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) wrapped me in a blanket that he  had in excess to his own requirement and with which he used to cover himself while  saying his prayers. So I continued to sleep until it was morning. When it was morning he  said: Get up, O heavy sleeper.

4|845|  Chapter: The Imam is authorised to appoint one as his deputy when there is a valid reason for  it (for example, illness or journey or any other), and if an Imam leads the prayer sitting as he  cannot do so standing, his followers should say prayer standing provided they are able to do it  and there is an abrogation of saying prayer sitting behind a sitting Imam.  Sahl b. Sa’d al-Sa’idi reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) went  to the tribe of Bani Amr b. Auf in order to bring reconciliation amongst (its members),  and It was a time of prayer. The Mu’adhdhin came to Abu Bakr and said: Would you  lead the prayer in case I recite takbir (tahrima, with which the prayer begins)?He (Abu  Bakr) said: Yes. He (the narrator) said: He (Abu Bakr) started (leading) the prayer. The  people were engaged in observing prayer when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) happened to come there and made his way (through the people) till he stood  in a row. The people began to clap (their hands), but Abu Bakr paid no heed (to it) in  prayer. When the people clapped more vigorously, he (Abu Bakr) then paid heed and  saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) there. (He was about to withdraw  when) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) signed to him to keep standing  at his place. Abu Bakr lifted his hands and praised Allah for what the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) had commanded him and then Abu Bakr withdrew  himself till he stood in the midst of the row and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) stepped forward and led the prayer. When (the prayer) was over, he (the  Holy Prophet) said: O Abu Bakr, what prevented you from standing (at that place) as I  ordered you to do? Abu Bakr said: It does not become the son of Abu Quhafa to lead  prayer before the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Messenger of         Allah (may peace be upon him) said (to the people) around him: What is it that I saw  you clapping so vigorously? (Behold) when anything happens in prayer, say:  Subhanallah, for when you would utter it, it would attract the attention, while clapping of  hands is meant for women.

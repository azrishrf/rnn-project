Arqamwent to him (Ibn ‘Abbas) and said: Narrate how you informed me about  the meat of the game presented to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as  he was in the state of Ihram. Thereupon he said: He was presented with a slice of the  meat of game, but he returned it to him (who presented it) saying: We are not going to  eat it, as we are in the state of Ihram.

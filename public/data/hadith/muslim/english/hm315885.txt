31|5885|  Chapter: The excellent qualities of ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Ibn Abu Mulaika reported: I heard Ibn ‘Abbas as saying: When ‘Umar b. Khatab was  placed in the coffin the people gathered around him. They praised him and supplicated         for him before the bier was lifted up, and I was one amongst them. Nothing attracted my  attention but a person who gripped my shoulder from behind. I saw towards him and  found that he was ‘All. He invoked Allah’s mercy upon ‘Umar and said: You have left  none behind you (whose) deeds (are so enviable) that I love to meet Allah with them. By  Allah, I hoped that Allah would keep you and your two associates together. I had often  heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I came and there came  too Abu Bakr and ‘Umar; I entered and there entered too Abu Bakr and ‘Umar; I went  out and there went out too Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and I hope and think that Allah will  keep you along with them.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

1|302|  Chapter: The beginning of Revelation to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him).  This hadith has been narrated on the authority of â€˜Aisha with another chain of narrators  like one transmitted by Yunus, i.e. the first thing with which the revelation was initiated  with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) except the words: By Allah, Allah  would never humiliate you, and Khadija said: O son of my uncle! Listen to the son of  your brother.

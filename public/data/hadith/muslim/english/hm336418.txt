33|6418|  Chapter: Allah turns the hearts as He desires.  Abdullah b. Amr b. al-‘As reported that he heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Verily, the hearts of all the sons of Adam are between the two  fingers out of the fingers of the Compassionate Lord as one heart. He turns that to any  (direction) He likes. Then Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah,  the Turner of the hearts, turn our hearts to Thine obedience.

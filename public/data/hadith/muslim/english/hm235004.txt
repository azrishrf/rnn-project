23|5004|  Chapter: Etiquette relating to eating and drinking.  Hudhaifa reported: When we attended a dinner along with the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) we did not lay our hands on the food until Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) had laid his hand and commenced eating (the food). Once we went  with him to a dinner when a girl came rushingly as it someone had been pursuing her.  She was about to lay her hand on the food, when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) caught her hand. Then a desert Arab came there (rushingly) as if someone  had been pursuing him. He (the Holy Prophet) caught his hand; and then Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Satan considers that food lawful on which  Allah’s name is not mentioned. He had brought this girl so that the food might be made  lawful for him and I caught her hand. And he had brought a desert Arab so that (the  food) might be lawful for him. So I caught his hand. By Him, in Whose hand is my life, it  was (Satan’s) hand that was in my hand along with her hand.

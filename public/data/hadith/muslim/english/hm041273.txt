4|1273|  Chapter: He who came up with the Rak’ah, he in fact came up with the prayer (led in  congregation with the Imam).  Abdullah b. ‘Amr reported the Apostle (may peace be upon him) saying: The time of the  noon prayer(lasts)as long as it is not afternoon, and the time of the afternoon prayer  (lasts) as long as the sun does not turn pale and the time of the evening prayer (lasts)  as long as the spreading appearance of the redness above the horizon after sunset  does not sink down, and the, time of the night prayer (lasts) by midnight and the time of  the morning prayer (lasts) as long as the sun dots not rise.

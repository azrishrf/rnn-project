1|262|  Chapter: The ruler who is unjust to his subjects deserves punishment of Fire.  Hasan reported: Ubaidullah b. Ziyad went to see Ma’qil b. Yasir and he was ailing. He  (‘Ubaidullah) inquired (about his health) to which he (Ma’qil) replied: I am narrating to  you a hadith which I avoided narrating to you (before). Verily the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) observed: Allah does not entrust to his bondsman the  responsibility of managing the affairs of his subjects and he dies as a dishonest (ruler)  but Paradise is forbidden by Allah for such a (ruler). He (Ibn Ziyad) said: Why did you  not narrate it to me before this day? He replied: I (in fact) did not narrate it to you as it  was not (fit) for me to narrate that to you.

30|5745|  Chapter: The mercy and compassion of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) for women  and his command to the camel-driver to drive the mount slowly on which they ride.  Anas reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came to his wives as the  camel-driver who was called Anjasha had been, driving (the camels) on which (they  were riding). Thereupon he said: Anjasha, be careful, drive slowly for you are driving the  mounts who carry vessels of glass. Abu Qilaba said that Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) uttered words which if someone had uttered amongst you, you would  have found fault with him.           (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

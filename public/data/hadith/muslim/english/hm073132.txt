7|3132|  Chapter: Encamping of pilgrims in Mecca and Inheriting of (the property of their  ancestors).  Usama b. Zaid b. Haritha (Allah be pleased with him) said to Allahâ€™s Messenger  (may peace be upon him): Will you stay in your house at Mecca (which you abandoned  at the time of migration)? Thereupon he said: Has ‘Aqil left for as any land or house?  And ‘Aqil and Talib became the Inheritors of Abu Talib’s (property), and neither Ja’far  nor ‘Ali inherited anything from him, for both (Ja’far and ‘Ali) were Muslims whereas ‘Aqil  and Talib were non-Muslims.

4|750|  Chapter: He who hears the Adhin should respond like it, invoke blessings upon the Apostle  (may peace be upon him)and then beg for him the Wasila.  Yahya narrated it on the authority of his uncle that he had been sitting in the company of  Mu’awiya b. Abu Sufyan when the Mu’adhdhin called (Muslims) to prayer. Mu’awiya         said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saying The Mu’adhdhins  will have the longest necks on the Day of Resurrection.

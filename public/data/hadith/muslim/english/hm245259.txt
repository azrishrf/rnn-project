24|5259|  Chapter: Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.  This hadith has been narrated on the authority of â€˜Aisha through another chain of  transmitters but with a slight variation of wording (and the variation is that the narrator is  reported to have said): He (the Holy Prophet) inclined towards that curtain and tore it  with his hand.

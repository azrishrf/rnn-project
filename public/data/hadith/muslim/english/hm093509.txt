9|3509|  Chapter: Ila and keeping away from wives.  Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) said: I came along with Umar until we reached  Marr al-Zahran (the name of a place), and the rest of the hadith is the same as narrated  by Sulaiman b. Bilal (except with) the variation (of words) that I said: (What) about these  two women? He said: They were Hafsa and Umm Salama. And he made this addition: I  came to the apartments and in every apartment there was (the noise) of weeping. And  this addition was also made: And he (the Holy Prophet) had taken an oath of remaining  away from them for a month, and when twenty-nine days had passed, he visited them.

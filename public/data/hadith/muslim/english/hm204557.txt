20|4557|  Chapter: Instruction to stick to the main body of the Muslims in the time of trials and  warning against those inviting people to disbelief.  It has been narrated (through a different chain of transmitters) on the authority of Abu  Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who defected from  obedience (to the Amir) and separated from the main body of the Muslim-then he died  in that state-would die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahillyya. And he who  is killed under the banner of a man who is blind (to the cause for which he is fighting),  who gets flared up with family pride and fights for his tribe-is not from my Umma, and  whoso from my followers attacks my followers (indiscriminately) killing the righteous and  the wicked of them, sparing not (even) those staunch in faith and fulfilling not his  obligation towards them who have been given a pledge (of security), is not from me (i.e.  is not my follower).

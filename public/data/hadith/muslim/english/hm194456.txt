19|4456|  Chapter: Women participants in jihid to be given a prize but not a regular share in the booty,  and prohibition to kill children of the enemy.  It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Hurmuz that Najda wrote to Ibn Abbas  inquiring of him five things. Ibn Abbas said: If I had not the fear of committing (sin) for  concealing the knowledge I would not have written to him. Najda wrote to him saying  (after praising the Almighty and invoking blessings on the Prophet): Tell me whether the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took women to participate with him in  Jihad; (if he did), whether he allotted them a regular share from the booty; whether he  killed the children of (the enemy in the war how long an orphan would be entitled to  consideration as such and for whom the Kbums (fifth part of the booty) was booty. Ibn  Abbas wrote to him: You have written asking me whether the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) took women with him to participate in Jihad. He did take them to  the battle and sometimes he fought along with them. They would treat the wounded and  were given a reward from the booty, but he did not assign any regular share for them.  And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not kill the children of the  enemy, so thou shouldst not kill the children. Also you have written to me asking me  when the orphan-hood of an orphan comes to an end. By my life, if a man has become         bearded but is still incapable of getting his due from others as well u meeting his  obligation towards them, (he is yet an orphan to be treated you such), but when he can  look after his interests like grown-up people, he is no longer an orphan. And you have  written to me inquiring about Khums as to whom it is meant for. (In this connection) we  (the kinsmen of the Messenger of Allah) used to say: It is for us, but those people (i.e.  Banu Umayya) have denied it to us.

10|3763|  Chapter: If the buyer becomes insolvent and the seller finds the commodity sold to the buyer  intact. he can take it back.  Ibn Umar reported that ‘Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) expelled the  Jews and Christians from the land of Hijaz, and that when Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) conquered Khaibar he made up his mind to expel the Jews from it  (the territory of Khaibar) because, when that land was conquered, it came under the  sway of Allah, that of His Messenger (may peace be upon him) and that of the Muslims.  The Jews asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to let them continue there  on the condition that they would work on it, and would get in turn half of the fruit (of the  trees), whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: We would let you         continue there so long as we will desire. So they continued (to cultivate the lands) till  ‘Umar externed them to Taima’ ang Ariha (two villages in Arabia, but out of Hijaz).

8|3348|  Chapter: When one is invited to a wedding feast, one should accept it.  Abu Haraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) as saying: If any one of you is invited, he should accept (the invitation). In  case he is fasting, he should pray (in order to bless the inmates of the house), and if he  is not fasting he should eat.

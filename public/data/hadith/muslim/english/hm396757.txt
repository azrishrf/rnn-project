39|6757|  Chapter: The mischief of satan in the Muslim society and sending his detachments for the  creation of turmoil, and there is a devil attached to every person.  Abdullah b. Mas’ud reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:  There is none amongst you with whom is not an attack from amongst the jinn (devil).  They (the Companions) said: Allah’s Messenger, with you too? Thereupon he said: Yes,  but Allah helps me against him and so I am safe from his hand and he does not  command me but for good.           PARADISE AND HELL

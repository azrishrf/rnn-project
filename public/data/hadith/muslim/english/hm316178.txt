31|6178|  Chapter: The merits of the people of Persia.  Abu Huraira reported: We were sitting in the company of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) that Sura al-Jumu’a was revealed to him and when he recited (these words):  “Others from amongst them who have not yet joined them,” a person amongst them         (those who were sitting there) said: Allah’s Messenger! But Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him) made no reply, until he questioned him once, twice or thrice. And there  was amongst us Salman the Persian. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  placed his hand on Salman and then said: Even if faith were near the Pleiades, a man  from amongst these would surely find it.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

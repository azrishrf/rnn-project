7|2918|  Chapter: It is permissible to observe Tawaf on the back of a camel or any other riding  beast, and to touch the black stone with a stick.  Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) circumambulated the House on the back of his riding camel on the occasion of the  Farewell Pilgrimage and touched the Stone with his stick so that the people should see  him, and he should be conspicuous, and they should be able to ask him (questions  pertaining to religion) as the people had crowded round him.

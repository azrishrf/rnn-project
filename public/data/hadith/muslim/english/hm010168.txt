1|168|  Chapter: He who dies associating none with Allah would enter Paradise and he who  dies as a polytheist would enter the fire of Hell.  It is narrated on the authority of Jabir that a man came to the Apostle of Allah (may  peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, what are the two things quite  unavoidable? He replied: He who dies without associating anyone with Allah would  (necessarily) enter Paradise and he who dies associating anything with Allah would  enter the (Fire of) Hell.

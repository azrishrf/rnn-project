6|2486|  Chapter: The reward of one who does not observe fast because of a religious duty.  Qaza’a reported: I came to Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) and he was  surrounded (by people), and when they dispersed I said to him: I am not going to ask  you about what these people were asking. I ask you about fasting on a journey. Upon  this he said: We travelled with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  towards Mecca and we had been observing fast. We halted at a place. There the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: You are nearing your enemy and  breaking of fast would give you greater strength, and that was a concession (given to  us). But some of us continued to observe the fast and some of us broke it. We then got  down at another place and he (the Holy Prophet) said: You are going to encounter the  enemy in the morning and breaking of the fast would give you strength, so break the  fast. As it was a point of stress, so we broke the fast. But subsequently we saw  ourselves observing the fast with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on a  journey.

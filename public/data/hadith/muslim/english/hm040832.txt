4|832|  Chapter: The Muqtadi (follower) should strictly follow the Imam in prayer.  Ubaidullah b. Abdullah reported: I visited ‘Aisha and asked her to tell about the illness of  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She agreed and said: The Apostle  (may peace be upon him) was seriously ill and he asked whether the people had  prayed. We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy  Prophet) said: Put some water in the tub for me. We did accordingly and he (the Holy  Prophet) took a bath; and when he was about to move with difficulty, he fainted. When  he came round, he again said: Have the people said prayer? We said: No, they are  waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) again said: Put some water  for me in the tub. We did accordingly and he took a bag, but when he was about to  move with difficulty he fainted. When he came round, he asked whether the people had  prayed. We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. He said: Put some  water for me in the tub. We did accordingly and he took a bath and he was about to  move with difficulty when he fainted. When he came round he said: Have the people  said prayer? We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. She (‘Aisha)  said: The people were staying in the mosque and waiting for the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) to lead the last (night) prayer. She (‘Aisha) said: The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent (instructions) to Abu Bakr to lead the         people in prayer. When the messenger came, he told him (Abd Bakr): The Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) has ordered you to lead the people in prayer. Abu  Bakr who was a man of very tenderly feelings asked Umar to lead the prayer. ‘Umar  said: You are more entitled to that. Abu Bakr led the prayers during those days.  Afterwards the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) felt some relief and he  went out supported by two men, one of them was al-‘Abbas, to the noon prayer. Abu  Bakr was leading the people in prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him, he began to withdraw,  but the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) told him not to withdraw. He told his  two (companions) to seat him down beside him (Abu Bakr). They seated him by the side  of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr said the prayer standing while following the prayer of the Apostle  (way peace be upon him) and the people Bald prayer (standing) while following the  prayer of Abu Bakr. The Apostle (may peace be upon him) was seated. Ubaidullah said:  I visited ‘Abdullah b. ‘Abbas, and said: Should I submit to you what ‘Aisha had told  about the illness of the Apostle (may peace be upon him)?He said: Go ahead. I  submitted to him what had been transmitted by her (‘Aisha). He objected to none of it,  only asking whether she had named to him the man who accompanied al-‘Abbas. I said:  No. He said: It was ‘Ali.

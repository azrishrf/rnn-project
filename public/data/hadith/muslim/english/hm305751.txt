30|5751|  Chapter: The nearness of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) to the people and their  seeking blessings from his (and his possessions).  Anas reported that a woman had a partial derangement in her mind, so she said. Allah’s  Messenger, I want something from you. He said: Mother of so and so, see on which  side of the road you would like (to stand and talk) so that I may do the needful for you.  He stood aside with her on the roadside until she got what she needed.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

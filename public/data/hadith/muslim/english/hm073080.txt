7|3080|  Chapter: The demolishing of the ka’ba and its reconstruction.  ‘Aisha, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), reported Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) as having said this: Didn’t you see that when your  people built the Ka’ba, they reduced (its area with the result that it no longer remains)  on the foundations (laid) by Ibrahim. I said: Messenger of Allah, why don’t you rebuild it  on the foundations (laid by) Ibrahim? Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) said: Had your people not been new converts to Islam, I would have done  that, ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) said: If ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased  with her) had heard it from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), I would not  have seen Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) abandoning the touching of the  two corners situated near al-Hijr, but (for the fact) that it was not completed on the  foundations (laid) by Ibrahim.

42|7122|  Chapter: The Punishment of one who Commands others to do good but does not do it  himself and he forbids others to do evil but does not himself refrain from it.  Shaqiq reported that it was said to Usama b. Zaid: Why don’t you visit ‘Uthman and talk  to him? Thereupon he said: Do you think that I have not talked to him but that I have  made you hear? By Allah. I have talked to him (about things) concerning me and him  and I did not like to divulge those things about which I had to take the initiative and I do  not say to my ruler: “You are the best among people,” after I beard Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) as saying: A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection  and thrown in Hell-Fire and his intestines will pour forth in Hell and he will go round  along with them, as an ass goes round the mill-stone. The denizens of Hell would  gather round him and say: O, so and so, what has happened to you? Were you not  enjoining us to do what was reputable and forbid us to do what was disreputable? He  will say: Of course, it is so; I used to enjoin (upon people) to do what was reputable but  did not practise that myself. I had been forbidding people to do what was disreputable,  but practised it myself.

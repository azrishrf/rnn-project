18|4260|  Chapter: It is forbidden to ask many questions, and wasting of wealth.  Warrad reported that al-Mughira wrote to Mu’awiya: Peace be upon you, and then  coming to the point (I should say) that I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) as saying: Verily Allah has Prohibited three things and has forbidden three things.  He has declared absolutely haram the disobedience of father, burying of daughters  alive, and withholding that which you have power to return, and has forbidden three  things: irrelevant talk, persistent questioning, and wasting of wealth.

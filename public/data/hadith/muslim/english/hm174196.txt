17|4196|  Chapter: He who confesses his guilt of adultery.  Abu Huraira reported that a person from amongst the Muslims came to Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) while he was in the mosque. He called him  saying: Allah’s Messenger. I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned  away from him, He (again) came round facing him and said to him: Allah’s Messenger, I  have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away until he did that four times,  and as he testified four times against his own self, Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) called him and said: Are you mad? He said: No. He (again) said: Are you  married? He said: Yes. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:  Take him and stone him. Ibn Shihab (one of the narrators) said: One who had heard  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah saying this informed me thus: I was one of those who stoned him. We  stoned him at the place of prayer (either that of ‘Id or a funeral). When the stones hurt         him, he ran away. We caught him in the Harra and stoned him (to death). This hadith  has been narrated through another chain of transmitters.

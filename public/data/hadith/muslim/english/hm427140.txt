42|7140|  Chapter: It is prohibited to praise anyone so much that there may be fear of his being  intoxicated because of that.  Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakra reported on the authority of his father that a person was  mentioned in the presence of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and a person  said: Allah’s Messenger, no person is more excellent than he after Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him). Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said:  Woe be to thee, you have broken the neck of your friend, and he said this twice. Then  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If anyone has to praise his brother at  all, he should say: I think him to be so and so, and even on this he should say: I do not  consider anyone purer than Allah (considers). This hadith has been transmitted on the  authority of Shu’ba with a slight variation of wording.

8|3252|  Chapter: Temporary marriage and its prohibition for all times to come.  Sabra Juhanni reported: Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) permitted  temporary marriage for us. So I and another person went out and saw a woman of Bana  ‘Amir, who was like a young long-necked she-camel. We presented ourselves to her (for  contracting temporary marriage), whereupon she said: What dower would you give me?  I said: My cloak. And my companion also said: My cloak. And the cloak of-my  companion was superior to my cloak, but I was younger than he. So when she looked at  the cloak of my companion she liked it, and when she cast a glance at me I looked more  attractive to her. She then said: Well, you and your cloak are sufficient for me. I  remained with her for three nights, and then Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon  him) said: He who has any such woman with whom he had contracted temporary  marriage, he should let her off.

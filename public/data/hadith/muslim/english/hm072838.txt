7|2838|  Chapter: Permissibility of putting off Ihram (in the midst of Hajj ceremonies) in case of  obstruction and permissibility of Qiran.  Nafi’ reported that ‘Abdullah b. Umar (Allah be pleased with them) set out for Umra  during the turmoil, and he said: If I am detained (from going to) the House, we would do  the same as we did with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). So he went out  and put on Ihram for ‘Umra and moved on until he reached al-Baida’. He turned towards  his Companions and said: There is one command for both of them and I call you as my  witness (and say) that verify I have made Hajj with ‘Umra compulsory for me. He  proceeded until, when he came to the House, he circumambulated it seven times and  ran between al-Safa’ and al-Marwa seven times, and made no addition to it and thought  it to be sufficient for him and offered sacrifice.

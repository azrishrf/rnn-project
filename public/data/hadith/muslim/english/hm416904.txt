41|6904|  Chapter: This Ummah would be destroyed by killing one another.  Thauban reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah drew the  ends of the world near one another for my sake. And I have seen its eastern and  western ends. And the dominion of my Unimah would reach those ends which have  been drawn near me and I have been granted the red and the white treasure and I  begged my Lord for my Ummah that it should not be destroyed because of famine, nor  be dominated by an enemy who is not amongst them to take their lives and destroy  them root and branch, and my Lord said: Muhammad, whenever I make a decision,  there is none to change it. Well, I grant you for your Ummah that it would not be  destroyed by famine and it would not be dominated by an enemy who would not be  amongst it and would take their lives and destroy them root and branch even if all the  people from the different parts of the world join hands together (for this purpose), but it  would be from amongst them, viz. your Ummah, that some people would kill the others  or imprison the others.

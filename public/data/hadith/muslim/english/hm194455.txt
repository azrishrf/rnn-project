19|4455|  Chapter: Fighting of women side by side with men.  It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said: On the Day of Ubud  some of the people, being defeated, left the Holy Prophet (may peace he upon him), but  Abu Talha stood before him covering him with a shield. Abu Talha was a powerful  archer who broke two or three bows that day. When a man would pass by carrying a  quiver containing arrows, he would say: Spare them for Abu Talha. Whenever the Holy  Prophet (way peace be upon him) raised his head to look at the people, Abd Talba  would say: Prophet of Allah, may my father and my mother be thy ransom, do not raise  your head lest you be struck by an arrow shot by the enemy. My neck is before your  neck. The narrator said: I saw ‘Aisha bint Abu Bakr and Umm Sulaim. Both of them had  tucked up their garments, so I could me the anklets on their feet. They were carrying  water-skins on their backs and would pour water into the mouths of the people. They  would then go back (to the well), would fill them again and would return to pour water  into the mouths of the soldiers. (On this day). Abu Talha’s sword dropped down from his  hands twice or thrice because of drowsiness.

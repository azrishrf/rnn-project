4|840|  Chapter: The Muqtadi (follower) should strictly follow the Imam in prayer.  Anas b. Malik reported, Abu Bakr led them in prayer due to the illness of the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) of which he died. It was a Monday and they stood in  rows for prayer. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) drew aside the  curtain of (‘Aisha’s) apartment and looked at us while he was standing, and his  (Prophet’s) face was (as bright) as the paper of the Holy Book. The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) felt happy and smiled. And we were confounded with joy  while in prayer due to the arrival (among our midst) of the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him), Abu Bakr stepped back upon his heels to say prayer in a row  perceiving that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had come out for  prayer. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) with the help of his hand  signed to them to complete their prayer. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) went back (to his apartment) and drew the curtain. He (the narrator) said: The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) breathed his last on that very day.

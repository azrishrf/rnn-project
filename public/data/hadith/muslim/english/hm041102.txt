4|1102|  Chapter: Sitting on the buttocks.  Jabir reported: We were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him), and he sent me on an errand, and when I came back (I saw him) saying prayer on  his ride and his face was not turned towards Qibla. I greeted him but he did not respond  to me. As he completed the prayer, he said: Nothing prevented me from responding to  your greeting but the fact that I was praying.

4|1940|  Chapter: Permission for sport on ‘Id days in which there in no sin.  ‘Aisha reported that Abu Bakr came to her and there were with her two girls on Adha  days who were singing and beating the tambourine and the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) had wrapped himself with his mantle. Abu Bakr scolded them. The  Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) uncovered (his face) and said: Abu Bakr,  leave them alone for these are the days of ‘Id. And ‘Aisha said: I recapitulate to my mind  the fact that once the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) screened me with  his mantle and I saw the sports of the Abyssinians, and I was only a girl, and so you can  well imagine how a girl of tender age is fond of watching the sport.

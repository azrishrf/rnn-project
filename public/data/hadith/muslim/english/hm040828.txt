4|828|  Chapter: The reciting of Tasmi’ (Allah listens to him who praises Him) Tahmid (O our Lord, for  Thee is the praise), and Timin (Amin).  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) while teaching  us (the principles of faith), said: Do not try to go ahead of the Imam, recite takbir when  he recites it and when he says: “Nor of those who err,” you should say Amin, bow down  when lie bows down, and when he says: “Allah listens to him who praises Him,” say: “O  Allah, our Lord, to Thee be the praise”.

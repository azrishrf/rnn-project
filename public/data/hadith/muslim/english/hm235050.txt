23|5050|  Chapter: The merit of licking the fingers after taking food and wiping the dish (with fingers) and  eating of the fallen mouthful after removing the dirt sticking to it.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When any  one of you cats food he should lick his fingers, for hen does not know in what part of the  food sticking to his fingers the blessing lies. This hadith has been reported on the  authority of Hammad with the same chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of  wording.

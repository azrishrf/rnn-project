4|1858|  Chapter: There is a special (fortunate) time on Friday.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: We who  are the last shall be the first on the Day of Resurrection, except that every Ummah was  given the Book before us and we were given it after them. It was this day which Allah  prescribed for us and guided us to it and the people came after us with regard to it, the  Jews observing the next day and the Christians the day following that.

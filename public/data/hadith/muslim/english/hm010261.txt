1|261|  Chapter: The ruler who is unjust to his subjects deserves punishment of Fire.  Hasan reported: ‘Ubaidullah b. Ziyad paid a visit to Ma’qil b. Yasar Muzani in his illness  of which he (later on) died. (At this juncture) Ma’qil said: I am going to narrate to you a  hadith which I have heard from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and  which I would not have transmitted if I knew that I would survive. Verily I have heard the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: There is none amongst the         bondsmen who was entrusted with the affairs of his subjects and he died in such a state  that he was dishonest in his dealings with those over whom he ruled that the Paradise is  not forbidden for him.

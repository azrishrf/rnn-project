4|1472|  Chapter: Compensation of the missed prayer and excellence of observing it promptly.         Jubair b. Nufair reported: I went along with Shurahbil b. al-Simt to a village which was  situated at a distance of seventeen or eighteen miles, and he said only two rak’ahs of  prayer. I said to him (about it) and he said: I saw ‘Umar observing two rak’ahs at Dhu’l- Hulaifa and I (too) said to him (about it) and he said: I am doing the same as I saw the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) doing. (This Hadith has been transmitted  by Shu’ba with the same chain of narrators and it is narrated from Simt, and the name  of Shurahbil has not been mentioned, and he said that he had gone to a place called  Dumin, situated at a distance of eighteen miles from him.)

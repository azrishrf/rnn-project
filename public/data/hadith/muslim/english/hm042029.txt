4|2029|  Chapter: The dead body is punished for the lamentation of his family.  ‘Amra daughter of ‘Abd al Rahman narrated that she heard (from) ‘Aisha and made a  mention to her about ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar as saying: The dead is punished because of  the lamentation of the living. Upon this ‘Aisha said: May Allah have mercy upon the  father of ‘Abd al-Rahman (Ibn ‘Umar). He did not tell a lie, but he forgot or made a  mistake. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) happened to pass by a  (dead) Jewess who was being lamented. Upon this he said: They weep over her and  she is being punished in the grave.

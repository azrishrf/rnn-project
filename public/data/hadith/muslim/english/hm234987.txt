23|4987|  Chapter: Command pertaining to the covering of vessels, and tightening (the mouths) of  waterskins, etc.  Abu Humaid Sa’idi reported: I came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  with a cup of milk from Naqi’ which had no cover over it, whereupon he said: Why did  you not cover it? – even if you had covered it only with a stick. Abu Humaid said that he  had been ordered that water-skins be tied during the night, and the doors be closed  during the night.

5|2241|  Chapter: Exhortation to spend (for the sake of Allah) and disapproval of calculating (the articles  of charity).  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who  spent pairs for the sake of Allah, the guardians of Paradise would call him, (in fact)  every guardian of the door (of Paradise would welcome him saying): O, so and so,  come on. Upon this Abu Bakr said: Messenger of Allah, (it means) there would be no  distress on this person. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I hope  you would be among them.

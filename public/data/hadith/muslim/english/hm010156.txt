He (the reporter) said: I asked him  what the next (gravest sin) was. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you kill your child  out of fear that he shall join you in food. He (the reporter)said: I asked (him) what the  next (gravest sin)was. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Then (the next gravest sin) is  that you commit adultery with the wife of your neighbour.

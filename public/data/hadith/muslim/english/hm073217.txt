7|3217|  Chapter: The merit of praying in the two mosques, at Mecca and Medina.  Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that a woman fell ill and she said: In  case Allah cures me I will certainly go and observe prayer in Bait al-Maqdis. She  recovered and so she made preparations to go out (to that place). She came to  Maimuna, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and after greeting her  she informed her about it, whereupon she said: Stay here and eat the provision (which  you had made) and observe prayer In the mosque of the Messenger (may peace be  upon him), for I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say: Prayer In it is         better than a thousand prayers observed in other mosques except the mosque of the  Ka’ba.

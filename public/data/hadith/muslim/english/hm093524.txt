9|3524|  Chapter: There is no maintenance allowance for one who has been given irrevocable  divorce.  Abu Ishaq reported: I was with al-Aswad b. Yazid sitting in the great mosque, and there  was with us al-Sha’bi, and he narrated the narration of Fatima bint Qais (Allah be         pleased with her) that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not make any  provision for lodging and maintenance allowance for her. Al-Aswad caught hold of some  pebbles in his fist and he threw them towards him saying: Woe be to thee, you narrate  like it, whereas Umar said: We cannot abandon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of our  Apostle (may peace be upon him) for the words of a woman. We do not know whether  she remembers that or she forgets. For her, there is a provision of lodging and  maintenance allowance. Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, said: “Turn them not from their  houses nor should they themselves go forth unless they commit an open indecency”  (lxv. 1).

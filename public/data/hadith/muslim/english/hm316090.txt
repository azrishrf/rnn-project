31|6090|  Chapter: The merits of those who owed allegiance under the tree (Allah be pleased with them).  Umm Mubashshir reported that she heard Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as  saying in presence of Hafsa: God willing, the people of the Tree would never enter the  fire of Hell one amongst those who owed allegiance under that. She said: Allah’s  Messenger, why not? He scolded her. Hafsa said: And there is none amongst you but  shall have to pass over that (narrow Bridge). Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has said: We would rescue those         persons who are God-conscious and we would leave the tyrants to their fate there (xix.  72).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

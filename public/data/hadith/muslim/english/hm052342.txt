5|2342|  Chapter: The posterity of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) is not allowed to make  use of Sadaqa.         Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I go back  to my family and I find a date lying on my bed. I then take it up to eat it, but then I throw  it away fearing that it may be a Sadaqa.

20|4580|  Chapter: It is good on the part of a leader to take the oath of allegiance from his forces  when intending to fight, and an account of the allegiance of Godâ€™s pleasure under the  tree.  It has been narrated (through a different chain of transmitters) on the authority of Jabir  who said: We were one thousand and four hundred on the Day of Hudaibiya when the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said to us: Today you are the best people on  the earth. And Jabir said: If I had the eyesight, I could show you the place of the tree.

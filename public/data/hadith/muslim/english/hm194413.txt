19|4413|  Chapter: The battle of Uhud.  It has been reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that (when the enemy got the  upper hand) on the day of the Battle of Uhud, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) was left with only seven men from the ansar and two men from the Quraish.  When the enemy advanced towards him and overwhelmed him, he said: Whoso turns  them away from us will attain Paradise or will be my Companion in Paradise. A man  from the Ansar came forward and fought (the enemy) until he was killed. The enemy  advanced and overwhelmed him again and he repeated the words: Whoso turns them  away, from us will attain Paradise or will be my Companion in Paradise. A man from the         Arsar came forward and fought until he was killed. This state continued until the seven  Ansar were killed (one after the other). Now, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said to his two Companions: We have not done justice to our Companions.

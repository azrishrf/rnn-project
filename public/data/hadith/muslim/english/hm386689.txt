38|6689|  Chapter: Not known.  Qais b. ‘Ubad reported: We said to ‘Ammar: Was your fighting (on the side of ‘Ali in the  Battle of Siffin) a matter of your own choice or you got its hints from Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) for it, is likely for one to err in one’s own discretion or was it  because of any covenant that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got from  you? He said: It was not because of any covenant that Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) got from us which he did get from other people, and he further said that  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: “In my Ummah.” And I think that  Hudhaifa reported to me and according to Ghundar (the words are) that he said: In my  Ummah, there would be twelve hypocrites and they would not be admitted to Paradise  and they would not smell its odour, until the camel would pass through a needle’s hole.  Dubaila (ulcer) would be enough to (torment them)-a kind of flame of Fire which would  appear in their shoulders and it would protrude from their chest.  COMMAND CONCERNING THEM

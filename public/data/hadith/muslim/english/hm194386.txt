19|4386|  Chapter: The battle of Hunain.  A version of the tradition has been transmitted through another chain of narrators. In  this version the words uttered by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) (after he  had thrown the pebbles in the face of the enemy) are reported as: “By the Lord of the  Ka’ba, they have been defeated.” And there is at the end the addition of the words:  “Until Allah defeated them” (and I imagine) as if I saw the Prophet of Allah (may peace  be upon him) chasing them on his mule.

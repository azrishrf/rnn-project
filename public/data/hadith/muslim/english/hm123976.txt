12|3976|  Chapter: Al-‘Umra (Life grant).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) commanded that whoever is conferred upon a life grant along with  his descendants is entitled to make use of the property conferred so long as he lives  and his successors (also enjoy this privilege). That (property) becomes the their defect  belonging. The donor cannot (after declaring Umra) lay down any condition or make any  exception. Abu Salama said: For he conferred a grant and as such it becomes heritage  and the right of inheritance abrogated his condition.

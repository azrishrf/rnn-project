It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be  upon him) observed: People will constantly ask you questions pertaining to knowledge  till they would say: Allah created us, but who created Allah? he (the narrator) says: he  (Abu Huraira) was (at the time of narrating this hadith) catching hold of the hand of a  man and he said: Allah and the Messenger told the truth. Two persons have already put  me this question, and this is the third one, or he said: One man has put me this question  and he is the second one.

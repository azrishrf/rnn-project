4|1796|  Chapter: “The Qur’an has been revealed in seven modes of “reading” and its meaning.  Abu Wa’il reported: A person came to ‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud and said: I recited all the  mufassal surahs in one rak’ah during the night. ‘Abdullah said: You must have recited  hastily like the recitation of poetry. ‘Abdullah said: I remember well the manner in which         the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to combine them, and he then  mentioned twenty of the mufassal surahs, and (their combinations in) two in every  rak’ah.

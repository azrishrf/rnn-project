4|1992|  Chapter: Mention of the torment of grave in eclipse prayer.  ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Samura, who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: During the lifetime of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) I was shooting some of my arrows in Medina, when the sun eclipsed. I threw  (the arrows) and said: By Allah, I must see how the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) acts in solar eclipse. So I came to him and he was standing in prayer, raising  his hands, glorifying Him, praising Him, acknowledging His Oneness, declaring His  greatness, and supplicating Him, till the sun cleared. When the eclipse was over, he  recited two surahs and prayed two rak’ahs.

6|2520|  Chapter: Fasting on the day of ‘Ashura (1Oth of Muharram).         Ibn’Abbas (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) arrived in Medina and found the Jews observing fast on the  day of ‘Ashura. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to them: What is  the (significance) of this day that you observe fast on it? They said: It is the day of great  (significance) when Allah delivered Moses and his people, and drowned the Pharaoh  and his people, and Moses observed fast out of gratitude and we also observe it. Upon  this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: We have more right, and we  have a closer connection with Moses than you have; so Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) observed fast (on the day of ‘Ashura), and gave orders that it should be  observed.

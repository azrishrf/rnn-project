20|4480|  Chapter: The people are subservient to the Quraish and the Caliphate is the right of the  Quraish.  It has been narrated on the authority of Jabir b. Samura who said: I heard the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: Islam will continue to be triumphant  until there have been twelve Caliphs. Then the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him)  said something which I could not understand. I asked my father: What did he say? He  said: He has said that all of them (twelve Caliphs) will be from the Quraish.

1|397|  Chapter: Prayer of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) for his Ummah and his being  moved to tears on account of his affection for them.  ‘Abdullah b. Amr b. al-‘As reported: Verily the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  recited the words of Allah, the Great and Glorious, that Ibrahim uttered. My Lord ! lo!  they have led many of mankind astray: “But whoso followeth me, he verily is of me” (al- Qur’an, xiv. 35) and Jesus (peace be upon him) said: “If thou punisheth them, lo! they  are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgiveth them-verily Thou art the Mighty, the Wise” (al- Qur’an, v 117). Then he raised his hands and said: O Lord, my Ummah, my Ummah,  and wept; so Allah the High and the Exalted said: O Gabriel, go to Muhammad (though  your Lord knows it fully well) and ask him: What makes thee weep? So Gabriel (peace  be upon him) came to him and asked him, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) informed him what he had said (though Allah knew it fully well). Upon this  Allah said: O Gabriel, go to Muhammad any say: Verily We will please thee with regard  to your Ummah and would not displease thee.

5|2225|  Chapter: The likeness of one who spends (in the path of Allah) and one who withholds.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira (that the Messenger of Allah) said: Of  course the person who gives to the family a she-camel as a gift, which gives milk  morning and evening equal to a large bowl, its reward (the reward of the gift) is great.

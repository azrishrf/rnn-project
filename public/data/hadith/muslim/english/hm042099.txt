4|2099|  Chapter: Abrogation of the act of standing up the bier.  It is narrated on the authority of Waqid: Nafi’ b. Jubair saw me and we were standing for  a bier, while he was sitting and waiting for the bier to be placed on the ground. He said  to me: What makes you keep standing? I said: I am waiting that the bier may be placed  on the ground (and I am doing that) on the Hadith narrated to me by Abu Sa’id al- Khudri. Upon this Nafi’ said: Verily, Mas’ud b. Hakam reported to me on the authority of  Hadrat ‘Ali b. Abu Talib that the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) stood up first  (for a bier) and then sat down.

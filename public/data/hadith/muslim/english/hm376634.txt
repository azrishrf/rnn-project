37|6634|  Chapter: The mercy of Allah predominates his wrath.  Salman reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah  created, on the same very day when He created the heavens and the earth, one  hundred parts of mercy. Every part of mercy is coextensive with the space between the  heavens and the earth and He out of this mercy endowed one part to the earth and it is  because of this that the mother shows affection to her child and even the beasts and         birds show kindness to one another and when there would be the Day of Resurrection,  Allah would make full (use of Mercy).

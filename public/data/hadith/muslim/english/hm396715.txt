39|6715|  Chapter: The question of a Jew from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about soul  and his words: “They ask thee about the soul”.  Khabbab reported that al-As b. Wa’il owed debt to me. I came to him in order to demand  that. He said: I will never repay you unless you belie Muhammad. I said: I would never  belie Muhammad until you die and you are again raised up. He said: When I would be  raised up after death, I would repay your debt when I would get my property and  children back. Waki’ said: This is how A’mash has narrated and it was on this occasion  that this verse was revealed: “Hast thou seen him who disbelieves in Our message and  says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children’ (xis, 77) up to “he would come to Us  alone” (xix. 80).

2|478|  Chapter: It is commendable to include forehead in washing the face and elbow and  ankle in washing the hands and feet, while performing ablution.  Nu’aim b. ‘Abdallah reported: He saw Abu Huraira perform ablution. He washed his face  and washed his hands up to the arms. He then washed his feet and reached up to the         shanks and then said: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say: My  people would come with bright faces and bright hands and feet on account of the marks  of ablution, so he who can increase the lustre of his forehead (and that of his hands and  legs) should do so.

1|75|  Chapter: Concerning exhortation to accord honour and respect to the neighbour and  the guest and obligation to observe silence except in goodness, and all these qualities  come within the orbit of Iman.  It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) observed: He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should either utter good  words or better keep silence; and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day should  treat his neighbour with kindness and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day should  show hospitality to his guest.

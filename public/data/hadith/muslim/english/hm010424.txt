1|424|  Chapter: The admittance into Paradise of a group of Muslims without rendering any  account and suffering punishment (torment).  Abu Hazim narrated it on the authority of Ibn Saâ€™d that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: Seventy thousand persons or seven hundred thousand  persons (Abu Hazim does not remember the exact number) would enter Paradise  holding and supporting one another, and the first among them would not enter till the  last among them would enter (therein); (they would enter simultaneously) and their  faces would be bright like the full moon.

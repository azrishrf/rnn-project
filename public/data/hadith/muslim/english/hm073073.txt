7|3073|  Chapter: The merit of entering the ka’ba for a pilgrim and observing of prayer in it.  Salim narrated on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with him) that Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) entered the House along with Usama b. Zaid,  Bilal and Uthman b. Talha.

He said: Yes, he observed prayer between  these two Yemenite pillars (pillars situated towards the side of Yemen).

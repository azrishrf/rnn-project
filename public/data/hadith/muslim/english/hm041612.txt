4|1612|  Chapter: Permissibility of observing Nafl (voluntary prayer) standing or sitting and observing  some part of it standing or sitting.  ‘Aisha thus reported about the (night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him): He used to sleep in the early part of the night, and woke up in the latter part.  If he then wished intercourse with his wife, he satisfied his desire, and then went to  sleep; and when the first call to prayer was made he jumped up (by Allah, she, i.e.  ‘Aisha, did not say “he stood up”), and poured water over him (by Allah she, i.e. ‘Aisha,  did not say that he took a bath but I know what she meant) and if he did not have an  intercourse, he performed ablution, just as a man performs ablution for prayer and then  observed two rak’ahs.

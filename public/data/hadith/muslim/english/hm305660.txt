30|5660|  Chapter: The miracles of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  Jabir reported that Umm Malik used to send clarified butter in a small skin to the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him). Her sons would come to her and ask for seasoning when they had  nothing with them (in the form of condiments) and she would go to that (skin) in which she offered  (clarified butter) to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and she would find in that clarified         butter  and  it kept  providing  her  with  seasoning  for  her  household  until  she  had  (completely)  squeezed it. She came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and (informed him about it).  Thereupon, he (the Holy Prophet) said: Did you squeeze it? She said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If  you had left it in that very state, it would have kept on providing you (the clarified butter) on end.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

4|1799|  Chapter: Reciting the Qur’an leisurely and distinctively and abstaining from reciting it  too hurriedly, and permission to recite two suras of more than two in a Rak’ah.  ‘Alqama reported. We went to Syria and Abu Darda’ came to us and said: Is there  anyone among you who recites according to the recitation of Abdullah? I said: Yes, it is  I. He again said: How did you hear ‘Abdullah reciting this verse: (wa’l-lail-i-idha yaghsha  = when the night covers)? He (‘Alqama) said: I heard him reciting it (like this) (wa’l-lail-i- idha yaghsha) wa-dhakar wal untha = when the night covers and the males and the  females). Upon this he said: By Allah, I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) reciting in this way, but they (the Muslims of Syria) desire us to recite: (wa ma  khalaqa), but I do not yield to their desire.

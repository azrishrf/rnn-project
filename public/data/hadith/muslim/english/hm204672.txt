20|4672|  Chapter: The merit of helping the warrior (fighting in the way of Allah) with something to  ride upon and looking after his family in his absence.  It has been narrated (through a still different chain of transmitters) on the authority of  Abu Saâ€™id Khudrl that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) despatched a  force to Banu Lihyan. (and said:) One man from every two should join the force. Then  he said to those who stayed behind: Those of you who will look well after the family and  wealth of those who are going on the expedition will be getting half the reward of the  warriors.

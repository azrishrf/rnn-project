1|395|  Chapter: Pertaining to the words of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him): “I  would be the first among people to Intercede in the Paradise and among the Apostles I  would have the largest following”.  Muhammad b. ‘Abd al-A’la reported it to me: Mu’tamir narrated to us on the authority of  his father who transmitted it to Anas that verity the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon  him) said, and then narrated the hadith like the one transmitted by Qatada on the  authority of Anas.

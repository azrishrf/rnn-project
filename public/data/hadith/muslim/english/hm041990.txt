4|1990|  Chapter: Mention of the torment of grave in eclipse prayer.  Abu Musa reported: The sun eclipsed during the time of the Apostle of Allah (may  peace be upon him). He stood in great anxiety fearing that it might be the Doomsday, till  he came to the mosque. He stood up to pray with prolonged qiyam, ruku’, and  prostration which I never saw him doing in prayer; and then he said: These are the  signs which Allah sends, not on account of the death of anyone or life of any one, but         Allah sends them to frighten thereby His servants. So when you see any such thing,  hasten to remember Him, supplicate Him and beg pardon from Him, and in the narration  transmitted by Ibn ‘Ala the words are: “The sun eclipsed”.” “He frightens His servants.”

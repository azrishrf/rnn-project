4|1881|  Chapter: Concerning the two sermons before the Friday prayer and sitting for a while  between the two.  Ka’b b. ‘Ujra reported that he entered the mosque and saw Abd al-Rahman b. Umm  Hakam delivering the sermon in a sitting posture. Upon this he said: Look at this  wretched person; he delivers the sermon while sitting, whereas Allah said: “And when  they see merchandise or sport, they break away to it and leave thee standing.”

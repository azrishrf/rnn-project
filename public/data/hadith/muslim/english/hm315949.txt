31|5949|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Ubaida b. Jarrah (Allah be pleased with him).  Hudhaifa reported that the people of Najran came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) and said: Allah’s Messenger, send along with us a man of trust; whereupon  he said: I would definitely send to you a man of trust, a man of trust in the true sense of         the term. Thereupon his Companions looked up eagerly and he sent Abu Ubaida b.  Jarrah.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

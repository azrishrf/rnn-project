31|5959|  Chapter: Merits of Zaid b. Harith and Usama b. Zaid (Allah be pleased with them).  Salim reported on the authority of his father that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) said on the pulpit: You object to the command of Usima b. Zaid as you had  objected before to the command of his father (Zaid). By Allah, he was most competent  for it and, by Allah, he was dearest to me amongst people and, by Allah, the same is the  case with Usama b. Zaid. He is most dear to me after him and I advise you to treat him  well for he is pious amongst you.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

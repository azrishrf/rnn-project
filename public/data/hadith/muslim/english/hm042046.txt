4|2046|  Chapter: Washing of the dead body.  Umm ‘Atiyya reported: When Zainab the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) died, he said to us: Wash her odd number of times, i.e. three or five  times, and put camphor or something-like camphor at the fifth time, and after you have  washed her inform me. So we informed him and he gave us his under-garment, saying:  “Put it next her body.”

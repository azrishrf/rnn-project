30|5763|  Chapter: The fragrance of the sacred body of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its  agility and softness and the blessings of its touch.  Umm Sulaim reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) visited her house  and (took rest) and she spread a piece of cloth for him and he had had a siesta on it.  And he sweated profusely and she collected his sweat and put it in a perfume and in  bottles. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Umm Sulaim, what is this? She  said: It is your sweat, which I put in my perfume. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) sweated in cold weather when revelation descended upon him.         (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

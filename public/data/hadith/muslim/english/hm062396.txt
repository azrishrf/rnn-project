6|2396|  Chapter: The timing of fast begins with the dawn.  ‘Adi b. Hatim (Allah be pleased with him) reported that when (this verse) was revealed:  “Until the white streak of the dawn becomes distinct from the dark streak” (ii. 187) Adi b.  Hatim said: Messenger of Allah, verily I keep underneath my pillow two strings, one  white and the other black, by which I distinguish night from dawn. Upon this the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Your pillow seems to be very large.  For the word khait implies the blackness of the night and the whiteness of the dawn.

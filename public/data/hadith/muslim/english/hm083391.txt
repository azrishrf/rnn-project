8|3391|  Chapter: Permissibility of intercourse with a suckling lady and disapproval of ‘Azl.  Judaima daughter of Wahb al-Asadiyya (Allah be pleased with her) reported that she  heard Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) assaying: I intended to prohibit         cohabitation with a suckling woman until I considered that the Romans and the Persians  do it without any injury being caused to their children thereby. (Imam Muslim said:  Khalaf reported it from Judamat al-‘Asadiyya, but the correct wording is what has been  stated by Yahya.)

8|3433|  Chapter: It is permissible to have sexual intercourse with a captive woman after she is purified  (of menses or delivery) in case she has a husband; her marriage is abrogated after she  becomes captive.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah’s Apostle (May  peace be upon him) sent a small army. The rest of the hadith is the same except this  that he said: Except what your right hands possess out of them are lawful for you; and         he did not mention: “when their ‘idda period comes to an end”. This hadith has been  reported on the authority of AbuSa’id (al-Khudri) (Allah be pleased with him) through  another chain of transmitters and the words are: They took captives (women) on the day  of Autas who had their husbands. They were afraid (to have sexual intercourse with  them) when this verse was revealed: “And women already married except those whom  you right hands posses” (iv. 24)

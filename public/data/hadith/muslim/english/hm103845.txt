10|3845|  Chapter: Sale of wheat like for like.  Abu Salid al-Khudri reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do  not sell gold for gold, except like for like, and don’t increase something of it upon  something; and don’t sell silver unless like for like, and don’t increase something of it  upon something, and do not sell for ready money something to be given later.

7|3207|  Chapter: Uhud is a mountain: it loves us and we love it.         Abu Humaid (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We went out along with Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the expedition of Tabuk, and Humaid further  related: We proceeded until we reached the valley of Qura; and Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: I am going forth, so he who among you wants to move fast  with me may do so; and he who likes to go slowly may do so. We proceeded until  Medina wag within our sight and he said: This is Tibba (another name of Medina); this is  Ubud, the mountain which loves us and we love it.

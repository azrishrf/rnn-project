41|6975|  Chapter: The Last Hour would not come until a person would pass by a grave and wish that he  should have been the occupant of that grave because of this calamity.  Hammam b. Munabbih reported: This is what Abu Huraira reported from Allah’s  messenger (may peace be upon him) and in this connection he reported so many hadith  (and one of them was this): Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Kisra  would die and then there would be no Kisra after him. Qaisar would die and there would  be no Qaisar after him, but you will distribute their treasures in the cause of Allah.

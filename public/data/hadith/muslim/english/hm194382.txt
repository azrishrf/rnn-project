19|4382|  Chapter: Letters of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) to the kings of disbelievers  inviting them to Allah, the Exalted and Glorious.  It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be  upon him) wrote to Chosroes (King of Persia), Caesar (Emperor of Rome), Negus (King  of Abyssinia) and every (other) despot inviting them to Allah, the Exalted. And this  Negus was not the one for whom the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had  said the funeral prayers.

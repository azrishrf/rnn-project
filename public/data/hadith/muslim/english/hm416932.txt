41|6932|  Chapter: The signs before the approach of the Last Hour.  Hudhaifa b. Usaid reported: Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) was in an  apartment and we were beneath that that he peeped in and said to us: What are you  discussing about? We said: (We are discussing about the Last) Hour. Thereupon he  said: The Last Hour would not come until the ten signs appear: land-sliding in the east,  and land-sliding in the west, and land-sliding in the peninsula of Arabia, the smoke, the  Dajjal, the beast of the earth, Gog and Magog, the rising of the sun from the west and  the fire which would emit from the lower part of ‘Adan. Shu’ba said that ‘Abd al-‘Aziz b.         Rufai’ reported on the authority of Abu Tufail who reported on the authority of Abu  Sariha a hadith like this that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) did not make a  mention of (the tenth sign) but he said that out of the ten one was the descent of Jesus  Christ, son of Mary (peace be upon him), and in another version it is them lowing of the  violent gale which would drive the people to the ocean.

26|5498|  Chapter: Plague, ill omen and magic.  Usama b. Zaid reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said this:  This calamity or illness was a punishment with which were punished some of the  nations before you. Then it was left upon the earth. It goes away once and comes back  again. He who heard of its presence in a land should not go towards it, and he who  happened to be in a land where it had broken out should not fly from it.

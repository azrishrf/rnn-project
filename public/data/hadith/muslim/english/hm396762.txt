39|6762|  Chapter: None would attain salvation because of his deeds but it is through Lord’s Mercy (that  he would attain that).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is  none amongst you whose deeds alone would attain salvation for him. They (the  Companions) said: Allah’s Messenger, not even you? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Not  even I, but that Allah wraps me in Mercy and He grants me pardon. Ibn ‘Aun pointed  towards his head with his hand saying: Not even I, but that Allah wraps me in His  Forgiveness and Mercy.  PARADISE AND HELL

22|4819|  Chapter: The proper time for sacrifice.  Jundab b. Sufyan reported: I was with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (on  the occasion) of ‘Id al-Adha. After he had completed the prayer with people, he found  that the goats had been slaughtered, whereupon he said: He who slaughtered sacrificial  animal before the prayer should slaughter a goat (again) in its stead and he who has not  slaughtered he should slaughter it by reciting the name of Allah.

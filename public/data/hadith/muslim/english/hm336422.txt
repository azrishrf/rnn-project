33|6422|  Chapter: The measure of the son of Adam in regard to adultery, etc.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying. Allah  fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in. There would be no escape  from it. The adultery of the eye is the lustful look and the adultery of the ears is listening  to voluptuous (song or talk) and the adultery of the tongue is licentious speech and the  adultery of the hand is the lustful grip (embrace) and the adultery of the feet is to walk  (to the place) where he intends to commit adultery and the heart yearns and desires  which he may or may not put into effect.

19|4355|  Chapter: The saying of the Prophet (may peace be upon him): “We (Prophets) do not  have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity”.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: My heirs cannot share even a dinar (from my legacy) ; what I  leave behind after paving maintenance allowance to my wives and remuneration to my  manager is (to go in) charity.

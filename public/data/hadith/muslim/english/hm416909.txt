41|6909|  Chapter: The events foretold by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) about the last hour.  Hudhaifa reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood before us  one day and he did not leave anything unsaid (that he had to say) at that very spot  which would happen (in the shape of turmoil) up to the Last Hour. Those who had to  remember them preserved them in their minds and those who could not remember them  forgot them. My friends knew them and there are certain things which slip out of my  mind, but I recapitulate them when anyone makes a mention of them just as a person is  lost from one’s mind but is recalled to him on seeing his face.

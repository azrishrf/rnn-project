Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade  (the preparation) of Nabidh in green pitcher, in varnished jar, in hollow stump, and when  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not find anything to prepare Nabidh in  that (i.e. water-skin), it was prepared for him in a big bowl made of stone.

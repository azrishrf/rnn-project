1|289|  Chapter: The descent of Jesus son of Mary, and he will judge according to the Shariâ€™ah  of our Apostle, Muhammad(may peace be upon him).  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger or Allah (may peace be  upon him) observed: I swear by Allah that the son of Mary will certainly descend as a  just judge and he would definitely break the cross, and kill swine and abolish Jizya and  would leave the young she-camel and no one would endeavour to (collect Zakat on it).  Spite, mutual hatred and jealousy against one another will certainly disappear and when  he summons people to accept wealth, not even one would do so.

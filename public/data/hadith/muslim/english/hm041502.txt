4|1502|  Chapter: Praying in houses when it rains.  Sa’id b. Yasar reported: I was travelling along with Ibn ‘Umar on the way to Mecca.  Sa’id said: When I apprehended dawn, I dismounted (the ride) and observed Witr prayer  and then again joined him. Ibn ‘Umar said to me: Where were you? I said: I  apprehended the appearance of dawn, so I dismounted and observed Witr prayer. Upon  this ‘Abdullah said: Is there not a model pattern for you in the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him)? I said: Yes, by Allah, and (then) he said: The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) used to observe Witr prayer on the camel’s back.

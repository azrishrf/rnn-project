Bashir reported that his father brought him to Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) and said: I have donated this slave of mine to my son. Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) said: Have you donated to every one of your sons (a slave)  like this? He said: No. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon him) said:  Then take him back.

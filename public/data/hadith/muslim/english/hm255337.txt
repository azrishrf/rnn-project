25|5337|  Chapter: Excellence of changing ugly names to good names.  Muhammad b. ‘Amr b. ‘Ata’ reported: I had given the name Barra to my daughter.  Zainab, daughter of Abu Salama, told me that Allah’s’ Messenger (may peace be upon         him) had forbidden me to give this name. (She said): I was also called Barra, but Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Don’t hold yourself to be pious. It is God  alone who knows the people of piety among you. They (the Companions) said: Then,  what name should we give to her? He said: Name her as Zainab.

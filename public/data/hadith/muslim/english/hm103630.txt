10|3630|  Chapter: It is forbidden for the townsman to sell on behalf of the man of the desert.  Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  as saying: The townsman should not sell for a man from the desert, leave the people         alone, Allah will give them provision from one another. Yahya reported it with a slight  change of words.

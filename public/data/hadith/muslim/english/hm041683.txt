4|1683|  Chapter: Encouragement to observe prayers during Ramadhan and that is Tarawih.  Ibn Abbas reported: I spent a night in the house of my mother’s sister Maimuna. The  Apostle of Allah (way peace be upon him) got up for observing voluntary prayer  (Tahajjud) at night. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood by the water- skin and performed ablution and then stood up and prayed. I also got up when I saw  him doing that. I also performed ablution from the water-skin and then stood at his left  side. He took hold of my hand from behind his back and then turned me from his back  to his right side. I (‘Ata’, one of the narrators) said: Did it concern the voluntary prayer  (at night)? He (‘Ibn ‘Abbas) said: Yes.

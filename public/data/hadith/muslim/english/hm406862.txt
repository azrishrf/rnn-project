40|6862|  Chapter: The dead would be shown his seat in Paradise and hell, and the affirmation of the  torment of the grave and seeking refuge from it.  Anas b. Malik reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) having said: When the  servant is placed in his grave and his companions retrace their steps arid he hears the  noise of the footsteps, then two angels come to him and make him sit and say to him:  What you have to say about this person (the Holy Prophet)? If he is d believer, lie would  say: I bear testimony to the fact that he is a servant of Allah and His Messenger. Then it  would be said to him: Look to your seat in the Hell Fire, for Allah has substituted (the  seat of yours) with a seat in Paradise. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  said: He would be shown both the seats. Qatada said: It was mentioned to us that his  grave (the grave of a believer) expands to seventy cubits and is full with verdure until  the Day when they would be resurrected.             INTIMATES

31|6045|  Chapter: The merits of Julaibib (Allah be pleased Pith him).  Abu Barza reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) was there in a  battlefield that Allah conferred upon him the spoils of war. He said to his Companions: Is         anyone missing amongst you? They said: So and so and so. He again said: Is there  anyone missing amongst you? They said: So and so and so. He then said: Is there  anyone missing amongst you? They said: No. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said:  But I am missing Julaibib. They (his Companions) searched him amongst those who  had been killed and they found him by the side of seven (dead bodies) whom he had  killed and he had been killed (by the opponents). Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) came there and stood (by his side) and said: He killed seven (persons). Then (his  opponents) killed him. He is mine and I am his. He then placed him upon his hands and  there was none else to lift but Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him). Then the grave  was dug for him and he was placed in the grave and no mention is made of a bath.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

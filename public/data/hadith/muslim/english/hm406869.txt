40|6869|  Chapter: The dead would be shown his seat in Paradise and hell, and the affirmation of the  torment of the grave and seeking refuge from it.  Anas b. Malik reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) let the dead  bodies of the unbelievers who fought in Badr (lie unburied) for three days. He then  came to them and sat by their side and called them and said: O Abu Jahl b. Hisham, O  Umayya b. Khalaf, O Utba b. Rab’ila, O Shaiba b. Rabi’a, have you not found what your  Lord had promised with you to be correct? As for me, I have found the promises of my  Lord to be (perfectly) correct. Umar listened to the words of Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him) and said: Allah’s Messenger, how do they listen and respond to you?  They are dead and their bodies have decayed. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said:  By Him in Whose Hand is my life, what I am saying to them, even you cannot hear more  distinctly than they, but they lack the power to reply. Then he commanded that they  should be buried in the well of Badr.  INTIMATES

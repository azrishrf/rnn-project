4|1451|  Chapter: The excellence of Qunut in all the prayers when any calamity befalls the Muslims.  ‘Imran b. Husain reported: I was with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) in a  journey. We travelled the whole of the night, and when it was about to dawn, we got  down for rest, and were overpowered (by sleep) till the sun shone. Abu Bakr was the  first to awake amongst us and we did not awake the Apostle of Allah (may peace be  upon him) from his sleep allowing him to wake up (of his own accord). It was ‘Umar who  then woke up. He stood by the side of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  and recited takbir in a loud voice till the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  woke up. When he lifted his head, he saw that the sun had arisen; he then said:  Proceed on. He travelled along with us till the sun shone brightly. He came down (from  his camel) and led us in the morning prayer. A person, however, remained away from  the people and did not say, prayer along with us. After having completed the prayer, the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to him: O, so and so, what prevented  you from observing prayer with us? He said: Apostle of Allah! I was not in a state of  purity. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ordered him arid lie performed  Tayammum with dust and said prayer. He then urged me to go ahead immediately  along with other riders to find out water, for we felt very thirsty. We were travelling when  we came across a woman who was sitting (on a camel) with her feet hanging over two  leathern water bags. We said to her: How far is water available? She, said: Far, very far,  very far. You cannot get water. We (again) said: How much distance is there between  (the residence of) your family and water? She said: It is a day and night journey. We  said to her: You go to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: Who  is the Messenger of Allah? We somehow or the other managed to bring her to the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he asked about her, and she  informed him as she had informed us that she was a widow having orphan children. He  ordered that her camel should be made to kneel down and he gargled in the opening (of  her leathern water-bag). The camel was then raised up and we forty thirsty men drank  water till we were completely satiated, and we filled up all leathern water-bags and  water-skins that we had with us and we washed our companions, but we did not make  any camel drink, and (the leathern water-bags) were about to burst (on account of         excess of water). He then said: Bring whatever you have with you. So we collected the  bits (of eatable things) and dates and packed them up in a bundle, and said to her: Take  it away. This is meant for your children, and know that we have not itâ€™s any way  done any loss to your water. When she came to her family she said: I have met the  greatest magician amongst human beings, or he is an apostle, as he claims to be, and  she then narrated what had happened and Allah guided aright those people through  that woman. She affirmed her faith in Islam and so did the people embrace Islam.

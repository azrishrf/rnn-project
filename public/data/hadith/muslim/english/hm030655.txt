Jahsh who was the sister-in-law of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) and the wife of ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, remained mustahada for seven years,  and she, therefore, asked for the verdict of Shari’ah from the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) about it The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  This is not menstruation, but (blood from) a vein: so bathe yourself and offer prayer.  ‘Aisha said: She took a bath in the wash-tub placed in the apartment of her sister  Zainab b. Jahsh, till the redness of the blood came over the water. Ibn Shihab said: I  narrated it to Abu Bakr b. ‘Abd al-Rahman b. al-Harith b. Hisham about it who observed:  May Allah have mercy on Hinda! would that she listened to this verdict. By Lord, she  wept for not offering prayer.

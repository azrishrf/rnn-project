10|3613|  Chapter: Prohibition of Bail Mulamasa and Bai’Munabaza.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) forbade us (from),two types of business transactions and two ways  of dressing. He forbade Mulamasa and Munabadha in transactions. Mulamasa means  the touching of another’s garment with his hand, whether at night or by day, without  turning it over except this much. Munabadha means that a man throws his garment to  another and the other throws his garment, and thus confirming their contract without the  inspection of mutual agreement. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn  Shihab through the same chain of transmitters.

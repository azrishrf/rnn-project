32|6309|  Chapter: The evil of a lie and the goodness of truth and its merit.  ‘Abdullah reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: It is  obligatory for you to tell the truth, for truth leads to virtue and virtue leads to Paradise,  and the man who continues to speak the truth and endeavours to tell the truth is  eventually recorded as truthful with Allah, and beware of telling of a lie for telling of a lie  leads to obscenity and obscenity leads to Hell-Fire, and the person who keeps telling  lies and endeavours to tell a lie is recorded as a liar with Allah.

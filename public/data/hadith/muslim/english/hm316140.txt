31|6140|  Chapter: Concerning the merits of the women of the Quraish.  Abu Huraira reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave a proposal  of marriage to Umm Hani, the daughter of Abu Talib, whereupon she said: Allah’s  Messenger, I am of an advanced age with a (large) family. Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The best women are those who ride (the  camels); the rest of the hadith is the same but with this difference that, instead of the  word Ar’a the word Ahna has been used (and the complete sentence is like this): That  they treat children in their childhood with affection.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

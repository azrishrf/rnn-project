21|4795|  Chapter: Pertaining to the flesh of the Lizard.  Sa’id b. Jubair reported that he heard Ibn ‘Abbas says: The sister of my mother Umm  Hufaid presented to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) clarified butter (ghee),  cheese and some lizards. He ate out of the clarified butter and cheese, but let the lizard  finding no liking for it. But it was eaten on the table of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him). Had it been forbidden (haram), it could not be eaten on the table of Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him).

1|407|  Chapter: Regarding the words of Allah: “And warn thy nearest kindred”.  This hadith was narrated by A’mash on the authority of the same chain of narrators and  he said: One day the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) climbed the hill of  Safa’ and said: Be on your guard, and the rest of the hadith was narrated like the hadith  transmitted by Usama; he made no mention of the revelation of the verse: “Warn thy  nearest kindred.”

43|7182|  Chapter: Pertaining to the Words of Allah: “Those whom they call upon, themselves  seek the means of access to their Lord” (xvii. 57).  Abdullah b. Mas’ud reported in connection with the words of Allah, the Exalted and  Glorious: “Those to whom they call upon, themselves seek the means or access to their  Lord as to whoever of them becomes nearest” (xvii. 57) that it related to a party of Jinn  who were being worshipped and they embraced Islam but those who worshipped them  kept on worshipping them (though the Jinn whom the misguided people worshipped had  become Muslims). It was then that this verse was revealed.

10|3709|  Chapter: Forbiddance of al-Mubiqala, and al-Muzabana, and al-Mukhabara and the  sale of fruits before their good condition is clear, and al-Mu’awama, i.e., the sale for  some years.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) forbade Mukhabara and Muhaqala, and Muzabana, and the sale of  the fruit until it is fit for eating, and its sale but with dirham and dinar. Exception is made         in case of ‘araya. Ata’ said: Jabir explained (these terms) for us. As for Mukhabara it is  this that a wasteland is given by a person to another and he makes an investment in it  and then gets a share in the produce. According to him (Jabir), Muzabana is the smell  of fresh dates on the tree for dry dates with a measure, and Muhaqala in agriculture  implies that one should sell the standing crop for grains with a measure.

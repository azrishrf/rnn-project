8|3315|  Chapter: It is permissible to caste a glance at the face and the palms of a woman who one  intends to marry.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to Allah’s Messenger  (May peace be upon him) and said: I have contracted marriage with a woman of the  Ansar, whereupon Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) said: Did you cast a glance  at her, for there is something in the eyes of the Ansar? He said: I did cast a glance at  her, whereupon he said: For what (dower) did you marry her? He said: For four ‘uqiyas.  Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) said: For four ‘uqiyas; it seems as  if you dig out silver from the side of this mountain (and that is why you are prepared to  pay such a large amount of dower). We have nothing which we should give you. There  is a possibility that we may send you to an (expedition) where you may get (booty). So  he sent that man (in the expedition) which was despatched to Banu ‘Abs.

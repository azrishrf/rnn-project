30|5794|  Chapter: The qualities of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and age when he was given  the ministry of apostlehood and the duration of his life.  Anas b. Malik reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was neither  very conspicuously tall nor short-statured, and his colour was neither glaringly white nor  brown; his hair was neither very curly nor very straight; Allah commissioned him (as a  Prophet) when he had reached the age of forty years, and he stayed in Mecca for ten  years and for ten years in Medina; Allah took him away when he had just reached the  age of sixty, and there had not been twenty white hair in his head and beard.

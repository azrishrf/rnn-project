Abdullah reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  exhorting people on the Day of the Battle of the Ditch to fight. Zubair said: I am ready (to  participate). He then again exhorted and he again said: I am ready to participate.  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Behold. for every Prophet  there is a helper and my helper is Zubair.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

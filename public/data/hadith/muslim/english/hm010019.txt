1|19|  Chapter: Concerning the saying of the Apostle; Islam is founded on five  (fundamentals).         It is narrated on the authority of (‘Abdullah) son of ‘Umar, that the Holy Prophet (may  peace of Allah be upon him) said: (The superstructure of) al-Islam is raised on five  (pillars), i.e. Allah (alone) should be worshipped, and (all other gods) beside Him should  be (categorically) denied. Establishment of prayer, the payment of Zakat, Pilgrimage to  the House, and the fast of Ramadan (are the other obligatory acts besides the belief in  the oneness of Allah and denial of all other gods).

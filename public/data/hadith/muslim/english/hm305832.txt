30|5832|  Chapter: It is obligatory to follow the Prophet (may peace be upon him) in all matters pertaining  to religion, but one is free to act on one’s own opinion in matters which pertain to technical skill.  Anas reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened to pass by  the people who had been busy in grafting the trees. Thereupon he said: If you were not  to do it, it might be good for you. (So they abandoned this practice) and there was a  decline in the yield. He (the Holy Prophet) happened to pass by them (and said): What  has gone wrong with your trees? They said: You said so and so. Thereupon he said:  You have better knowledge (of a technical skill) in the affairs of the world.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

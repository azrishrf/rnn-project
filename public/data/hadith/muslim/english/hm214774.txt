21|4774|  Chapter: The eating of the flesh of domestic asses is unlawful.  Ibn ‘Abbas reported: I do not know whether Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) prohibited (the eating of the domestic ass) due to the fact that they were the beasts  of burden for the people, so he (the Holy Prophet) did not like their beasts of burden to  be destroyed (as a matter of expediency), or he prohibited the use of the flesh of  domestic asses (not as an expediency but as a law of the Shari’ah) on the Day of  Khaibar.

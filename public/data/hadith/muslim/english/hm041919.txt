4|1919|  Chapter: What is to be recited in the Jumu’a prayer ?.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar, while describing the Nafl prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him), said: He did not observe (Nafl) prayer after Jumu’a till he went  back and observed two rak’ahs in his house. Yahya said: I guess that I uttered these  words (before Imam Malik) that he of course observed (them).

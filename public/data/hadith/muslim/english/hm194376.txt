19|4376|  Chapter: Return of their gifts to the Ansar by the Muhajirs when the latter grew rich as a  result of the conquests.  It has been narrated by Anas that (after his migration to Medina) a person placed at the  Prophetâ€™s (may peace be upon him) disposal some date-palms growing on his land until  the lands of Quraiza and Nadir were conquered. Then he began to return to him  whatever he had received. (In this connection) my people told me to approach the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and ask from him what his people had  given him or a portion thereof, but the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  had bestowed those trees upon Umm Aiman. So I came to the Prophet (may peace be  upon him) and he gave hem (back) to me. Umm Aiman (also) came (at this time). She  put the cloth round my neck and said: No, by Allah, we will not give to, you what he has  granted to me. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Umm Aiman, let him  have them and for you are such and such trees instead. But she said: By Allah, there is  no god besides Him. No, never ! The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) continued  saying: (You will get) such and such, until he had granted her ten times or nearly ten  times more (than the original gift).

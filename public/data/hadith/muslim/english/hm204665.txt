20|4665|  Chapter: The merit of helping the warrior (fighting in the way of Allah) with something to  ride upon and looking after his family in his absence.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Masâ€™ud al-Ansari who said: A man came to  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: My riding beast has been  killed, so give me some animal to ride upon. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have none  with me. A man said: Messenger of Allah, I can guide him to one who will provide him  with a riding beast. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: One who  guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer.

20|4721|  Chapter: Saying of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him): “A group of people from  my Umma will always remain on the right path and continue to be triumphant.’ their  opponents shall not be able to do them any harm.  It has been narrated on the authority of ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Shamasa al-Mahri who said:  I was in the company of Maslama b. Mukhallad, and ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr b. ‘As was with  him. ‘Abdullah said: The Hour shall some only when the worst type of people are left on  the earth. They will be worse than the people of pre-Islamic days. They will get  whatever they ask of Allah. While we were yet sitting when ‘Uqba b. ‘Amir came, and  Maslama said to him: ‘Uqba, listen to what ‘Abdullah says. ‘Uqba said: He knows better;  so far as I am concerned, I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say:  A group of people from my Umma will continue to fight in obedience to the Command of  Allah, remaining dominant over their enemies. Those who will oppose them shall not do  them any harm. They will remain ill this condition until the Hour overtakes them. (At this)  ‘Abdullah said: Yes. Then Allah will raise a wild which will be fragrant like musk and  whose touch will be like the touch of silk ; (but) it will cause the death of all (faithful)  persons, not leaving behind a single person with an iota of faith in his heart. Then only  the worst of men will remain to be overwhelmed by the Hour.

32|6293|  Chapter: He upon whom Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) invoked curse  whereas he in fact did not deserve it, it would be a source of reward and mercy for him.  Salim, the freed slave of Nasriyyin, said: I heard Abu Huraira as saying that he heard  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: O Allah, Muhammad is a  human being. I lose my temper just as human beings lose temper, and I have held a  covenant with Thee which Thou wouldst not break: For a believer whom I give any  trouble or invoke curse or beat, make that an expiation (of his sins and a source of) his  nearness to Thee on the Day of Resurrection.

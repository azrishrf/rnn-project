7|3143|  Chapter: The sacred territory of Mecca and its inviolability and the prohibition to do  hunting in it and its suburbs and felling down of its trees and cutting its grass.  Abu Huraira(Allah be pleased with him)reported: The people of the Khuza’ah tribe killed  a man of the tribe of Laith in the Year of Victory as a retaliation for one whom they had  killed (whom the people of the tribe of Laith had killed). It was reported to Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him). He mounted his camel and delivered this  address: Verily Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, held back the Elephants from Mecca,  and gave its domination to His Messenger and believers. Behold, it was not violable for  anyone before me and it will not be violable for anyone after me. Behold, it was made  violable for me for an hour of a day; and at this very hour it has again been made  inviolable (for me as well as for others). So its thorns are not to be cut, its trees are not  to be lopped, and (no one is allowed to) pick up a thing dropped, but the one who  makes an announcement of it. And one whose fellow is killed is allowed to opt between  two alternatives: either he should receive blood-money or get the life of the (murderer)  in return. He (the narrator said): A person from the Yemen, who was called Abu Shah,  came to him and said: Messenger of Allah, write it down for me, whereupon he (Allah’s  Messenger) said: Write it down for Abu Shah. One of the persons from among the  Quraish also said: Except Idhkhir, for we use it in our houses ant our graves. Thereupon  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Except Idhkhir.

7|2832|  Chapter: Sacrificing of animal Is obligatory for Tamattul, but he who does not do it is  required to observe fast for three days during the Hajj and for seven days when he  returns to the family.  Abdullah b. ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported: Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) observed Tamattu’ in Hajjat-ul-Wada’. He first put on Ihram for  ‘Umra and then for Hajj and then offered animal sacrifice. So he drove the sacrificial  animals with him from Dhu’l-Hulaifa. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  commenced Ihram of Umra and thus pronounced Talbiya for ‘Umra and then (put on  Ihram for Hajj) and pronounced Talbiya for Hajj. And the people performed Tamattu’ in  the company of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). They put on Ihram for  Umra (first) and then for Hajj. Some of them had sacrificial animals which they had  brought with them, whereas some of them had none to sacrifice. So when Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Mecca, he said to the people: He who  amongst you has brought sacrificial animals along with him must not treat as lawful  anything which has become unlawful for him till he has completed the Hajj; and he, who  amongst you has not brought the sacrificial animals should circumambulate the House,  and run between al-Safa’ and al-Marwa and clip (his hair) and put off the Ihram, and  then again put on the Ihram for Hajj and offer sacrifice of animals. But he who does not  find the sacrificial animal, he should observe fast for three days during the Hajj and for  seven days when he returns to his family. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  circumambulated (the House) when he came to Mecca: he first kissed the corner (of the  Ka’ba containing the Black Stone), then ran in three circuits out of seven and walked in  four circuits. And then when he had finished the circumambulation of the House he  observed two rak’ahs of prayer at the Station (of Ibrahim), and then pronounced Salaam  (for concluding the rak’ahs), and departed and came to al-Safa’ and ran seven times  between al-Safa’ and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had  become unlawful till he had completed his Hajj and sacrificed his animal on the day of  sacrifice (10th of Dhu’l-Hijja) and then went back quickly (to Mecca) and performed  circumambulation of the House (known as tawaf ifada) after which all that was unlawful  for him became lawful; and those who had brought the sacrificial animals along with  them did as Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done. This Hadith has  been narrated on the authority of ‘Aisha. The wife of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be         upon him), concerning his Tamattu’ of Hajj and ‘Umra and performing of Tamattu’ by  people in his company.

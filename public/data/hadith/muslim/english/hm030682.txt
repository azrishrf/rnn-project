3|682|  Chapter: Abrogation of (the command that) bath is obligatory(only) because of seminal  emission and instead contact of the circumcised parts makes bath obligatory.  Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When a man  has sexual intercourse, bathing becomes obligatory (both for the male and the female).  In the Hadith of Matar the words are: Even if there is no orgasm. Zuhair has narrated it  with a minor alteration of words.

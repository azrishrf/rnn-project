4|1603|  Chapter: Permissibility of observing Nafl (voluntary prayer) standing or sitting and observing  some part of it standing or sitting.  ‘Aisha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), said that between the  time when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) finished the ‘Isha prayer         which is called ‘Atama by the people, he used to pray eleven rak’ahs, uttering the  salutation at the end of every two rak’ahs, and observing the Witr with a single one. And  when the Mu’adhdhin had finished the call (for the) dawn prayer and he saw the dawn  clearly and the Mu’adhdhin had come to him, he stood up and prayed two short rak’ahs.  Then he lay down on his right side till the Mu’adhdhin came to him for Iqama. (This  Hadith has been narrated with the same chain of transmitters by Ibn Shihab, but in it no  mention has been made of Iqama )

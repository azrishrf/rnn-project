10|3651|  Chapter: It is invalid to sell the commodity before taking possession of it.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: He who bought food-grain should not sell it until he had measured  it. In the narration of Abu Bakr there the word is Ibta’ instead of Ishtara.

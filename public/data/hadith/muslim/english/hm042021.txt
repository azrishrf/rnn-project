4|2021|  Chapter: The dead body is punished for the lamentation of his family.  Anas reported that when ‘Umar b. Khattab was wounded Hafsa lamented for him. Upon  this he said: O Hafsa, did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) saying: “One who is lamented would be punished”? Suhaib also lamented over  him. ‘Umar told him also: O Suhaib, didn’t you know that one who is lamented is  punished?

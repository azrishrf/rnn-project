1|44|  Chapter: He who meets his Lord with implicit faith would enter Heaven and fire would  be forbidden to harm him.  It is narrated on the authority of Umar b. Hani with the same chain of transmitters with  the exception of these words: Allah would make him (he who affirms these truths) enter  Paradise through one of the eight doors which he would like.

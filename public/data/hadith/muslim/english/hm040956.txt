4|956|  Chapter: The duty of the Imam is to be brief and perfect in prayer.  Thabit reported it on the authority of Anas: While leading you in prayer I do not shorten  anything in the prayer. I pray as I saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  leading us. He (Thabit) said: Anas used to do that which I do not see you doing; when  he lifted his head from bowing he stood up (so long) that one would say: He has  forgotten (to bow down in prostration). And when he lifted his head from prostration, he  stayed in that position, till someone would say: He has forgotten (to bow down in  prostration for the second sajda).

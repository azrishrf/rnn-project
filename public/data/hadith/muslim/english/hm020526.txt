2|526|  Chapter: Wiping over the socks.  Mughira b. Shuâ€™ba reported: I was with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) one night. He came down (from the ride) and relieved himself. He then came and I  poured water upon him from the jar that I carried with me. He performed ablution and  wiped over his socks.

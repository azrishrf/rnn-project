7|3036|  Chapter: It is meritorious for one who does intend to go himself to send the sacrificial  animal to al-Haram.  ‘Aisha reported: I wove the garlands for the sacrificial animals of Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) with my own bands, and then he (the Holy Prophet) marked  them, and garlanded them, and then sent them to the House, and stayed at Medina and  nothing was forbidden to him which was lawful for him (before).

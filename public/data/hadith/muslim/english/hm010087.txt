1|87|  Chapter: Precedence of the believers over one another and the superiority of the  people of Yemen in this respect.         It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  and blessings be upon him) remarked: The summit of unbelief is towards the East and  the pride and conceitedness is found among the owners of horses and camels who are  rude and uncivil, people of the tents, and tranquillity is found among those who rear  goats and sheep.

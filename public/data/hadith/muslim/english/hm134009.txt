13|4009|  Chapter: He who has not anything with him to will away should not do it.  Talha b. Musarrif reported: I asked ‘Abdullah b. Abu Aufa whether Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) had made any will (in regard to his property). He said: No. I  said: Then why has making of will been made necessary for the Muslims, or why were  they commanded to make will? Thereupon he said: He made the will according to the  Book of Allah, the Exalted and Majestic.

41|7013|  Chapter: Account of the Dajjal and his features and what would be along with.  Hudhaifa and Ibn Masâ€™ud met together. Hudhaifa said: I know more than you as to what  there would be along with the Dajjal. There would be along with him two canals (one  flowing with water) and the other one (having) fire (within it), and what you would see as  fire would be water and what you would see as water would be fire. So he who amongst  you is able to see that and is desirous of water should drink out of that which he sees as  fire.

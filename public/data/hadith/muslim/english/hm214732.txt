21|4732|  Chapter: Hunting with the help of trained dogs.  ‘Adi b. Hatim reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, I set off trained dogs and they catch  for me (the game) and I recite the came of Allah over it (I slaughter the game by reciting  Bismillah-i-Allah-o-Akbar), whereupon he said: When you set off your trained dogs and  you recited the name of Allah (while setting them off), then eat (the game). I said: Even  if them (the trained dogs) kill that (the game)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Even if these  kill, but (on the condition) that no other dog, which you did not set off (along with your  dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I throw Mi’rad, a heavy  featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game). Thereupon he said: When  you throw Mi’rad, and it pierces, then eat, but if it falls flatly (and beats the game to  death), then do not eat that.

4|1962|  Chapter: (Prayer for) protection (of Allah) when there is a windstorm. or (terribly dark)  cloud, and feeling joy when there is a rainfall.  ‘Ata’ b. Rabah reported on the authority of ‘Aisha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (way  peace be upon him), who said: Whenever the wind was stormy, the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him) used to say: O Allah ! I ask Thee for what is good in it, and  the good which it contains, and the good of that which it was sent for. I seek refuge with  Thee from what is evil in it, what evil it contains, and the evil of that what it was sent for;  and when there was a thunder and lightning in the sky, his colour underwent a change,  and he went out and in, backwards and forwards; and when the rain came, he felt  relieved, and I noticed that (the sign of relief) on his face. ‘Aisha asked him (about it)  and he said: It may be as the people of ‘Ad said: When they saw a cloud formation  coming to their valley they said: “It is a cloud which would give us rain” (Qur’an, xlvi. 24).

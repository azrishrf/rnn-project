7|2900|  Chapter: Excellence of walking at a quick pace in Tawaf and Umra and on the occasion  of first Tawaf in Hajj.  Abu Tufail reported: I said to Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them): Do you think that  walking swiftly round the House in three circuits, and just walking in four circuits is the  Sunnah (of the Holy Prophet), for your people say that it is Sunnah? Thereupon he (Ibn  ‘Abbas) said: They have told the truth and the lie (too). I said: What do your words  “They have told the truth and the lie (too)” imply? Thereupon he said: Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) came to Mecca and the polytheists said that Muhammad and  his Companions had emaciated and would, therefore, be unable to circumambulate the  House; and they felt jealous of him (the Holy Prophet). (It was due to this) that Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded them to walk swiftly in three (circuits)  and walk (normally) in four. I said to him: Inform me if it is Sunnah to observe Tawaf  between al-Safa and al-Marwa while riding, for your people look upon it as Sunnah. He  (Ibn Abbas) said: They have told the truth and the lie too. I said: What do your words  “They have told the truth and the lie tool, imply? He said: as Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) had come to Mecca, there was such a large gathering of people  around him that even the virgins had come out of their houses (to catch a glimpse of his  face) and they were saying: He is Muhammad; He is Muhammad, Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) (was so gentle and kind) that the people were not beaten  back (to make way) in front of him. When there was a; throng (of people) around him,  he rode (the she-camel) but walking and trotting is, however, better.

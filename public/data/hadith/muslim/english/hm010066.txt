1|66|  Chapter: Concerning the eminence of Islam and of the affairs which are excellent.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Musa Ash’ari: I asked the Messenger of Allah  which (attribute) of Islam is more excellent. Upon this he remarked: One in which the  Muslims are safe, protected from the tongue and hand of (other Muslims). Ibrahim b.  Sa’id al-Jauhari has narrated this hadith with the same words in addition to these. The  Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) was asked as to who  amongst the Muslims is better, and the rest of the hadith was narrated like this.

4|1860|  Chapter: There is a special (fortunate) time on Friday.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: We are  the last (but) we would be the first on the Day of Resurrection, and we would be the first  to enter Paradise, but that they were given the Book before us and we were given after  them. They disagreed and Allah guided us aright on whatever they disagreed regarding  the truth. And it was this day of theirs about which they disagreed, but Allah guided us  to it, and that is Friday for us; the next day is for the Jews and the day following for the  Christians.

20|4489|  Chapter: Prohibition of desire for a position of authority and covetousness thereof.  It has been narrated by Abu Musa who said: Two of my cousins and I entered the  apartment of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). One of them said: Messenger  of Allah, appoint us rulers of some lands that the Almighty and Glorious God has  entrusted to thy care. The other also said something similar. He said: We do not appoint  to this position one who asks for it nor anyone who is covetous for the same.

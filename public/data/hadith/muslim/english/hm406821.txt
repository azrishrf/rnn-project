40|6821|  Chapter: The haughty and the proud would Set into the fire of hell and the humble and meek  would get into Paradise.  Hammam b. Munabbih reported that Abu Huraira narrated to them some ahadith of  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and one of them is this that Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The Paradise and the Hell fell into dispute  and the Hell said: I have been distinguished for accommodating (the haughty and proud  in me), and the Paradise said: What is the matter that the meek and the humble and the  downtrodden and simple would find an abode in me? Thereupon Allah said to Paradise:  You are a (means) of My Mercy. I shall show mercy through you to one whom I will from  amongst My servants. And Allah said to the Hell: You are a (sign) of My chastisement  and I shall chastise through you anyone whom I will from amongst My servants and  both of you, would be full. And as regards the Hell it would not be full until Allah, the  Exalted and Glorious, places His foot therein, and it would say: Enough, enough,  enough, and it would be then full and the one part would draw very close to the other  one and Allah would not treat unjustly anyone amongst His creation and He would  create another creation for the Paradise (to accommodate it).

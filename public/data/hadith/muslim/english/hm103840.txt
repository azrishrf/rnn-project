10|3840|  Chapter: The sale of gold necklace studded with pearls.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) as saying in the Year of Victory while he was in Mecca: Verily Allah and  His Messenger have forbidden the sale of wine, carcass, swine and idols, It was said:  Allah’s Messenger, you see that the fat of the carcass is used for coating the boats and  varnishing the hides and people use it for lighting purposes, whereupon he said: No, it is  forbidden, Then Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah the  Exalted and Majestic destroy the Jews; when Allah forbade the use of fat of the carcass  for them, they melted it, and then sold it and made use of its price (received from it).

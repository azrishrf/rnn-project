22|4830|  Chapter: The proper time for sacrifice.  Al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) addressed us  on the day of Nahr and said: None should sacrifice the animal unless he has completed  the (‘Id) prayer. A person said: I have a milch goat of less than one year, better than two  fat goats. Thereupon he said: Sacrifice it, and no goat of less than a year of age will be  accepted as sacrifice after you.

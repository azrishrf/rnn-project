4|1630|  Chapter: Prayer during the night and the number of the Rak’ahs which the Apostle (may peace  be upon him) observed in the night and observance of one Rak’ah of Witr.  Zaid b. Arqam, on seeing some people praying in the forenoon, said: They well know  that prayer at another time than this is more excellent, for Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: The prayer of those who are penitent is observed when your  weaned camels feel the heat of the sun.

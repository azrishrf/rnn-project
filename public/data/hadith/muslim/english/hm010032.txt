1|32|  Chapter: Command for fighting against the people so long as they do not profess that  there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger.  It is narrated on the authority of Jabir that the Messenger of Allah said: I have been  commanded that I should fight against people till they declare that there is no god but  Allah, and when they profess it that there is no god but Allah, their blood and riches are  guaranteed protection on my behalf except where it is justified by law, and their affairs  rest with Allah, and then he (the Holy Prophet) recited (this verse of the Holy Qur’an):  “Thou art not over them a warden” (lxxxviii, 22).

4|1348|  Chapter: Time for the night prayer and its delay.  Muhammad b. ‘Amr b. al-Hasan b. ‘All reported: When Hajjaj came to Medina we asked  Jabir b. Abdullah (about the timings of prayer as observed by the Holy Prophet). He  said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to pray afternoon prayer  in the midday heat; the afternoon prayer when the sun was bright; the evening prayer  when the sun had completely set; and as for the night prayer, he sometimes delayed  and sometimes (observed it) at earlier hours. When he found them (his Companions)  assembled (at earlier hours) he (prayed) early and when he saw them coming late, he  delayed the (prayer) and the morning prayer the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon  him) observed in the darkness before dawn.

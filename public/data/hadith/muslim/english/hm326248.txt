32|6248|  Chapter: It is forbidden to commit oppression.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Be on  your guard against committing oppression, for oppression is a darkness on the Day of  Resurrection, and be on your guard against pettimindedness for pettimindedness  destroyed those who were before you, as it incited them to shed blood and make lawful  what was unlawful for them.

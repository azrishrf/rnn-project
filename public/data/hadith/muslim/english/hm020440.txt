2|440|  Chapter: The merit of Wudu and that of prayer after it.  Humran reported when ‘Uthman performed ablution he said: By Allah, I am narrating to  you a Hadith had there not been this verse in the Book of Allah. I would not have  narrated it to you. Verily I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say:  Not a person is there who performed ablution, and did it well, then offered prayer, but  his sins (which he committed) were not pardoned between the prayer that he offered  and the next one. ‘Urwa said: The verse is this: “Those who suppress the clear proofs  and the guidance which We have sent down”... to His words: “the Cursers” (ii. 15).

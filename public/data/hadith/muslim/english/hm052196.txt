5|2196|  Chapter: Sadaqa includes all types of good acts.  ‘Aisha said that a person came to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and  said: My mother died suddenly without having made any will. I think she would have  definitely given Sadaqa if she had been able to speak. Would she have a reward if I  gave Sadaqa on her behalf? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. This Hadith has been  narrated on the authority of Hisham with the same chain of transmitters. And in the  Hadith transmitted by Abu Usama the words are: “She did not make any will,” as it has  been reported by Ibn Bishr, but it was not reported by the rest of the narrators.

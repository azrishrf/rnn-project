9|3600|  Chapter: It is forbidden for a slave to take anyone as his ally except one who  emancipates him.         Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) as saying: He who took the freed slave as his ally without the consent of his  previous master, there is upon him the curse of Allah and that of His angels and that of  the whole mankind, and there will not be accepted from him his obligatory acts or  supererogatory acts on the Day of Resurrection. This hadith is narrated through the  same chain of transmitters, but with a slight change of words.

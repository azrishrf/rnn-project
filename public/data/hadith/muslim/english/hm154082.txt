15|4082|  Chapter: How should the masters treat their slaves and expiation if they show high- handedness.         Hilal b. Yasaf reported that a person got angry and slapped his slave-girl. Thereupon  Suwaid b. Muqarrin said to him: You could find no other part (to slap) but the prominent  part of her face. See I was one of the seven sons of Muqarrin, and we had but only one  slave-girl. The youngest of us slapped her, and Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) commanded us to set her free.2097

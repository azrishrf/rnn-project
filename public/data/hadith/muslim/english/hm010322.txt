1|322|  Chapter: Night journey of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) to Heaven  and the prayer made obligatory.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: When I was taken for the night journey I met Moses peace be upon  him). The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave his description thus: He was  a man, I suppose-and he (the narrator) was somewhat doubtful (that the Holy Prophet  observed): (Moses) was a man erect in stature with straight hair on his head as it he  was one of the men of the Shanuâ€™a; and I met Jesus and the Apostle of Allah (may  peace be upon him) described him as one having a medium stature and a red  complexion as if he had (just) come out of the bath He observed: I saw Ibrahim (peace  be upon him) and amongst his children I have the greatest resemblance with him. He  said: There were brought to me two vessels. In one of them was milk and in the other  one there was wine. And it was said to me: Select any one you like. So I selected the  vessel containing milk and drank it. He (the angel) said: You have been guided on al- fitra or you have attained al-fitra. Had you selected wine, your Ummah would have been  misled.

8|3412|  Chapter: It is forbidden to marry the step daughter and the sister of the wife (when the wife is  alive and not divorced).  Umm Habiba, the daughter of AbuSufyan, reported: The Messenger of Allah (May  peace be upon him) came to me and I said to him: Have you any inclination towards me  the daughter of Abu Sufyan? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then what should I do? I said:  Marry her. He said: Do you like that? I said: I am not the exclusive (wife) of yours; I,  therefore, wish to join my sister in good. He said: She is not lawful for me. I said: I have  been informed that you have given the proposal of marriage to Durrah; daughter of Abu  Salama He said: You mean the daughter of Umm Salama? I said: Yes. He said: Even if  she had not been my step-daughter brought up under my guardianship, she would not  have been lawful for me, for she is the daughter of my foster-brother (Hamza), for  Thuwaiba had suckled me and her father. So do not give me the proposal of the  marriage of your daughters and sisters. This hadith has been narrated on the authority  of Hisham with the same chain of transmitters.

1|210|  Chapter: Strict forbiddance of acting unfaithfully in relation to the spoils or booty. The  believers alone would enter Paradise.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira: We went to Khaibar along with the Apostle  (may peace be upon him) and Allah granted us victory. We plundered neither gold nor  silver but laid our hands on goods, corn and clothes, and then bent our stops to a valley;  along with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) there was a slave who was  presented to him by one Rifaâ€™a b. Zaid of the family of Judham, a tribe of Dubayb. When  we got down into the valley the slave of the Messenger of Allah stood up and began to  unpack the saddle-bag and was suddenly struck by a (stray) arrow which proved fatal.  We said: There is a greeting for him, Messenger of Allah, as he is a martyr. Upon this  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: Nay, not so. By Him in  Whose hand is the life of Muhammad, the small garment which he stole from the booty  on the day of Khaibar but which did not (legitimately) fall to his lot is burning like the Fire  (of Hell) on him. The people were greatly perturbed (on hearing this). A person came  there with a lace or two laces and said: Messenger of Allah, I found (them) on the day of  Khaibar. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: This is a lace of fire or two laces of fire.

1|73|  Chapter: Concerning the fact that it is one of the characteristics of Iman that one should  like the same thing for one’s brother-in-Islam as one likes for one’s self.  It is narrated on the authority of Anas that the Prophet (may peace blessings be upon  him) observed: By Him in whose Hand is my life, no, bondsman (truly) believes till he  likes for his neighbour, or he (the Holy Prophet) said: for his brother, whatever he likes  for himself.

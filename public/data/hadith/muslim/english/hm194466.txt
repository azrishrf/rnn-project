19|4466|  Chapter: The number of wars waged by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).         It has been reported on the authority of Abu Zubair who heard Jabir b. Abdullah say: I  fought in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) nineteen  battles. Jabir said: I did not participate in the Battle of Badr and the Battle of Uhud. My  father prevented me (from participating in these battles as my age was tender). After  â€˜Abdullah (my father) was killed on the Day of Uhud, I never lagged behind the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and joined every battle (he fought).

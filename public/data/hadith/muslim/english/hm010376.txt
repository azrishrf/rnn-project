1|376|  Chapter: The lowest of the ranks in Paradise.  Anas b. Malik reported: Verily the Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: He who  professed: There is no god but Allah, would be brought out of the Fire even though he  has in his heart virtue equal to the weight of a barley grain. Then he who professed:  There is no god but Allah, would come out of the Fire, even though he has in his heart  virtue equal to the weight of a wheat grain. He would then bring out from the Fire he  who professed: There is no god but Allah, even though he has in his heart virtue equal  to the weight of an atom. Ibn Minhal has made an addition (of these words) in his  narration: Yazid said: I met Shu’ba and narrated to him this hadith. Shu’ba said: Qatada  transmitted to us this hadith from Anas b. Malik who heard it from the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him) with this alteration that he substituted the word Zurra (grain)  in place of Zarra (atom). Yazid said: Abu Bistam has made a change in it.

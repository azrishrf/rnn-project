5|2336|  Chapter: It is forbidden to pay Zakat to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and  Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib.  Yusair b. ‘Amr reported that he inquired of Sahl b. Hunaif: Did you hear the Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him) making a mention of the Khwarij? He said: I heard him  say (and he pointed with his hand towards the east) that these would be a people who  would recite the Qur’an with their tongues and it would not go beyond their collar bones.  They would pass clean through their religion just as the arrow passes through the prey.

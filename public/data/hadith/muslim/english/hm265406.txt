26|5406|  Chapter: If a person comes to a meeting and finds space there he should sit there, otherwise  he should depart.  Abu Waqid al-Laith reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was  sitting in the mosque along wish tome people when there came to him three persons;  two of them stepped forward to the direction of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him), and one of them went away. The two stood by the side of Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him), and one of them found a space in his circle and he sat in that; and  the other one sat behind him and the third one went away. When Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) had finished his work, he said. Should I not inform you about         these three persons? One of them sought refuge with Allah and Allah gave him refuge  and the second one felt shy and Allah showed kindness to has shyness (and so he was  accommodated in that meeting), and the last one reverted and Allah turned away His  attention from him.

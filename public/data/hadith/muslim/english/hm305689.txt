30|5689|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  Uqba b. ‘Amir reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah’s Messenger  offered  prayer  over  those  who  had  fallen  martyrs  at  Uhud.  He  then  climbed  the  pulpit  as  if  someone is saying good-bye to the living and the dead, and then said: I shall be there as your  predecessor on the Cistern before you, and it is as wide as the distance between Aila and Juhfa  (Aila is at the top of the gulf of ‘Aqaba). I am not afraid that you would associate anything with  Allah after me, but I am afraid that you may be (allured) by the world and (vie) with one another  (in  possessing  material  wealth)  and  begin  killing  one  another,  and  you  would  be  destroyed  as  were destroyed those who had gone before you. ‘Uqba said that that was the last occasion that  he saw Allah’s Messenger on the pulpit.

10|3918|  Chapter: Unknown.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: None among you should prevent his neighbour from fixing a beam  in his wall. Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) then said: What is this that I see you  evading (this injunction of the Holy Prophet)? By Allah, I will certainly throw it between  your shoulders (narrate this to you.)

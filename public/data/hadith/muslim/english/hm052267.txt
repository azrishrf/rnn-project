5|2267|  Chapter: One for whom begging is permissible.  Abu Huraira is reported to have heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  as saying: It is letter for one among you to bring a load of firewood on his back and give  charity out of it (and satisfy his own need) and be independent of people, than that he  should beg from people, whether they give him anything or refuse him. Verily the upper  hand is better than the lower hand, and begin (charity) with your dependants.

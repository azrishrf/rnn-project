7|3170|  Chapter: Eminence of Medina, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) showered  blessings upon it. Its sacredness and unlawfulness of hunting and lopping of trees and  demarcation its precincts.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the people saw the first fruit  (of the season or of plantation) they brought it to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him). When he received it he said: O Allah, bless us in our fruits; and bless us in our  city; and bless us in our sa’s and bless us in our mudd. O Allah, Ibrahim was Thy  servant, Thy friend, and Thy apostle; and I am Thy servant and Thy apostle. He  (Ibrahim) made supplication to Thee for (the showering of blessings upon) Mecca, and I  am making supplication to Thee for Medina just as he made supplication to Thee for  Mecca, and the like of it in addition. He would then call to him the youngest child and  give him these fruits.

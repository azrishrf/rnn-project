8|3428|  Chapter: Suckling of a young (boy).  Zainab daughter of Abu Salama reported: I heard Umm Salama, the wife of Allah’s  Apostle (May peace be upon him) saying to ‘Aisha: By Allah, I do not like to be seen by  a young boy who has passed the period of fosterage, whereupon she (‘Aisha) said: Why  is it so? Sahla daughter of Suhail came to Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him)  and said: Allah’s Messenger, I swear by Allah that I see in the face of Abu Hudhaifa (the  signs of disgust) on account of entering of Salim (in the house), whereupon Allah’s  Messenger (May peace be upon him) said: Suckle him. She (Sahla bint Suhail) said: He  has a heard. But he (again) said: Suckle him, and it would remove what is there  (expression of disgust) on the face of Abu Hudhaifa. She said: (I did that) and, by Allah,  I did not see (any sign of disgust) on the face of Abu Hadhaifa.

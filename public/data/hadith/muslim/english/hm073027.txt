7|3027|  Chapter: It is permissible to join seven persons in a cow or a camel.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: We joined Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) in Hajj and Umra and seven persons shared in the sacrifice of an  animal. A person said to Jabir (Allah be pleased with him): Can seven persons share in  the sacrifice of al-Badnah (a camel) as he shares in al-Jazur (a cow)? He, (Jabir) said: It  (al-Jazur) is nothing but one among the budun. Jabir was present at Hudaibiya and he  said: We sacrificed on that day seventy camel, and seven men shared in each sacrifice  (of camel).

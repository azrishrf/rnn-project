7|2701|  Chapter: Hunting is forbidden for one who is in the state of Ihram.  Al-Sa’b b. Jaththama al-Laithi reported that he presented a wild ass to Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) when he was at al-Abwa’, or Waddan, and he  refused to accept it. He (the narrator) said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) looked into my face (which had the mark of dejection as my present had  been rejected by him) he (in order to console me) said: We have refused it only  because we are in a state of Ihram.

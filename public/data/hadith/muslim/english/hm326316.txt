32|6316|  Chapter: The merit of self control at the time of anger.  Sulaiman b. Surad reported that two persons abused each other in the presence of  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and the eyes of one of them became red as  embers and the veins of his neck were swollen. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: I know of a wording, if he were to utter that, his fit of rage  (would be no more and that wording is): I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the  accursed. The person said: Do you find any madness in me? Ibn al-‘Ala’ said: Do you  see it? And he made no mention of the person.  OF RELATIONSHIP

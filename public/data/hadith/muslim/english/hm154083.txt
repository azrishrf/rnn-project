15|4083|  Chapter: How should the masters treat their slaves and expiation if they show high- handedness.  Hilal b. Yasaf reported: We used to sell cloth in the house of Suwaid b. Muqarrin, the  brother of Nuâ€™man b. Muqarrin. There came out a slave-girl, and she said something to  a person amongst us, and he slapped her. Suwaid was enraged-the rest of the hadith is  the same.

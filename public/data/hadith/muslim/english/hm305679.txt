30|5679|  Chapter: When Allah the Exalted intends to show mercy to an Umma His Prophet is called back  to his eternal home when the Umma is safe from the wrath of God.  Abu Musa reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When Allah, the  Exalted and Glorious, intends to show mercy to an Umma from amongst His servants He calls  back His Apostle to his eternal home and makes him a harbinger and recompense in the world to  come; and when He intends to cause destruction to an Umma, He punishes it while its Apostle is  alive and He destroys it as he (the Apostle) witnesses it and he cools his eyes by destruction as  they had belied him and disobeyed his command.

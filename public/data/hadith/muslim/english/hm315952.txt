31|5952|  Chapter: The merits of Hasan and Husain (Allah be pleased with both of them).  Abu Huraira reported: I went along with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) at  a time during the day but he did not talk to me and I did not talk to him until he reached  Bazar of Banfi Qainuqal. He came back to the tent of Fatima and said: Is the little chap  (meaning Hasan) there? We were under the impression that his mother had detained  him in order to bathe him and dress him and garland him with a sweet garland. Not  much time had passed that he (Hasan) came running until both of them embraced each  other, thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, I love him;  love him Thou and love one who loves him (Hasan).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

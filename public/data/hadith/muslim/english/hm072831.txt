7|2831|  Chapter: Permissibility of the Tamattu’ (form of pilgrimage).         ‘Imran b. Husain said: There was revealed the verse of Tamattu’ in Hajj in the Book of  Allah and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) commanded us to perform  it and then no verse was revealed abrogating the Tamattu’ (form of Hajj), and the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not forbid to do it till he died. So  whatever a person said was his personal opinion. A Hadith like this is transmitted on the  authority of Imran b. Husain, but with this variation that he (‘Imran) said: We did that  (Tamattu’) in the company of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he did  not say anything but he (the Holy Prophet) commanded us to do it.

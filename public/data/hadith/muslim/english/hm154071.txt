15|4071|  Chapter: It is forbidden to persist in an oath which causes trouble to the family and is not lawful.  Hammam b. Munabbih reported: This is what Abu Huraira reported to us from Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he narrated a hadith and (one) of them is  that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I swear by Allah, it is more sinful  in Allah’s sight for one of you to persist in an oath regarding his family than payment of  its expiation which Allah has imposed upon him (for breaking the oath).

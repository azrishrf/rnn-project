8|3356|  Chapter: It is not permissible to marry a woman, who is divorced by three pronouncements until  she is married to another, man and he has a sexual intercourse with her, and then he abandons  her and she completes her ‘Idda.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Rifa’a al Qurazi divorced his wife and  afterwards Abd al-Rahman b. al-Zubair married her. She came to Allah’s Apostle (may  peace he upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, Rifa’a has divorced me by three  pronouncements. (The rest of the hadith is the same.)

9|3521|  Chapter: There is no maintenance allowance for one who has been given irrevocable  divorce.  Sha’bi reported: We visited Fatima hint Qais and she served us fresh dates and a drink  of barley flour, and I asked where a woman who has been divorced by three  pronouncements should, spend the period of her ‘Idda. She said: My husband divorced  me with three pronouncements, and Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) permitted  me to spend my ‘Idda period in my family (with my parents).

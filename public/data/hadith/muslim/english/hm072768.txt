7|2768|  Chapter: Types of Ihram- It is permissible to enter into the state of Ihram singularly for  the sake of Hajj or for tamattu’ bi’l-‘umra ila’l-Hajj or for both hajj and ‘umra together.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: We went with the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him? (in his) Farewell Pilgrimage near the time of the appearance of the  new moon of Dhu’I-Hijja. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He  who amongst you intends to put on Ihram for Umra may do so; bad I not brought  sacrificial animal along with me, I would have put on Ihram for Umra. She (further said).  There were some persons who put on Ihram for Umra, and some persons who put on  Ihram for Hajj, and I was one of those who put on Ihram for Umra. We went on till we  reached Mecca, and on the day of ‘Arafa I found myself In a state of menses, but I did  not put off the Ihram for Umra. I told about (this state of mine) to the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: Abandon your ‘Umra, and undo the hair  of your head and comb (them), and put on Ihram for Hajj ‘she(‘Aisha)said: I did  accordingly. When it was the night at Hasba and Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj,  he (the Holy Prophet) sent with me Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr, and he mounted me  behind him on his camel and took me to Tan’im and I put on Ihram for ‘Umra, and thus  Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj and Umra and (we wore required to observe)  neither sacrifice nor alms nor fasting.

8|3445|  Chapter: How long after marrying one should stay with a virgin or a woman previously married.  Abu Bakr b. ‘Abd al-Rahman reported that when Allah’s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) married Umm Salama and he visited her, and when he intended to come out,  she caught hold of his cloth, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him)  said: If you so desire, I can extend the time (of my stay) with you, but then I shall have         to calculate the time (that I stay with you and shall have to spend the same time with  other wives). For the virgin woman, (her husband has to stay with her) for a week and  for the woman previously married it is three days.

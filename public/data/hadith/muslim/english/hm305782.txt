30|5782|  Chapter: Pertaining to the old age of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Thabit reported that Anas b. Malik was asked about the dyeing (of the hair of) Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him). Thereupon he said.: (They were so few) that if I so  liked I could count their number in his head, and he further said: (That is) he did not dye.  Abu Bakr, however, dyed them and so did ‘Umar dye them with pure henna.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

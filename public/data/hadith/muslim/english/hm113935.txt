11|3935|  Chapter: The law of inheritance in regard to al-Kalala (the person who dies leaving no  child or parent).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him)reported: Whilo I was ill Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) came to me and found me unconscious. He(the Holy  Prophet) performed ablution, and sprinkled over me the water of his ablution. I regained  my consciousness and said: Allah’s Messenger, my case of inheritance is that of Kalala.  Then the verse pertaining to the inheritance (of Kalala) was revealed. I (one of the  narrators) said: I said to Muhammad b. Munkadir: (Do you mean this verse) “They ask  you ; say: Allah gives you decision in regard to Kalala” (iv. 177)? He said: Yes, it was  thus revealed.

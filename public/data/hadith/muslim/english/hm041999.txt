4|1999|  Chapter: What is to be said at the time of calamity.  Umm Salama reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If any  Muslim who suffers some calamity says, what Allah has commanded him, “We belong  to Allah and to Him shall we return; O Allah, reward me for my affliction and give me  something better than it in exchange for it,” Allah will give him something better than it in  exchange. When Abu Salama died she said: What Muslim is better than Abu Salama  whose family was the first to emigrate to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him). I then said the words, and Allah gave me God’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) in exchange. She said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent  Hatib b. Abu Balta’a to deliver me the message of marriage with him. I said to him: I  have a daughter (as my dependant) and I am of jealous temperament. He (the Holy  Prophet) said: So far as her daughter is concerned, we would supplicate Allah, that He  may free her (of her responsibility) and I would also supplicate Allah to do away with  (her) jealous (temperament).

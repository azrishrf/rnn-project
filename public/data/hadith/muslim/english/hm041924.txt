4|1924|  Chapter: Prayer (Sunan) after the Jumu’a prayer (Fard) The prayer of the two Id’s.  Ibn ‘Abbas reported: I bear testimony to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) offering prayer before Kbutba. He (after saying prayer) delivered the Kutba, and he  found that the women could not hear it, so he came to them and exhorted them and  preached them and commanded them to give alms, and Bilal had stretched his cloth  and the women were throwing rings, earrings and other things. This Hadith has been  narrated on the authority of Ayyub with the same chain of transmitters.

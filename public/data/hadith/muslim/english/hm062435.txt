6|2435|  Chapter: It is forbidden to observe uninterrupted fasting.  â€˜Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) said: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  forbade them (his Companions) to observe Saum Wisal out of mercy for them. They  said: You (Holy Prophet) yourself observe it. Upon this he said: I am not like you. My  Lord feeds me and provides me drink.

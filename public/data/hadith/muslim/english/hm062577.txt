6|2577|  Chapter: The fasts observed by the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) besides  Ramadhan.  ‘Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported: I said to ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her): Did the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observe fast during a month? She said, I  do not know of any month in which he fasted throughout except Ramadan and (the  month) in which he did not fast at all till he ran the course of his life. May peace be upon  him.

40|6786|  Chapter: There is in paradise a tree under the shadow of which a rider can travel for a hundred  years and even then he would not be able to cover it.  Sahl b. Sa’d reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: In  Paradise, there is a tree under the shadow of which a rider can travel for a hundred  years without covering (the distance) completely. This hadith has also been transmitted  on the authority of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) is  reported to have said: In Paradise, there is a tree under the shadow of which a rider of a  fine and swift-footed horse would travel for a hundred years without covering the  distance completely. There would be the pleasure of Allah for the inmates of Paradise  and He would never be annoyed with them.  INTIMATES

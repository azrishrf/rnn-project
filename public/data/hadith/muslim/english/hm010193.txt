1|193|  Chapter: Serious prohibition of letting down the lower garment: of laying obligation of  selling goods by false oaths, and description of those three (persons) with whom Allah  would not speak on the Day of Resurrection nor would He see towards them nor would  absolve them, and for them is a painful chastisement.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr who narrates that the Prophet (may peace  be upon him) observed: Three are the persons with whom Allah would not speak on the  Day of Resurrection: the bestower of gift who does not give anything but by laying  obligation on him, the seller of goods who sells them by taking false oath and one who  hangs low his lower garment.

20|4724|  Chapter: Keeping the good of the animals in view during a journey and forbiddance  from halting for the night on the track.  It has been narrated (through another chain of transmitters) on the authority of Abu  Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When you travel  (through a land) where there is plenty of vegetation, you should (go slow and) give the  camels a chance to enjoy the benefit of the earth. When you travel (through a land)  where there is scarcity of vegetation, you should hasten with them (so that you may be  able to cross that land while your animals ore still in a good condition of health). When  you make a halt for the night, avoid (doing so on) the road, for the tracks are the  pathways of wild beasts or the abode of noxious little animals.

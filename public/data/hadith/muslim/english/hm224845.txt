22|4845|  Chapter: It is meritorious to sacrifice the animal with one’s own hand and so is  meritorious the recitation of Bismillah (in the name of Allah) and Takbir (Allah o-Akbar).  ‘Aisha reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded that a  ram with black legs, black belly and black (circles) round the eyes should be brought to  him, so that he should sacrifice it. He said to ‘Aisha: Give me the large knife, and then  said: Sharpen it on a stone. She did that. He then took it (the knife) and then the ram;  he placed it on the ground and then sacrificed it, saying: Bismillah, Allah-humma  Taqabbal min Muhammadin wa Al-i-Muhammadin, wa min Ummati Muhammadin (In the  name of Allah, “O Allah, accept [this sacrifice] on behalf of Muhammad and the family of  Muhammad and the Umma of Muhammad”).

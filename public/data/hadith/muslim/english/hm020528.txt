2|528|  Chapter: Wiping over the socks.  Mughira b. Shuâ€™ba reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) went out  for relieving himself. When he came back I brought for him a jar (of water) and poured  water upon his hands and He washed his face. He tried to wash his forearms, but as the  (sleeves of the) gown were tight. He, therefore, brought them out from under the gown.  He then washed them, wiped his head, and wiped his socks and then prayed.

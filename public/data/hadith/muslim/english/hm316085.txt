31|6085|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Huraira Al-Dawsi Al-Yamani (Allah be pleased with him).  ‘Aisha reported: Don’t you feel surprised at Abu Huraira? He came (one day) and sat  beside the nook of my apartment and began to narrate (the hadith of Allah’s Apostle). I  was hearing while I was engaged in extolling Allah (reciting Subhan Allah) constantly.  He stood up before I finished my repetition of Subhan Allah, if I were to meet him I  would have warned him in stern words that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) did not speak so quickly as you talk. Ibn Shihab transmitted on the authority of Ibn  Musayyib that Abu Huraira said: People say that Abu Huraira transmits so many  ahadith, whereas Allah is the Reckoner, and they say: How is it with Muhajirs and the  Ansar that they do not narrate ahadith like him (like Abu Huraira)? Abu Huraira said: I  tell you that my brothers from Ansar remained busy with their lands and my brothers  Muhajirs were busy in transactions in the bazars, but I always kept myself attached to  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with bare subsistence. I remained present  (in the company of the Holy Prophet), whereas they had been absent. I retained in my         mind (what the Holy Prophet said), whereas they forgot it. One day Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) said: He who amongst you spreads the cloth and listens to  my talk and would then press it against his chest would never forget anything heard  from me. So I spread my mantle and when he had concluded his talk I then pressed it  against my chest and so I never forgot after that day anything that he (the Holy Prophet)  said. And if these two verses would not have been revealed in the Book I would have  never transmitted anything (to anybody): “Those who conceal the clear evidence and  the guidance that We revealed” (ii. 159) tip to the last verse.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

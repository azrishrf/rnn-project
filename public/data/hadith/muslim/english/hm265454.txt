26|5454|  Chapter: The excellence of curing (with the help of incantation) the influence of the evil eye and  small pustules and the poison (especially of snake and scorpion).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported I had a maternal uncle who treated the sting of the scorpion  with the help of incantation. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade  incantation. He came to him and said: Allah’s Messenger, you forbade to practise  incantation, whereas I employ it for curing the sting of the scorpion, whereupon he said:  He who amongst you is capable of employing it as a means to do good should do that.

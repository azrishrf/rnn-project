26|5536|  Chapter: Kahanat (Divination) is prohibited and it is forbidden to go to Kahin.  ‘Urwa reported from ‘Aisha that she said that people asked Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) about the kahins. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said  to them: It is nothing (i.e. it is a mere superstition). They said: Allah’s Messenger, they  at times narrate to us things which we find true. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: That is a word pertaining to truth which a jinn snatches away  and then cackles into the ear of his friend as the hen does. And then they mix in it more  than one hundred lies.

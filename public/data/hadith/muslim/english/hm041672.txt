4|1672|  Chapter: Encouragement to observe prayers during Ramadhan and that is Tarawih.  Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbas, reported that Ibn ‘Abbas narrated to him that he  spent a night in the house of Maimuna, the mother of the believers, who was his  mother’s sister. I lay down across the cushion, whereas the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) and his wife lay down on it length-wise. The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) slept up till midnight, or a little before midnight of a little after  midnight, and then got up and began to cast off the effects of sleep from his face by  rubbing with his hand, and then recited the ten concluding verses of Surah ‘Imran. He  then stood up near a hanging water-skin and performed ablution well, and then stood up  and prayed, ‘Ibn ‘Abbas said: I also stood up and did the same, as the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) had done, and then went to him and stood by his side.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) placed his right hand upon my head  and took hold of my right ear and twisted it, and then observed a pair of rak’ahs, again a  pair of rak’ahs, again a pair of rak’ahs, again a pair of rak’ahs, again a pair of rak’ahs,  again a pair of rak’ahs, and then observed Witr and then lay down till the Mu’adhdhin  came to him. He (the Holy Prophet) then stood up and observed two short rak’ahs, and  then went out (to the mosque) and observed the dawn prayer.

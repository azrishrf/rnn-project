21|4769|  Chapter: The eating of the flesh of domestic asses is unlawful.  Sulaiman Shaibini reported: I heard Abdullah b. Abu Aufa say: We were smitten with  hunger during the nights of Khaibar. On the Day of Khaibar, we fell upon domestic  asses and we slaughtered them, and when our earthen pots boiled with them, the  announcer of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made an announcement that  the earthen pots should be turned over, and nothing should be eaten of the flesh of the  domestic asses. Some of the people said that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) had forbidden (the use of this flesh) for one-fifth (due to the State) has not been  paid, while others said: He prohibited it for ever.

30|5730|  Chapter: It is very seldom that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said ‘No” to anyone  when asked to give anything, and he gave charity to the people very freely.  Ibn Shihab reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went on the  expedition of Victory, i.e. the Victory of Mecca, and then he went out along with the  Muslims and they fought at Hunain, and Allah granted victory to his religion and to the  Muslims, and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave one hundred camels to  Safwan b. Umayya. He again gave him one hundred camels, and then again gave him  one hundred camels. Sa’id b. Musayyib said that Safwan told him: (By Allah) Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave me what he gave me (and my state of mind  at that time was) that he was the most detested person amongst people in my eyes. But  he continued giving to me until now he is the dearest of people to me.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

25|5314|  Chapter: Forbiddance in calling one (other than Allah’s Apostle) with the Kunya of Abdu’l- Qasim and the fact pertaining to good names.  Anas reported that person at Baqi’ called another person as “Abu’l-Qasim,” and Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) turned towards him. He (the person who had  uttered these words) said: Messenger of Allah, I did not mean you, but I called such and  such (person), whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: You may  call yourself by my name, but not by my kunya.

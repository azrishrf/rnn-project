4|1816|  Chapter: How Amr b. Abasa embraced Islam.  Abu Salama asked ‘Aisha about the two prostrations (i.e. rak’ahs) which the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) made after the ‘Asr. She said: He (the Holy Prophet)  observed them before the ‘Asr prayer, but then he was hindered to do so, or he forgot  them and then he observed them after the ‘Asr, and then he continued observing them.  (It was his habit) that when he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer, he then continued  observing it. Isma’il said: It implies that he always did that.

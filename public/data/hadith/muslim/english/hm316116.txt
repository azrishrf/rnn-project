31|6116|  Chapter: Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) invoked blessings upon the tribes of Ghifar  and Aslam.         Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: To the  tribe of Aslam Allah has granted safety and to the tribe of Ghifar Allah has granted  pardon. Verily it is not I that say this, but (it is) Allah the Exalted and Glorious. (who)  says this.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

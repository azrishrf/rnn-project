13|4013|  Chapter: He who has not anything with him to will away should not do it.  Aswad b. Yazid reported: It was mentioned before ‘Aisha that will had been made (by  the Holy Prophet) in favour of ‘Ali (as the Prophet’s first caliph), whereupon she said:  When did he make will in his favour? I had been providing support to him (to the Holy  Prophet) with my chest (or with my lap). He asked for a tray, when he fell in my lap  (relaxing his body), and I did not realise that he had breathed his last. When did he  make any will in his (‘Ali’s) favour?

1|212|  Chapter: Concerning the wind which would blow near the Day of Resurrection and  would cause to die anyone having anything like faith in his heart.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: Verily Allah would make a wind to blow from the side of the Yemen  more delicate than silk and would spare none but cause him to die who, in the words of  Abu ‘Alqama, has faith equal to the weight of a grain; while Abdul-‘Aziz said: having  faith equal to the weight of a dust particle.

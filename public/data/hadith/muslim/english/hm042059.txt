4|2059|  Chapter: Making haste in funeral.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: Make haste  at a funeral; if the dead person was good, it is a good state to which you are sending  him on; but if he was otherwise it is an evil of which you are ridding yourselves.

41|7002|  Chapter: Story of Ibn Sayyid.  Ibn ‘Umar reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened to pass  by Ibn Sayyad along with his Companions including ‘Umar b. Khattab as he was playing  with children near the battlement of Bani Maghala and he was also a child by that time.  The rest of the hadith is the same as narrated by Ibn Umar (in which there is a mention  of) setting out of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) along with Ubayy b. Ka’b  towards the date-palm trees.

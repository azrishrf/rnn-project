5|2275|  Chapter: Disapproval of the longing for the (possessions of the material) world.  Ibn al-Sa’di Maliki reported: ‘Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) appointed me  as a collector of Sadaqa. When I had finished that (the task assigned to me) and I  handed over that to him (to ‘Umar), he commanded me to (accept) some remuneration  (for the work). I said: I performed this duty for Allah and my reward is with Allah. He  said: Take whatever has been given to you, for I also performed this duty during the  time of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He assigned me the task of a  collector and I said as you say, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  said to me: When you are given anything without your begging for it, (then accept it), eat  it and give it in charity.

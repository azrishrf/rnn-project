31|6006|  Chapter: The merits of Umm Salama, the mother of the faithful (Allah be pleased with her).  Salman reported: In case it lies in your power don’t be one to enter the bazar first and  the last to get out of that because there is a bustle and the standard of Satan is set  there. He said: I was informed that Gabriel (Allah be pleased with him) came to Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) and there was with him Umin Salama and he began  to talk with him. He then stood up, whereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  said to Umm Salama: (Do you know) who was he and what did he say? She said: He  was Dihya (Kalbi). He reported Umm Salama having said: By Allah, I did not deem him  but only he (Dihya) until I heard the address of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  informing him about us. He (the narrator) said: I said to Uthman: From whom did you  hear it? He said: From Usima b. Zaid.           HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

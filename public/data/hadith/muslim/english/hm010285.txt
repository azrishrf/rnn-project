1|285|  Chapter: The necessity of affirming the Prophethood of our Apostle Muhammad (may  peace be upon him) who is the Apostle sent to the whole of humanity. and the  abrogation of other religions with his religion.  It is narrated on the authority of Sha’bi that one among the citizens of Khurasan asked  him: O Abu! some of the people amongst us who belong to Khurasan say that a person  who freed his bondswoman and then married her is like one who rode over a sacrificial  animal. Sha’bi said: Abu Burda b. Abi Musa narrated it to me on the authority of his  father that verily the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: There are three  (classes of persons) who would be given a double reward. One who is amongst the  People of the Book and believed in his apostle and (lived) to see the time of Apostle  Muhammad (may peace be upon him) and affirmed his faith in him and followed him  and attested his truth, for him is the double reward; and the slave of the master who         discharges all those obligations that he owes to Allah and discharges his duties that he  owes to his master, for him there is a double reward. And a man who had a  bondswoman and fed her and fed her well, then taught her good manners, and did that  well and later on granted her freedom and married her, for him is the double reward.  Then Sha’bi said: Accept this hadith without (giving) anything. Formerly a man was  (obliged) to travel to Medina even for a smaller hadith than this.

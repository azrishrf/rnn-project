30|5833|  Chapter: The merit of looking at the face of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and  longing for it.  Abu Huraira reported so many ahadith from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) and one among them was that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is  reported to have said: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, a day would  come to you when you would not be able to see me, and the glimpse of my face would  be dearer to one than one’s own family, one’s property and in fact everything. This  hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Ishaq with a slight variation of wording.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

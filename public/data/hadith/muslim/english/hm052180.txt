5|2180|  Chapter: Beginning of spending for one’s own self, then for one’s family and then for relatives.  Thauban reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The most  excellent dinar is one that a person spends on his family, and the dinar which he spends  on his animal in Allah’s path, and the dinar he spends on his companions in Allah’s  path. Abu Qilaba (one of the narrators) said: He (the narrator) started with family, and  then Abu Qilaba said: Who is the person with greater reward than a person who spends  on young members of his family (and thus) preserves (saves them from want) (and by  virtue of which) Allah brings profit for them and makes them rich.

20|4535|  Chapter: Obedience to the ruler is forbidden in matters sinful, but is otherwise  obligatory.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman from ‘Ali that the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent a force (on a mission) and appointed  over them a man. He kindled a fire and said: Enter it. Some people made up their minds  to enter it (the fire), (carrying out the order of their commander), but the others said: We  fled from the fire (that’s why we have come into the fold of Islam). The matter was  reported to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said to those who  Contemplated entering (the fire at the order of their commander): If you had entered it,  you would have remained there until the Day of Judgment. He commanded the act of  the latter group and said: There is no submission in matters involving God’s  disobedience or displeasure. Submission is obligatory only in what is good (and  reasonable).

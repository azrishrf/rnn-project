32|6214|  Chapter: Forbiddance of suspicion, fault-finding, and bidding against the other, (for raising the  price).  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Avoid  suspicion, for suspicion is the gravest lie in talk and do not be inquisitive about one  another and do not spy upon one another and do not feel envy with the other, and nurse  no malice, and nurse no aversion and hostility against one another. And be fellow- brothers and servants of Allah.  OF RELATIONSHIP

4|1266|  Chapter: When should the people stand up for prayer.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who  finds (gets) a rak’ah of the afternoon (prayer) before the setting of the sun, he in fact  gets (the full prayer), and he who gets a rak’ah of the morning (prayer) before the rising  of the sun he in fact gets (the full prayer).

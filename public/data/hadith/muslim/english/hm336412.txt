33|6412|  Chapter: The excellence of arguments between Adam and Moses (Allah be pleased with both  of them).  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There  was an argument between Adam and Moses. Moses said: Are you that Adam whose  lapse caused you to get out of Paradise? Adam said to him: Are you that Moses whom  Allah selected for His Messenger-ship, for His conversation and you blame me for an  affair which had been ordained for me before I was created? This is how Adam came  the better of Moses.

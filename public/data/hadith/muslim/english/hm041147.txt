4|1147|  Chapter: When food is brought before man and he is inclined to take it, he should not  say prayer before eating it and undesirability of prayer while feeling the call of nature.  Jabir b. â€˜Abdullah reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) Saying: He  who eats of this (offensive) plant, i.e. garlic, and sometimes he said: He who eats onion  and garlic and leek, should not approach our mosque for the angels are harmed by the  same things as the children of Adam.

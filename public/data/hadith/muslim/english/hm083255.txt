8|3255|  Chapter: Temporary marriage and its prohibition for all times to come.  Sabra al-Juhanni reported on the authority of his father that while he was with Allahâ€™s  Messenger (May peace be upon him) he said: O people, I had permitted you to contract  temporary marriage with women, but Allah has forbidden it (now) until the Day of  Resurrection. So he who has any (woman with this type of marriage contract) he should  let her off, and do not take back anything you have given to then (as dower).

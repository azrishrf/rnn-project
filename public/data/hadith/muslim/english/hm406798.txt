40|6798|  Chapter: The description of Paradise and the remembrance of Allah by the inmates morning  and evening.  Jabir reported: I heard Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying that the  inmates of Paradise would eat and drink but would neither spit, nor pass water, nor void  excrement, nor suffer catarrah. It was said: Then, what would happen with food?  Thereupon he said: They would belch and sweat (and it would be over with their food),  and their sweat would be that of musk and they would glorify and praise Allah as easily  as you breathe.

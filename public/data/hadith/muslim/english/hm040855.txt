4|855|  Chapter: If something happens in prayers, men should glorify Allah and women should clap  hands.  Anas b. Malik reported. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Perform  bowing and prostration well. By Allah, I see you even if you are behind me, or he said: (I  see you) behind my back when you bow or prostrate.

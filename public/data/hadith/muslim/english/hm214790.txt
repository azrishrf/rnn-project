21|4790|  Chapter: Pertaining to the flesh of the Lizard.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Abbas reported: I and Khalid b. Walid went to the apartment of Maimuna  along with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and there was presented to  him a roasted lizard. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stretched his hand  towards It, whereupon some of the women who had been in the house of Maimuna  said: Inform Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) what he intends to eat. Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) lifted his hand. I said: Messenger of Allah, Is it  forbidden? He said: No. It is not found in the land of my people, and I feel that I have no  liking for it. Khalid said: I then chewed and ate it, while, Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) was looking (at me).

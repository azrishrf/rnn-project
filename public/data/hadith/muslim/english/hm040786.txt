4|786|  Chapter: The one led in prayer is forbidden to recite loudly behind the Imam.  Anas reported: I observed prayer along with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) and with Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman (may Allah be pleased with all of  them), but I never heard any one of them reciting Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim loudly.

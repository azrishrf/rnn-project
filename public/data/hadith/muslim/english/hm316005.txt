31|6005|  Chapter: The merits of Fatima, daughter of Allah’s apostle (may peace be upon him).  ‘Aisha reported that all the wives of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had  gathered (in her apartment) during the days of his (Prophet’s) last illness and no woman  was left behind that Fatima, who walked after the style of Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him), came there. He welcomed her by saying: You are welcome, my  daughter, and made her sit on his right side or on his left side, and then talked  something secretly to her and Fatima wept. Then he talked something secretly to her  and she laughed. I said to her: What makes you weep? She said; I am not going to  divulge the secret of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I (‘Aisha) said: I have  not seen (anything happening) like today, the happiness being more close to grief (as I  see today) when she wept. I said to her: Has Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) singled you out for saying something leaving us aside? She then wept and I asked  her what he said, and she said: I am not going to divulge the secrets of Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him). And when he died I again asked her and she  said that he (the Holy Prophet) told her: Gabriel used to recite the Qur’an to me once a  year and for this year it was twice and so I perceived that my death had drawn near,  and that I (‘Aisha) would be the first amongst the members of his family who would meet  him (in the Hereafter). He shall be my good forerunner and it made me weep. He again  talked to me secretly (saying): Aren’t you pleased that you should be the sovereign  amongst the believing women or the head of women of this Umma? And this made me  laugh.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

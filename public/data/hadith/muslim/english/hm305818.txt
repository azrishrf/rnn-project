30|5818|  Chapter: Respect of Allah’s Messenger and abandoning of too many questions especially those  for which there is no genuine need.  Abu Huraira reported that he heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as  saying: Avoid that which I forbid you to do and do that which I command you to do to the  best of your capacity. Verily the people before you went to their doom because they had  put too many questions to their Prophets and then disagreed with their teachings.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

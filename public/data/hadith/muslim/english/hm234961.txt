23|4961|  Chapter: Every intoxicant is Khamr and every Khamr is forbidden.  Abu Burda reported on the authority of his father: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) sent me and Mu’adh to Yemen saying: Call people (to the path of  righteousness) and give good tidings to the (people), and do not repel them, make  things easy for them and do not make things difficult. I (Burda) said: Allah’s Messenger,  give us a religious verdict about two kinds of drinks which we prepare in Yemen. One is  Bit’ which is prepared from honey; it is a fermented Nabidh and is strong and turns into  wine, and (the second is) Mizr which is prepared from millet and barley. Thereupon,  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), who had been gifted with the most  eloquent and pithy expressions, said: I forbid you from every intoxicant that keeps you  away from prayer.

17|4207|  Chapter: He who confesses his guilt of adultery.  Imran b. Husain reported that a woman from Juhaina came to Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) and she had become pregnant because of adultery. She said:  Allah’s Apostle, I have done something for which (prescribed punishment) must be  imposed upon me, so impose that. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) called her  master and said: Treat her well, and when she delivers bring her to me. He did  accordingly. Then Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) pronounced judgment  about her and her clothes were tied around her and then he commanded and she was  stoned to death. He then prayed over her (dead body). Thereupon Umar said to him:  Allah’s Apostle, you offer prayer for her, whereas she had committed adultery !  Thereupon he said: She has made such a repentance that if it were to be divided  among seventy men of Medina, it would be enough. Have you found any repentance  better than this that she sacrificed her life for Allah, the Majestic?

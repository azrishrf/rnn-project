1|380|  Chapter: The lowest of the ranks in Paradise.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira and Hudhaifa that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, would gather people.  The believers would stand till the Paradise would be brought near them. They would  come to Adam and say: O our father, open for us the Paradise. He would say: What  turned ye out from the Paradise was the sin of your father Adam. I am not in a position         to do that; better go to my son Ibrahim, the Friend of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said:  He (Ibrahim) would say: I am not in a position to do that. Verily I had been the Friend (of  Allah) from beyond, beyond; you better approach Moses (peace be upon him) with  whom Allah conversed. They would come to Moses (peace be upon him), but he would  say: I am not in a position to do that; you better go to Jesus, the Word of Allah and His  Spirit. Jesus (peace be upon him) would say: I am not in a position to do that. So they  would come to Muhammad (may peace be upon him). He would then be permitted (to  open the door of Paradise). Trust worthiness and kinship would be despatched, and  these would stand on the right and left of the Path and the first of you would pass with  (the swiftness) of lightning. He (the narrator) said: I said, O thou who art far dearer to  me than my father and my mother I which thing is like the passing of lightning? He said:  Have you not seen lightning, how it passes and then comes back within the twinkling of  an eye? Then (they would pass) like the passing of the wind, then like the passing of a  bird, and the hastening of persons would be according to their deeds, and your Apostle  would be standing on the Path saying: Save, O my Lord, save. (The people would go on  passing) till the deeds of the servants would be failing in strength, till a man would come  who would find it hard to go along (that Path) but crawlingly. He (the narrator) said: And  on the sides of the Path hooks would be suspended ready to catch anyone whom these  would be required (to catch). There would be those who would somehow or other  succeed in transversing that Path and some would be piled up in Hell. By Him in Whose  Hand is the life of Abu Huraira it would take one seventy years to fathom the depth of  Hell.

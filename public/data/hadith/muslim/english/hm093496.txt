9|3496|  Chapter: Atonement is essential for one who made his wife unlawful for himself without  the intention of divorce.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) narrated that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) used to spend time with Zainab daughter of Jahsh and drank honey at her house.  She (‘Aisha further) said: I and Hafsa agreed that one whom Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him) would visit first should say: I notice that you have an odour of the Maghafir  (gum of mimosa). He (the Holy Prophet) visited one of them and she said to him like  this, whereupon he said: I have taken honey in the house of Zainab bint Jabsh and I will  never do it again. It was at this (that the following verse was revealed): Why do you hold  to be forbidden what Allah has made lawful for you... (up to). If you both (‘Aisha and  Hafsa) turn to Allah” up to: “And when the Holy Prophet confided an information to one  of his wives” (lxvi. 3). This refers to his saying: But I have taken honey.

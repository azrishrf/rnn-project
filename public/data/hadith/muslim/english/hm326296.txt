Abdullah reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I am  a human being and I have made this term with my Lord, the Exalted and Glorious: For  any servant amongst Muslims whom I curse or scold, make that a source of purity and  reward. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Juraij with the same chain  of transmitters.  OF RELATIONSHIP

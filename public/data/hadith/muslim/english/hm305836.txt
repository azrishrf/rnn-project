30|5836|  Chapter: The merits of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported many ahadith from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  and one is that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am most close to  Jesus, son of Mary, among the whole of mankind in this worldly life and the next life.  They said: Allah’s Messenger how is it? Thereupon he said: Prophets are brothers in  faith, having different mothers. Their religion is, however, one and there is no Apostle  between us (between I and Jesus Christ).  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

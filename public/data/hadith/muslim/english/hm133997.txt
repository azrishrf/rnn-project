13|3997|  Chapter: Will can be made only for one-third.  Humaid b. ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Himyari reported from three of the sons of Sa’d all of  whom reported from their father that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) visited  Sa’d as he was ill in Mecca. He (Sa’d) wept. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What makes  you weep? He said: I am afraid I may die in the land from where I migrated as Sa’d b.  Khaula had died. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah,  grant health to Sa’d. O Allah, grant health to Sad. He repeated it three times. He (Sa’d)         said: Allah’s Messenger, I own a large property and I have only one daughter as my  inheritor. Should I not will away the whole of my property? He (the Holy Prophet) said:  No. He said: (Should I not will away,) two-thirds of the property? he (the Holy Prophet)  said: No. He (Sa’d) (again) said: (Should I not will away) half (of my property)? He said:  No. He (Sa’d) said: Then one-third? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yes), one- third, and one-third is quite substantial. And what you spend as charity from your  property is Sadaqa and flour spending on your family is also Sadaqa, and what your  wife eats from your property is also Sadaqa, and that you leave your heirs well off (or he  said: prosperous) is better than to leave them (poor and) begging from people. He (the  Holy Prophet) pointed this with his hands.

4|942|  Chapter: Recitation in the night prayer.  Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When any  one of you leads the people in prayer, he should be brief for among them are the young  and the aged, the weak and the sick. But when one of you prays by himself, he may  (prolong) as he likes.

5|2298|  Chapter: Bestowal upon one who is firm in faith.  Miswar b. Makhrama reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  distributed some cloaks but did not bestow one upon Makhrama. Upon this Makhrama  said: O my son, come along with me to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him). So I went with him. He said: Enter the house and call him (to come out) for me. So  I called him and he (the Holy Prophet) came out, and there was a cloak (from those  already distributed) on him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I had kept it for you. He  (Makhrama), looked at it and was pleased.

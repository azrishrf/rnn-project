1|83|  Chapter: Precedence of the believers over one another and the superiority of the  people of Yemen in this respect.  It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Mas’ud that the Apostle of Allah (may peace and  blessings be upon him) pointed towards Yemen with his hand and said: Verily Iman is  towards this side, and harshness and callousness of the hearts is found amongst the         rude owners of the camels who drive them behind their tails (to the direction)where  emerge the two horns of Satan, they are the tribes of Rabi’a and Mudar.

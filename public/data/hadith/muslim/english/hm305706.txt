30|5706|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  Anas b. Malik reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: Some  persons from amongst my associates would turn to my Cistern; when I would see them  and they would be presented to me, they would be detained in the way while coming to  me. I would say: My Lord, they are my companions, they are my companions, and it  would be said to me: You don’t know what innovations they made after you.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

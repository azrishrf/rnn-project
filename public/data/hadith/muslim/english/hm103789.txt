10|3789|  Chapter: Command of killing dogs and then its abrogation, and prohibition of keeping them but  for hunting and protection of lands or cattle or like that.  Hudhaifa reported: A person met his Lord (after death) and He said: What (good) did  you do? He said: I did no good except this that I was a rich man, and I demanded from  the people (the repayment of debt that I advanced to them). I, however, accepted that  which the solvent gave and remitted (the debt) of the insolvent, whereupon He (the  Lord) said: You should ignore (the faults) of My servant. Abu Mas’ud (Allah be pleased  with him) said: This is what I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as  saying.

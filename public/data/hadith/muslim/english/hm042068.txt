4|2068|  Chapter: Merit of the funeral prayer and following the bier.  Dawud b. ‘Amir b. Sa’d b. Abu Waqqas reported on the authority of his father that while  he was sitting along with ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar, Khabbab, the owner of Maqsura, said: Ibn  ‘Umar, do you hear what Abu Huraira says that he heard the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) say: “He who goes out with the bier when taken out from its  residence and offers prayer for it and he then follows it till it is buried, he would have two  qirats of reward, each qirat being equivalent to Uhud; and he who, after having offered  prayer, (directly) came back would have his reward (as great) as Uhud”? Ibn ‘Umar sent  Khabbab to ‘Aisha in order to ask her about the words of Abu Huraira (and also told  him) to come back to him (Ibn ‘Umar) and inform him what ‘Aisha said. (In the  meanwhile) Ibn ‘Umar took up a handful of pebbles and turned them over in his hand till  the messenger (Khabbab) came back to him and told (him) that ‘Aisha testified (the  statement of) Abu Huraira. Ibn ‘Umar threw the pebbles he had in his hand on the  ground and then said: We missed a large number of qirats.

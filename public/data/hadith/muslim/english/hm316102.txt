31|6102|  Chapter: The merits of the Ansar (Allah be pleased with them).  Anas b. Malik reported that a woman from the Ansar came to Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood aside with  her and said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, you are dearest to me amongst the  people. He repeated it thrice. This hadith has been reported on the authority of Shu’ba  with the same chain of transmitters.         HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

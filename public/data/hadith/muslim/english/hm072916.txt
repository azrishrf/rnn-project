7|2916|  Chapter: Excellence of kissing the black stone ;while circumambulating.  Suwaid b. Ghafala reported: I saw Umar (Allah be pleased with him) kissing the Stone  and clinging to it and saying: I saw Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having  great love for you. This Hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sufyan with the  same chain of transmitters (and the words are): “That he (‘Umar) said: But I saw Abu’l- Qasim (way peace be upon him) having great love for you.” And he did not mention  about clinging to it.

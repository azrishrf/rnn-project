Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Iraq  would withhold its dirhams and qafiz; Syria would withhold its mudd and dinar and Egypt  would withhold its irdab and dinar and you would recoil to that position from where you  started and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would  recoil to that position from where you started, the bones and the flesh of Abu Huraira  would bear testimony to it.

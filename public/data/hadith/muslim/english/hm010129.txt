1|129|  Chapter: Calling the fugitive slave as infidel.  It is narrated on the authority of Jarir that he heard (the Holy Prophet) saying, The slave  who fled from his master committed an act of infidelity as long as he would not return to  him. Mansur observed: By God, this hadith was narrated from the Apostle (may peace  and blessings be upon him), but I do not like that this should be narrated on my  authority here in Basra.

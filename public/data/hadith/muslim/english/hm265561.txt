26|5561|  Chapter: The desirability of killing a Gecko (House Lizard).  Umm Sharik reported that she consulted Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) in  regard to killing of geckos, and he commanded to kill them and Umm Sharik is one of         the women of Bani ‘Amir b. Luwayy. This hadith has been reported through another  chain of transmitters with the same meaning.

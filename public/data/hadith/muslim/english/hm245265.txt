24|5265|  Chapter: Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.  ‘Aisha, the wife of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), reported that she had  hung a curtain which had pictures upon it. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  entered (the room) and he pulled it. ‘Aisha said: I then tore it and prepared two cushions  out of that. A person who was then in that company and whose name was Rabi’a b.  ‘Ata, the freed slave of Banu Zuhra, asked: Did you hear Abu Muhammad making a  mention of ‘Aisha having stated that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) used  to recline upon them? Ibn al-Qasim said: No, but I heard Qasim b. Muhammad saying  so.

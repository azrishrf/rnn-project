5|2216|  Chapter: The Labourer should give charity out of his wages and it is severely forbidden to  belittle one who contributes less.  ‘Adi b. Hatim reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah will  speak with everyone amongst you without any interpreter between them. He (the man)  would see towards his right and would not find anything but (the deeds) which he had  done before, and he would see towards the left and would not find anything but (the  deeds) which he had done before. He would see in front of him and would find nothing  but Fire just before his face. So protect (yourselves) against Fire even if it is with the  help of half a date. A Hadith like this has been transmitted by Khaithama and addition  has been made in this of (these words); “Even if it is with a good word.”

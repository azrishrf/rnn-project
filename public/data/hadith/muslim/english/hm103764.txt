10|3764|  Chapter: Merit of giving respite to one who is in straitened circumstances.  Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  as saying: Never a Muslim plants a tree, but he has the reward of charity for him, for  what is eaten out of that is charity; what is stolen out of that, what the beasts eat out of  that, what the birds eat out of that is charity for him. (In short) none incurs a loss to him  but it becomes a charity on his part.

8|3395|  Chapter: Kitab Al-Rada’a-Book pertaining to fosterage.         ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon  him) was with her and she heard the voice of a person seeking permission to enter the  house of Hafsa. ‘Aisha (Allah he pleased with her) said: Allah’s Messenger, he is the  person who seeks permission to enter your house, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (May  peace be upon him) said: I think he is so and so (uncle of Hafsa by reason of  fosterage). ‘Aisha said: Messenger of Allah, if so and so (her uncle by reason of  fosterage) were alive, could he enter my house? Allah’s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) said: Yes. Fosterage makes unlawful what consanguinity makes unlawful.

Khuwailid (sister of Khadija)sought permission from Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) to see him and he was reminded of Khadija’s  (manner of) asking leave to enter and (was overwhelmed) with emotions thereby and  said: O Allah, it is Hala, daughter of Khuwailid, and I felt jealous and said: Why do you  remember one of those old women of the Quraish with gums red and who is long dead- while Allah has given you a better one in her stead?

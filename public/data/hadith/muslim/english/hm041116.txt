4|1116|  Chapter: It is forbidden to remove pebbles and smooth the ground while engaged in  prayer.  Abdullah b. Umar reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw  spittle on the wall towards Qibla, and scratched it away and then turning to the people  said: When any one of you prays, he must not spit in front of him, for Allah is in front of  him when he is engaged in prayer.

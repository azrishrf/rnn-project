10|3864|  Chapter: The selling of the camel and stipulation of riding on it.  Fadila b. ‘Ubaid (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I bought on the day (of the Victory  of Khaibar) a necklace for twelve dinars (gold coins). It was made of gold studded with  gems. I separated (gold from gems) in it, and found (gold) of more (worth) than twelve  dinars. I made a mention of it to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon  he said: It should not be sold unless it is separated.

He said: Ahnaf, where do you intend to go? I said: I intend to  help the cousin of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), viz. ‘Ali. Thereupon he  said to me: Ahnaf, go back, for I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as  saying: When two Muslims confront one another with swords (in hands) both the slayer  and the slain would be in Fire. He (Ahnaf) said: I said, or it was said: Allah’s Messenger,  it may be the case of one who kills. but what about the slain (why he would be put in  Hell-Fire)? Thereupon he said: He also intended to kill his companion.

26|5456|  Chapter: The excellence of curing (with the help of incantation) the influence of the evil eye and  small pustules and the poison (especially of snake and scorpion).  Jabir reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) prohibited incantation. Then  the people of Amr b. Hazm came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and  said: We know an incantation which we use for curing the sting of the scorpion but you  have prohibited it. They recited (the words of incantation) before him, whereupon he         said: I do not see any harm (in it), so he who amongst you is competent to do good to  his brother should do that.

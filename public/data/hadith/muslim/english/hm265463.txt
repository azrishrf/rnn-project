26|5463|  Chapter: Seeking refuge against satan from the evil promptings in prayer.         Uthman b. Abu al-‘As reported that he came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) and said: Allah’s Messenger, the Satan intervenes between me and my prayer and  my reciting of the Qur’an and he confounds me. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said:, That is (the doing of the Satan) who is known as Khinzab,  and when you perceive its effect, seek refuge with Allah from it and spit three times to  your left. I did that and Allah dispelled that from me.

41|6961|  Chapter: The Last Hour would not come until a person would pass by a grave and wish that he  should have been the occupant of that grave because of this calamity.  Abu Nadra reported: “We were in the company of Jabir b. ‘Abdulldh that he said it may  happen that the people of Iraq may not send their qafiz and dirhams (their measures of  food stuff and their money). We said: Who would be responsible for it? He said: The  non-Arabs would prevent them. He again said: There is the possibility that the people of  Syria may not send their dinar and mudd. We said: Who would be responsible for it? He  said This prevention would be made by the Romans. He (Jabir b. Abdullab) kept quiet  for a while and then reported Allah’s Messenger (may peas be upon him) having said  There would be a caliph in the last(period) of my Ummah who would freely give  handfuls of wealth to the people without counting it. I said to Abu Nadra and Abu al-‘Ala:  DO you mean ‘Umarb. ‘Abd al-Aziz? They said: No (he would be Imam Mahdi.).

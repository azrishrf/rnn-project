18|4278|  Chapter: Stray thing found by anyone.         Zaid b. Khalid al-Juhani reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was  asked about picking up of stray things, whereupon he said: Make announcement of that  for one year, but if it is not recognised (by the owner), then recognise its big and strap,  then eat it; and if its owner comes, then give that to him. This hadith has been narrated  on the authority of Al-Dahhak b. Uthman with the same chain of transmitters but with a  slight variation of words.

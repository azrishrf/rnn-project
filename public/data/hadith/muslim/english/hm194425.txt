19|4425|  Chapter: The persecution of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) at the hands of the  infidels and hypocrites.  It has been narrated on the authority of ‘Aisha, the wife of the Prophet (may peace be  upon him), who said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him): Messenger of  Allah, has there come upon you a day more terrible than the day of Ubud. He said: I  have experienced from thy people and the hardest treatment I met from them was what  I received from them on the day of ‘Aqaba. I betook myself to Ibn Abd Yalil b. Abd Kulal  with the purpose of inviting him to Islam, but he did not respond to me as I desired. So I  departed with signs of (deep) distress on my face. I did not recover until I reached Qarn         al-Tha’alib. Where I raised my head, lo! near me was a cloud which had cast its shadow  on me. I looked and Lo! there was in it the angel Jibril who called out to me and said:  God. the Honoured and Glorious, has heard what thy people have said to thee, and how  they have reacted to thy call. And He has sent to thee the angel in charge of the  mountains so that thou mayest order him what thou wishest (him to do) with, regard to  them. The angel in charge of the mountains (then) called out to me, greeted me and  said: Muhammad, God has listened to what thy people have said to thee. I am the angel  in charge of the mountains and thy Lord has sent me to thee so that thou mayest order  me what thou wishest. If thou wishest that I should bring together the two mountains  that stand opposite to each other at the extremities of Mecca to crush them in between,  (I would do that). But the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said to him: I  rather hope that God will produce from their descendants such persons as will worship  Allah, the One, and will not ascribe partners to Him.

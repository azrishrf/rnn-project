25|5340|  Chapter: The Excellence of Tahnik of the new-born child at the time of its birth and of carrying it  to a pious person so that he may soften some dates and rub its palate with them, and  permissibility of giving name on the day of its birth and the excellence of such names as  ‘Abdullah, Ibrahim and the names of all the apostles of Allah (may peace be upon him).  Anas b. Malik reported: I took ‘Abdullah b. Abi Talha Ansari to Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) at the time of his birth. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) was at that time wearing a woollen cloak and besmearing the camels with tar. He  said: Have you got with you the dates? I said: Yes. He took hold of the dates and put  them in his mouth and softened them, then opened the mouth of the infant and put that  in it and the child began to lick it. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) said: The Ansar have a liking for the dates, and he (the Holy Prophet) gave him the  name of ‘Abdullah.

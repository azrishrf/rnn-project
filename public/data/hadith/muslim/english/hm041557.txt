4|1557|  Chapter: Excellence of observing two Rak’ahs in the mosque for one who comes back from a  journey.  Abu Dharr reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: In the morning  charity is due from every bone in the body of every one of you. Every utterance of  Allah’s glorification is an act of charity. Every utterance of praise of Him is an act of  charity, every utterance of profession of His Oneness is an act of charity, every         utterance of profession of His Greatness is an act of charity, enjoining good is an act of  charity, forbidding what is disreputable is an act of charity, and two rak’ahs which one  prays in the forenoon will suffice.

1|190|  Chapter: Serious prohibition of tale-carrying.  It is reported on the authority of Hammam b, al-Harith that a man used to carry tales to  the governor. We were sitting in the mosque, the people said: He is one who carries  tales to the governor. He (the narrator) said: Then he came and sat with us. Thereupon  Hudhaifa remarked: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saying:  The beater of false tales would never enter heaven.

4|1987|  Chapter: Mention of the torment of grave in eclipse prayer.  Abu Mas’ud al-Ansari reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  Verily the sun and the moon are the two signs among the signs of Allah by which He  frightens his servants and they do not eclipse on account of the death of any one of the  people. So when you see anything about them, observe prayer, supplicate Allah till it is  cleared from you.

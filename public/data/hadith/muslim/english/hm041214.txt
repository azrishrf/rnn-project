4|1214|  Chapter: Dhikr after the prayer.  ‘Aisha reported: There came to me two old women from the old Jewesses of Medina  and said: The people of the grave are tormented in their graves. I contradicted them and  I did not deem it proper to testify them. They went away and the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) came to me and I said to him: Messenger of Allah I there  came to me two old women from the old Jewesses of Medina and asserted that the  people of the graves would be tormented therein. He (the Prophet) said: They told the  truth; they would be tormented (so much) that the animals would listen to it. She (‘Aisha)  said: Never did I see him (the Holy Prophet) afterwards but seeking refuge from the  torment of the grave in prayer.

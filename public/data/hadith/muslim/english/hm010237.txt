1|237|  Chapter: Whenever a person intends to do a good deed, it is recorded, but whenever  he intends to commit evil, it is not written.  It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) transmitted it from the Blessed and Great Lord: Verily Allah recorded the  good and the evil and then made it clear that he who intended good but did not do it,  Allah recorded one complete good in his favour, but if he intended it and also did it, the  Glorious and Great Allah recorded ten to seven hundred virtues and even more to his  credit. But it he intended evil, but did not commit it, Allah wrote down full one good in his  favour. If he intended that and also committed it, Allah made an entry of one evil against  him.  Ã‚

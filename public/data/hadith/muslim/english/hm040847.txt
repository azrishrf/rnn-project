4|847|  Chapter: The Imam is authorised to appoint one as his deputy when there is a valid reason for  it (for example, illness or journey or any other), and if an Imam leads the prayer sitting as he  cannot do so standing, his followers should say prayer standing provided they are able to do it  and there is an abrogation of saying prayer sitting behind a sitting Imam.  Sahl b. Sa’d al-Sa’idi reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) went to  Bani Amr b. ‘Auf in order to bring about reconciliation amongst them. The rest of the  Hadith is the same but with (the addition of these words): “The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) came and made his way through the rows till he came to the first  row and Abu Bakr retraced his steps.”

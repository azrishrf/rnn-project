4|1907|  Chapter: Hadith pertaining to giving instruction in Kbutba.  Nu’man b. Bashir reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used  to recite on two ‘Ids and in Friday prayer: “Glorify The name of Thy Lord, the Most High”  (Surah lxxxvii.), and: “Has there come to thee the news of the overwhelming event”  (lxxxviii.). And when the ‘Id and Jumu’a combined on a day he recited these two (surah)  in both the prayers.

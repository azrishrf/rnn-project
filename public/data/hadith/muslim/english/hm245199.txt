Yasar, the freed slave of  Nafi’ b. ‘Abd al-Harith, while I was sitting between them, that he should ask Ibn ‘Umar if  he had heard anything from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) pertaining to  one who trails his lower garment out of pride. He said: I heard him (the Holy Prophet) as  saying: Allah will not look toward him on the Day of Resurrection.

31|6065|  Chapter: The merits of Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him).  Anas reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to me as I was  playing with playmates. He greeted and sent me on an errand and I made delay in  going to my mother. When I came to her she said: What detained you? I said: Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent me on an errand. She said: What was the  purpose? I said: It is something secret. Thereupon she said: Do not then divulge the  secret of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to anyone. Anas said: By Allah, if  I were to divulge it to anyone, then, O Thabit, I would have divulged it to you.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

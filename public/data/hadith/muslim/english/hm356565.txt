35|6565|  Chapter: Refuge from the evil of what one has done, and what one has not done.  Abu Huraira reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to  supplicate (in these words):”O Allah, set right for me my religion which is the safeguard  of my affairs. And set right for me the affairs of my world wherein is my living. And set  right for me my Hereafter on which depends my after-life. And make the life for me (a         source) of abundance for every good and make my death a source of comfort for me  protecting me against every evil.”  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

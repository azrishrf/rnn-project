25|5329|  Chapter: Disapproval of giving ugly names and such names as can be treated as ill omens.  Samura b. Jundub reprted: The dearest words to Allah are four: Subhan Allah  (Hallowed be Allah), Al-Hamdulillah (Praise be to Allah), Wa la ilaha illa-Allah (There is  no god but Allah), Allah-O-Akbar (God is the Greatest). There is no harm for you in  which order you begin (them while remembering Allah), and he also said: Do not give  these names to your servants, Yasar and Rabah and Nafi and Najth.

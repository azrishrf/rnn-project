4|1161|  Chapter: It is forbidden to cry out for finding out the lost thing in the mosque.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When  there is a call to prayer the devil runs back breaking the wind so that he may not hear  the call, and when the call is complete he comes back. And when the takbir is  pronounced he again runs back, and when takbir is over he comes back and distracts a  man saying: Remember such and such, remember such and such, referring to  something the man did not have in his mind, with the result that he does not know how  much he has prayed; so when any one of you is not sure how much he has prayed, he  should perform two prostrations while sitting (qaâ€™da).

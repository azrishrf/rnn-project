3|715|  Chapter: Tayammum.  ‘Aisha reported she had borrowed from Asma’ (her sister) a necklace and it was lost.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent men to search for it. As it was  the time for prayer, they offered prayer without ablution (as water was not available  there). When they came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), they  made a complaint about it, and the verses pertaining to tayammum were revealed.  Upon this Usaid b. Hadair said (to ‘Aisha): May Allah grant you a good reward! Never  has been there an occasion when you were beset with difficulty and Allah did not make  you come out of that and made it an occasion of blessing for the Muslims.

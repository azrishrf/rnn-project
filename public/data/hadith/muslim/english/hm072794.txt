7|2794|  Chapter: Types of Ihram- It is permissible to enter into the state of Ihram singularly for  the sake of Hajj or for tamattu’ bi’l-‘umra ila’l-Hajj or for both hajj and ‘umra together.  Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said.: We went with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) in ‘a state of Ihram for the Hajj. There were women and children with us.  When we reached Mecca we circumambulated the House and (ran) between al-Safa  and al-Marwa. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who has no  sacrificial animal with him should put off ihram. We said: What kind of putting off? He  said: Getting out of ihram completely. So we came to our wives, and put on our clothes  and applied perfume. When it was the day of Tarwiya, we put on Ihram for Hajj and the  first circumambulation and (running) between al-Safa and al-Marwa sufficed us...  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded us to become seven partners  (in the sacrifice) of a camel and a cow.

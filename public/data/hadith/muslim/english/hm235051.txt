23|5051|  Chapter: What should the guest do if an uninvited person accompanies him and the merit of  inviting that person to feast.  Abu Mas’ud Ansari reported that a person from the Ansar who was called Abu Shu’aib  had a slave who was a butcher (by profession). He (Abu Mas’ud) saw Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) and found signs of hunger on his face. He said to  the servant: 0 ye, prepare for us food sufficient for five persons, for I intend to invite  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) who would be the fifth amongst the five. He  (the narrator) reported that he then prepared the food and came to Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) and invited all the five (including him) who was the fifth amongst  them to the feast. A man followed him and when Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) reached the door, he said: This man has followed us; if you like you may permit  him (to join the meal) and if you like he can go back. Thereupon the person said: Allah’s  Messenger, I permit him.

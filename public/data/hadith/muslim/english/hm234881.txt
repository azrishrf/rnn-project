23|4881|  Chapter: Forbiddance of wine.  Husain b. ‘Ali reported ‘Ali having said: There fell to my lot a she-camel out of the spoils  of war on the Day of Badr, and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave me  (another) she-camel on that day out of the Khums (one-fifth reserved for Allah and His  Messenger). When I made up my mind to consummate my marriage with Fatima, the  daughter of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), I prevailed upon a goldsmith  of the tribe of Qainuqa’ to go along with me so that we might bring Idhkhir wishing to sell         that to the goldsmiths and thus I should be able to arrange my wedding feast. While I  was arranging the equipments. i.e. litters, sacks and ropes, my two she-camels were  sitting down at the side of the apartment of a person of the Ansar. I collected (the  different articles of equipment) and found to my surprise that their humps had been  chopped off and their haunches had been cut off and their livers had been taken out. I  could not help weeping when I saw that plight of theirs. I said: Who has done that? They  said: Hamza b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib has done this and he is in this house dead drunk in the  company of some of the Ansair with a singing girl singing before him and his  companions. She said in her song: O Hamza, get up and attack these faulty she- camels. Thereupon Hamza stood up with a sword (in his hand) and cut off their humps  and ripped their haunches and tore out their livers. ‘Ali said: I went away until I came to  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was with him Zaid b. Haritha.  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) recognised from my face what I had  experienced, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What has  happened to you? I said: Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I have never seen (such an  unfortunate day) as this day. Hamza has committed aggression to my she-camels, and  has cut off their humps and ripped their haunches, and he is in a house in the company  of some drunkards. (Hearing this) Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent for  his mantle and, putting it on him, he proceeded, and I and Zaid b. Haritha followed him,  until he came to the door (of the house) in which there was Hamza. He (the Holy  Prophet) sought permission which they granted him and they were all drunk. Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to reprimand Hamza for what he had done.  Hamza’s eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) and then looked towards his knees and then lifted his eyes and cast a glance at his  waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then Hamza said: Are you anything  but the slaves of my father? Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to know  that he was intoxicated, and he thus turned upon his heels, and came out, and we also  came out along with him.

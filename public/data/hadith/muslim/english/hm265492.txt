26|5492|  Chapter: Remedy with help of honey.  Abu Sa’id Khudri reported that a person came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) and told him that his brother’s bowels were loose. There upon Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) said: Give him honey. So he gave him that and then came  and said: I gave him honey but it has only made his bowels more loose. He said this  three times; and then he came the fourth time, and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Give him  honey. He said: I did give him, but it has only made his bowels more loose, whereupon  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah has spoken the truth and your  brother’s bowels are in the wrong. So he made him drink (honey) and he was  recovered. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Sa’id Khudri through  another chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.

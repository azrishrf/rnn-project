29|5618|  Chapter: Not known.  Abu Qatada reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The good  vision are from Allah and the evil dreams are from the satan. If one sees a dream which  one does not like, one should spit on one’s left side and seek the refuge of Allah from  the satan; it will not do one any harm, and one should not disclose it to anyone and if  one sees a good vision one should feel pleased but should not disclose it to anyone but  whom one loves.

24|5266|  Chapter: Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.  ‘Aisha reported that she bought a carpet which had pictures on it. When Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw that, he stayed at the door and did not get in.  I perceived or I was made to perceive upon his face signs of disgust. She said: Allah’s  Messenger, I offer repentance to Allah and His Messenger, (but tell me) what is the sin  that I have committed. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:  What is this carpet? She said: I bought it for you so that you might sit on it and take rest.  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The owners of these  pictures would be tormented and they would be asked to bring to life what they tried to  create. He then said: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture.

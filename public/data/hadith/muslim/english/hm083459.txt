8|3459|  Chapter: Excellence of marrying a virgin.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: I married a woman, whereupon  Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) said to me: Have you married? I said: Yes.  He said: Is it a virgin or a previously married one (widow or divorced)? I said: With a  previously married one, whereupon he said: Where had you been (away) from the  amusements of virgins? Shu’ba said: I made a mention of it to ‘Amr b. Dinar and he  said: I too heard from Jabir making mention of that (that Allah’s Apostle) said: Why  didn’t you marry a girl, so that you might sport with her and she might sport with you?

35|6551|  Chapter: Supplication at the time of sleeping and going to bed.  Suhail reported that Abu Salih used to command us (in these words): When any one of  you intends to go to sleep, he should lie on the bed on his right side and then say: “O  Allah. the Lord of the Heavens and the Lord of the Earth and Lord of the Magnificent  Throne, our Lord, and the Lord of everything, the Splitter of the grain of corn and the  date-stone (or fruit kernal), the Revealer of Torah and Injil (Bible) and Criterion (the Holy  Qur’an), I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of everything Thou art to seize by the  forelock (Thou hast perfect control over it). O Allah, Thou art the First, there is naught  before Thee, and Thou art the Last and there is naught after Thee, and Thou art Evident  and there is nothing above Thee, and Thou art Innermost and there is nothing beyond  Thee. Remove the burden of debt from us and relieve us from want.” Abu Salih used to  narrate it from Abu Huraira who narrated it from Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him).

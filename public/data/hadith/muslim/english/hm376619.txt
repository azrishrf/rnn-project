37|6619|  Chapter: Exhortation for repentance.  Anas b. Malik reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah is  more pleased with the repentance of His servant than if one of you gets up and he finds  his camel missing in a waterless desert (and then he accidentally finds it). This hadith  has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik through another chain of  transmitters.

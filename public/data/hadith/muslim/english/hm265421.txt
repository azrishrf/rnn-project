26|5421|  Chapter: It is prohibited for two persons to converse secretly without the consent of the third  one.  ‘Abdullah reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If you are  three, two amongst you should not converse secretly between yourselves to the  exclusion of the other (third one), unti some other people join him (and dispel his  loneliness), for it may hurt his feelings.

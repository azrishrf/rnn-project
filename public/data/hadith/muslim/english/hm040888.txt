4|888|  Chapter: The praying women have been commanded not to precede men in lifting their heads  from prostration.         Ibn ‘Umar reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do not  prevent women from going to the mosque at night. A boy said to ‘Abdullah b. Umar: We  would never let them go out, that they may not be caught in evil. He (the narrator) said:  Ibn Umar reprimanded him and said: I am saying that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said this, but you say: We would not allow !

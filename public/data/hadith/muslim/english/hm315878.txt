31|5878|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Bakr Siddiq (Allah be pleased with him).  Muhammad b. Jubair b. Mut’im reported on the authority of his father that a woman  asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about something but lit, told her to  come to him on some other occasion, whereupon she said: What in your opinion         (should I do) if I come to you but do not find you, and it seemed as if she meant that he  might die. Thereupon he said: If you do not find me, then come to Abu Bakr.  This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Jubair b. Mut’im through another chain  of transmitters (and the words are) that a woman came to Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) and discussed with him something and he gave a command as we  find in the above-mentioned narration.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

19|4354|  Chapter: The saying of the Prophet (may peace be upon him): “We (Prophets) do not  have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity”.  It has been narrated by ‘Urwa b Zubair on the authority of ‘Aisha, wife of the Holy  Prophet (may peace be upon him), that Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him), requested Abu Bakr, after the death of the Messenger of  Allah (may peace he upon him), that he should set apart her share from what the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had left from the properties that God had  bestowed upon him. Abu Bakr said to her: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) said: “We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is Sadaqa (charity).” The  narrator said: She (Fatima) lived six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) and she used to demand from Abu Bakr her share from the  legacy of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from Khaibar, Fadak and his  charitable endowments at Medina. Abu Bakr refused to give her this, and said: I am not  going to give up doing anything which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  used to do. I am afraid that it I go against his instructions in any matter I shall deviate  from the right course. So far as the charitable endowments at Medina were concerned,  ‘Umar handed them over to ‘All and Abbas, but ‘Ali got the better of him (and kept the  property under his exclusive possession). And as far as Khaibar and Fadak were  concerned ‘Umar kept them with him, and said: These are the endowments of the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (to the Umma). Their income was spent  on the discharge of the responsibilities that devolved upon him on the emergencies he  had to meet. And their management was to be in the hands of one who managed the  affairs (of the Islamic State). The narrator said: They have been managed as such up to  this day.

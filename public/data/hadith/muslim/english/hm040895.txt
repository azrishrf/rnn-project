4|895|  Chapter: The praying women have been commanded not to precede men in lifting their heads  from prostration.  ‘Amra, daughter of Abd al-Rahmin, reported: I heard ‘Aisha, the wife of the Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him), say: If the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) had seen what new things the women have introduced (in their way of life) he  would have definitely prevented them from going to the mosque, as the women of Bani  Isra’il were prevented.

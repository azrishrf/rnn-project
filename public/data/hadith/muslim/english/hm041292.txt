4|1292|  Chapter: Times of prayer.  Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The  Fire said to the Lord: O Lord! some parts of mine have consumed the others, so allow  me to exhale (in order to find some relief from this congestion). It was granted  permission to take two exhalations, one exhalation during the winter and the other  exhalation during the summer So whatever you perceive in the form of intense cold or  hurting cold is from the exhalation of Hell. And whatever you perceive in the form of  extreme heat or intense beat is from the exhalation of Hell.

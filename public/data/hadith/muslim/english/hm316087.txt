31|6087|  Chapter: The merits of the participants in the Battle of Badr (Allah be pleased with them) and  the story of Hatib b. Abu Balta’a.  Ubaidullah b. Rafi’, who was the scribe of ‘All, reported: I heard ‘Ali (Allah be pleased  with him) as saying: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent me and Zubair  and Miqdad saying: Go to the garden of, Khakh [it is a place between Medina and  Mecca at a distance of twelve miles from Medina] and there you will find a woman riding  a camel. She would be in possession of a letter, which you must get from her. So we  rushed on horses and when we met that woman, we asked her to deliver that letter to  us. She said: There is no letter with me. We said: Either bring out that letter or we would  take off your clothes. She brought out that letter from (the plaited hair of) her head. We  delivered that letter to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which Hatib b.  Abu Balta’a had informed some people amongst the polytheists of Mecca about the  affairs of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) said: Hatib, what is this? He said: Allah’s messenger, do not be hasty in  judging my intention. I was a person attached to the Quraish. Sufyan said: He was their  ally but had no relationship with them. (Hatib further said): Those who are with you  amongst the emigrants have blood-relationship with them (the Quraish) and thus they  would protect their families. I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with them I  should find some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not  done this because of any unbelief or apostasy and I have no liking for the unbelief after I  have (accepted) Islam. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: You  have told the truth. ‘Umar said: Allah’s Messenger, permit me to strike the neck of this         hypocrite. But he (the Holy Prophet) said: He was a participant in Badr and you little  know that Allah revealed about the people of Badr: Do what you like for there is  forgiveness for you. And Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: “O you who believe, do  not take My enemy and your enemy for friends” (lx. 1). And there is no mention of this  verse in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Bakr and Zubair and Ishaq has in  his narration made a mention of the recitation of this verse by Sufyan.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

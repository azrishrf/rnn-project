10|3643|  Chapter: It is invalid to sell the commodity before taking possession of it.  Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: He who buys food-grain should not sell it, until he has weighed it  (and then taken possession of it). I (Tawus) said to Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with  them): Why is it so? Thereupon he said: Don’t you see that they (the people) sell food- grains against gold for the stipulated time. Abu Kuraib did not make any mention of the  stipulated time.

10|3724|  Chapter: Leasing out land.  Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: We used to get land (on rent)  during the lifetime of Allah’s Messenger, (may peace be upon him) with a share of one- third or one-fourth (of the produce from the land irrigated) with the help of canals.         Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up (to address) and said:  He who has land should cultivate it, and if he does not cultivate it, he should lend it to  his brother, and if he does not lend it to his brother, he should then retain it.

19|4471|  Chapter: The expedition called Dhat-ur-Riqa.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Musa (Ash’ari) who said: We set out on an  expedition with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). We were six in  number and had (with us) only one camel which we rode turn by turn Our feet were  injured. My feet were so badly injured that my nails dropped off. We covered our feet  with rags, so this expedition was called Dhat-ur-Riqa’ (i.e. the expedition of rags)  because we bandaged our feet with rags (on that day). Abu Burda said: Abu Musa  narrated this tradition, and then disliked repeating it as he did not want to give any  publicity to what he did in a noble cause Abu Usama said: Narrators other than Abu  Buraida have added to the version of the words: “God will reward it.”

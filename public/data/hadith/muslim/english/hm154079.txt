15|4079|  Chapter: How should the masters treat their slaves and expiation if they show high- handedness.  Zadhan reported that Ibn Umar called his slave and he found the marks (of beating)  upon his back. He said to him: I have caused you pain. He said: No. But he (Ibn Umar)  said: You are free. He then took hold of something from the earth and said: There is no  reward for me even to the weight equal to it. I heard Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: He who beats a slave without cognisable offence of his or slaps  him (without any serious fault), then expiation for it is that he should set him free.

9|3597|  Chapter: It is forbidden to sell Al-Wala’ (the right of inheritance of a slave) and its  conferring on others.  This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with  them) through another chain of transmitters but with this change that in the hadith  narrated by al-Thaqafi from Ubaidullah there is only a mention of selling (or right of  inheritance, al-Wala’) but not that of making a gift.

3|674|  Chapter: Emission of semen makes bath obligatory.  Sa’id al-Khudri narrated it from his father: I went to Quba’ with the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) on Monday till we reached (the habitation) of Banu Salim. The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood at the door of ‘Itban and called him  loudly. So he came out dragging his lower garment. Upon this the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: We have made this man to make haste ‘Itban said:  Messenger of Allah, if a man parts with his wife suddenly without seminal emission,  what is he required to do (with regard to bath)? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: It is with the seminal emission that bath becomes obligatory.

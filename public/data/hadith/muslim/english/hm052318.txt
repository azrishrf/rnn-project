5|2318|  Chapter: Exhortation to kill the Khwarij.  Abu Said Khudri reported that ‘Ali (Allah be pleased with him) sent some gold alloyed  with dust to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) distributed that among four men, al-Aqra b. Habis  Hanzali and Uyaina b. Badr al-Fazari and ‘Alqama b. ‘Ulatha al-‘Amiri, then to one  person of the tribe of Kilab and to Zaid al-Khair al-Ta’l, and then to one person of the  tribe of Nabhan. Upon this the people of Quraish felt angry and said: He (the Holy  Prophet) gave to the chiefs of Najd and ignored us. Upon this the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: I have done it with a view to conciliating them. Then  there came a person with thick beard, prominent cheeks, deep sunken eyes and  protruding forehead and shaven head. He said: Muhammad, fear Allah. Upon this the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: If I disobey Allah, who would then  obey Him? Have I not been (sent as the) most trustworthy among the people of the- world?-but you do not repose trust in me. That person then went back. A person among  the people then sought permission (from the Holy Prophet) for his murder. According to  some, it was Khalid b. Walid who sought the permission. Upon this the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him),said: From this very person’s posterity there would arise         people who would recite the Qur’an, but it would not go beyond their throat; they would  kill the followers of Islam and would spare the idol-worshippers. They would glance  through the teachings of Islam so hurriedly just as the arrow passes through the pray. If  I were to ever find them I would kill them like ‘Ad.

23|5105|  Chapter: Showing honour to the guest and the merit of making of sacrifice for him.  ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr reported: We were one hundred and thirty (persons) with  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him). Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  said: Does any one of You possess food? There was a person with (us) who had a sa’  of flour or something about that, and it was kneaded. Then a tall polytheist with  dishevelled hair came driving his flock of sheep. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him) said: Would you like to sell it (any one of these goats) or offer it as a gift or  a present? He said: No, (I am not prepared to offer as a gift), but I would sell it. He (the  Holy Prophet) bought a sheep from him, and it was slaughtered and its meat was  prepared, and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded that its liver  should be roasted. He (the narrator) said: By Allah, none among one hundred and thirty  persons was left whom Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had not given a  part out of her liver; if anyone was present he gave it to him, but if he was absent it was  set aside for him. And he (the Holy Prophet) filled two bowls (one with soup and the  other with mutton) and we all ate out of them to our hearts’ content, but (still) some part  was (left) in (those) two bowls, and I placed it on the camel-(or words to the same  effect).

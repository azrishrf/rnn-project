2|475|  Chapter: Purging of sins with ablution water.         Abu Huraira reported: Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: When a  bondsman-a Muslim or a believer-washes his face (in course of ablution), every sin he  contemplated with his eyes will be washed away from his face along with water, or with  the last drop of water; when he washes his hands, every sin they wrought will be  effaced from his hands with the water, or with the last drop of water; and when he  washes his feet, every sin towards which his feet have walked will be washed away with  the water or with the last drop of water with the result that he comes out pure from all  sins.

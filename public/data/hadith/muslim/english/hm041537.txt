4|1537|  Chapter: Excellence to be on the right side of the Imam.  ‘Abdullah b.

He observed two rak’ahs  in a corner of the mosque, and then joined the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) in prayer. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had pronounced  salutations (he had concluded the prayer), he said: O, so and so, which one out of these  two prayers did you count (as your Fard prayer), the one that you observed alone or the  prayer that you observed with us?

23|5120|  Chapter: A believer eats in one intestine whereas a non-believer eats in seven  intestines.  Abu Huraira reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) invited a non- Muslim. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded that a goat be milked  for him. It was milked and he drank its milk. Then the second one was milked and he  drank its milk, and then the other one was milked and he drank its milk till he drank the  milk of seven goats. On the next morning he embraced Islam. And Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) commanded that a goat should be milked for him and he  drank its milk and then another was milked but he did not finish it, whereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: A believer drinks In one intestine whereas a  non-believer drinks in seven intestines.

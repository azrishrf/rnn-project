7|3202|  Chapter: When people will abandon Medina.  Salid b. Musayyib heard Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) say that ‘Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said about Medina: Its inhabitants will abandon it,  whereas it is good for them and it will become the haunt of beasts and birds. (Imam  Muslim said that Abu Safwan, one of the narrators whose name was ‘Abdullah b. ‘Abd  al-Malik, was an orphan and Ibn Juraij took him under his care for ten years.)

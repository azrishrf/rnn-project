1|383|  Chapter: Pertaining to the words of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him): “I  would be the first among people to Intercede in the Paradise and among the Apostles I  would have the largest following”.  Anas b. Malik said: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I would be the  first intercessor in the Paradise and no apostle amongst the apostles has been testified  (by such a large number of people) as I have been testified. And verily there would be  an apostle among the apostles who would be testified to by only one man from his  people.

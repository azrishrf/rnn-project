4|1302|  Chapter: Desirability of observing the noon prayer at the earlier hour (of times prescribed for it)  when there is no intense heat.  Abu Umama b. Sahl reported: We offered the noon prayer with Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz.  We then set out till we came to Anas b. Malik and found him busy in saying the  afternoon prayer. I said to him: O uncle! which is this prayer that you are offering? He  said: It is the afternoon prayer and this is the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) that we offered along with him.

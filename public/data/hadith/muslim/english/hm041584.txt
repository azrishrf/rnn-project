4|1584|  Chapter: The virtue of Sunan prayers before and after the Fard Rak’ahs and their number.  ‘Abdullah b. Shaqiq said: I asked ‘Aisha about the Messenger of Allah’s (may peace be  upon him) voluntary prayers, and she replied: Before the noon prayer, he used to pray  four rak’ahs in my house; then would go out and lead the people in prayer; then come in  and pray two rak’ahs. He would then lead the people in the sunset prayer; then come in  and pray two rak’ahs. Then he would lead the people in the ‘Isha prayer, and enter my  house and pray two rak’ahs. He would pray nine rak’ahs during the night, including Witr.  At night he would pray for a long time standing and for a long time sitting, and when he  recited the Holy Qur’an while standing, he would bow and prostrate himself from the  standing position, and when he recited while sitting, he would bow and prostrate himself  from the sitting position, and when it was dawn he would pray two rak’ahs.

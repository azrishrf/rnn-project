31|6170|  Chapter: The merits of Uwais Qarani (Allah be pleased with him).  Usair b. Jabir reported that a delegation from Kufa came to ‘Umar and there was a  person amongst them who jeered at Uwais. Thereupon Umar said: Is there amongst us  one from Qaran? That person came and Umar said: Verily Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) has said: There would come to you a person from Yemen who  would be called Uwais and he would leave none in Yemen (behind him) except his  mother, and he would have the whiteness (due to leprosy) and he supplicated Allah and  it was cured except for the size of a dinar or dirham. He who amongst you meets him  should ask him to supplicate for forgiveness (from Allah) for you.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

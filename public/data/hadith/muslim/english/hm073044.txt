7|3044|  Chapter: It is meritorious for one who does intend to go himself to send the sacrificial  animal to al-Haram.  Masruq reported: I heard ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) clapping her hands behind  the curtain and saying: I used to weave garlands for the sacrificial animals of Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) with my own hands, and then he (the Holy  Prophet) sent them (to Mecca), and he did not avoid doing anything which a Muhrin  avoids until his animal was sacrificed.

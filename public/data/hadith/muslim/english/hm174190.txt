17|4190|  Chapter: Prohibition of intercession regarding prescribed punishment for theft and other  (crimes) in case of important persons.  Jaibir reported that a woman from the tribe of Makhzum committed theft. She was  brought to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and she sought refuge  (intercession) from Umm Salama, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: By Allah, even if she were  Fatima, I would have her hand cut off. And thus her hand was cut off.

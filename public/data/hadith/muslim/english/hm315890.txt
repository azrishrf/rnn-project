31|5890|  Chapter: The excellent qualities of ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: While I  was asleep I saw myself on a well with a leathern bucket on a pulley. I drew (water) out  of that as Allah wished me (to draw). Then the son of Abu Quhafa (Abu Bakr) drew from  it one bucketful or two and there was some weakness in drawing that (may Allah forgive  him). Then that bucket (changed into a large bucket) and Ibn Khattab drew it. I did not  see any strongest man drawing it like ‘Umar b. Khattab. He brought out so much water  that the camels of the people had enough to drink and then laid down (for rest).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

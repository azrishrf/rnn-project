1|171|  Chapter: He who dies associating none with Allah would enter Paradise and he who  dies as a polytheist would enter the fire of Hell.  I heard Abu Dharr narrating it from the Apostle (may peace be upon him) that he  observed: Gabriel came to me and gave me the tidings: Verily he who died amongst  your Ummah without associating anything with Allah would enter Paradise. I (the  narrator) said: Even if he committed adultery and theft. He (the Holy Prophet) said:  (Yes), even if he committed adultery and theft.

1|153|  Chapter: Belief in Allah is the best of deeds.  It was heard from Abu ‘Amr Shaibani that, pointing towards the house of Abdullah, he  said: The owner of this house told me that he asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him): Which of the deeds are liked by Allah? He (the Holy Prophet) observed:  Prayer at its proper time. I (again) said: What next? He replied: Then goodness to the  parents. I (again) said: What then? He replied: Then Jihad in the cause of Allah. He  (‘Abdullah) said: This is what I was told (by the Holy Prophet). Had I questioned further,  he would have made additions for me.

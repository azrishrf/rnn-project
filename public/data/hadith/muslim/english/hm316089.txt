31|6089|  Chapter: The merits of the participants in the Battle of Badr (Allah be pleased with them) and  the story of Hatib b. Abu Balta’a.  Jabir reported that a slave of Hatib came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) complaining against Hatib and said: Hatib will definitely go to Hell. (But) Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: You tell a lie; he would not get into that for  he had taken part in Badr and in (the expedition of) Hudaibiya.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

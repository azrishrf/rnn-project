Umayya (Allah be pleased with him) reported that a person came to the Apostle  of Allah (may peace be upon him) as he was staying at Ji’rana and he had put on Ihram  for ‘Umra and he had dyed his beard and his head with yellow colour and there was a  cloak on him. He said: I put on Ihram for ‘Umra and I am in this state as you see (with  dyed beard and head and a cloak over me). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take off the  cloak and wash the yellowness and do in your ‘Umra what you do in Hajj.

9|3526|  Chapter: There is no maintenance allowance for one who has been given irrevocable  divorce.  Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported that her husband divorced her  with three, pronouncements and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made no  provision for her lodging and maintenance allowance. She (further said): Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: When your period of ‘Idda is over,  inform me. So I informed him. (By that time) Mu’awiya, Abu Jahm and Usama b. Zaid  had given her the proposal of marriage. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  said: So far as Mu’awiya is concerned, he is a poor man without any property. So far as  Abu Jahm is concerned, he is a great beater of women, but Usama b. Zaid... She  pointed with her hand (that she did not approve of the idea of marrying) Usama. But  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Obedience to Allah and obedience to  His Messenger is better for thee. She said: So I married him, and I became an object of  envy.

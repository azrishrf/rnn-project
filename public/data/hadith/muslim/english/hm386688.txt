38|6688|  Chapter: Not known.  Qais reported: I said to ‘Ammar: What is your opinion about that which you have done in  case (of your siding with Hadrat ‘Ali)? Is it your personal opinion or something you got  from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? ‘Ammar said: We have got nothing  from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which people at large did not get, but  Hudhaifa told me that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had especially told him  amongst his Companion, that there would be twelve hypocrites out of whom eight would  not get into Paradise, until a camel would be able to pass through the needle hole. The  ulcer would be itself sufficient (to kill) eight. So far as four are concerned, I do not  remember what Shu’ba said about them.         COMMAND CONCERNING THEM

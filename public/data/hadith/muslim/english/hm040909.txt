4|909|  Chapter: Recitation of the Qur’an loudly in the dawn prayer.  Abu Qatada reported it on the authority of his father: The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) would recite in the first two rak’ahs of the noon and afternoon  prayers the opening chapter of the Book and another surah. He would sometimes recite  loud enough to make audible to us the verse and would recite in the last two rak’ahs  Surat al-Faitiha (only).

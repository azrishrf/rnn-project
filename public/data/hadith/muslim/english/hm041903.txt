4|1903|  Chapter: Shortness of prayer and surmon.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: Sulaik Ghatafani came on Friday when the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) was delivering the sermon. He (Sulaik) sat down. He  (the Holy Prophet) said to him: O Sulaik I stand and observe two rak’ahs and make  them short, and then said: When any one of you comes on Friday, while the Imam  delivers the sermon, he should observe two rak’ahs and should make them short.

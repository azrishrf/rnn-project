7|2885|  Chapter: Excellence of performing Umra in the month of Ramadhan.         Ibn Abbas reported that Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to a woman of  the Ansar who was called Umm Sinan: What has prevented you that you did not  perform Hajj with us? She said: The father of so and so (i.e. her husband) had only two  camels. One of them had been taken away by him (my husband) and his son for Hajj,  whereas the other one is used by our boy to carry water. Upon this he (the Holy  Prophet) said: Umra during the month of Rawadin would suffice for Hajj or Hajj along  with me.

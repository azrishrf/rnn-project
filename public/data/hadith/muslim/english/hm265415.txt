26|5415|  Chapter: The entrance of the Eunuch (in a house where there are female inmates) is  prohibited.  Umm Salama reported that she had a eunuch (as a slave) in her house. Allah’s  Messenger imay peace be upon him) was once in the house that he (the eunuch) said  to the brother of Umm Salama: Abdullahb. Aba Umayya; if Allah grants you victory in  Ta’if on the next day, I will show you the daughter of Ghailan for she has four folds  (upon her body) on the front side of her stomach and eight folds on the back.

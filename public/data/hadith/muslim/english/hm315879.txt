31|5879|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Bakr Siddiq (Allah be pleased with him).  ‘Aisha reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in his (last) illness  asked me to call Abu Bakr, her father, and her brother too, so that he might write a  document, for he feared that someone else might be desirous (of succeeding him) and  that some claimant may say: I have better claim to it, whereas Allah and the Faithful do  not substantiate the claim of anyone but that of Abu Bakr.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

7|3164|  Chapter: Eminence of Medina, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) showered  blessings upon it. Its sacredness and unlawfulness of hunting and lopping of trees and  demarcation its precincts.  A Hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of A’mash with the same chain of  transmitters (but at the end) these words are added: “He who violated the covenant with  a Muslim, there is upon him the curse of Allah, of angels and of all people. Neither an  obligatory act nor a supererogatory act would be accepted from him as recompense on  the Day of Resurrection; and in the Hadith transmitted by two other narrators these  words are not found: “He who claimed false paternity.” And in the Hadith transmitted by  Waki’ there is no mention of the Day of Resurrection.

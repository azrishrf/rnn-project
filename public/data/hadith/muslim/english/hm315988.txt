31|5988|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her).  ‘Aisha reported: I heard that never a prophet dies until he is given an option to opt the  life of (this) world or that of the Hereafter. She further said: I heard Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) say in his last illness in which he’ died. I heard him saying in  gruffness of the voice: Along with those persons upon whom Allah bestowed favours  from amongst the Apostles, the testifiers of truth, the martyrs, the pious and goodly  company are they (iv. 69). (It was on bearing these words) that I thought that he had  been given choice (and he opted to live with these pious persons in the Paradise).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

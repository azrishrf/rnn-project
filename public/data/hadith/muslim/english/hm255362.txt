25|5362|  Chapter: Asking permission to enter a house.  This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Talha b. Yahya with the same chain of  transmitters but with this variation of wording: He (Hadrat ‘Umar) said: Abu Mundhir (the  Kunya of Ubayy b. Ka’b), did you hear this from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him)? Thereupon he said: Yes, and he further said: Ibn Khattab, do not be a torment for  the Companions of Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon him). No mention has,  however, been made of the words of ‘Umar: “Hallowed be Allah” and what follows  subsequently.

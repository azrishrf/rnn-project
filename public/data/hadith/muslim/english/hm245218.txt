24|5218|  Chapter: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got made for himself a signet  ring when he decided to write letters to the non-Arabs.  Anas reported that when Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) decided to write to  the Kisri (the King of Persia), Caesar (Emperor of Rome), and the Negus (the Emperor  of Abyssinia), it was said to him that they would not accept the letter without the seal  over it; so Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got a seal made, the ring of  which was made of silver and there was engraved on it. (Muhammad. the Messenger of  Allah).

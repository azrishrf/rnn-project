1|218|  Chapter: Would (people) be held responsible for the deeds committed during the state  of ignorance?.  It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Masâ€™ud: We once said: Messenger of Allah,  would we be held responsible for our deeds committed in the state of ignorance? He  (the Holy Prophet) observed: He who did good deeds in Islam would not be held  responsible for what he did in the state of ignorance, but he who committed evil (after  having come within the fold of Islam) would be held responsible for his previous and  later deeds.

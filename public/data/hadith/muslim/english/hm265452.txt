26|5452|  Chapter: The excellence of curing (with the help of incantation) the influence of the evil eye and  small pustules and the poison (especially of snake and scorpion).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) granted a  special sanction for incantation in case of the snake poison to a tribe of ‘Amr. Abu  Zubair said: I heard Jabir b. ‘Abdullah as saying that the scorpion stung one of us as we  were sitting with Allah’s Messenger (may peace upon him). A person said: Allah’s         Messenger, I use incantation (for curing the effect of sting), whereupon he said: He who  is competent amongst you to benefit his brother should do so.

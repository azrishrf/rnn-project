4|1303|  Chapter: Desirability of observing the noon prayer at the earlier hour (of times prescribed for it)  when there is no intense heat.  Anas b. Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led us in the  afternoon prayer. When he completed it, a person from Bani Salama came to him and  said: Messenger of Allah, we intend to slaughter our came and we are desirous that you  should also be present there (on this occasion). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. He  (the person) went and we also went along with him and we found that the camel had not  been slaughtered yet. Then it was slaughtered, and it was cut into pieces and then  some of those were cooked, and then we ate (them) before the setting of the sun. This  Hadith has also been narrated by another chain of transmitters.

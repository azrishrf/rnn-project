10|3858|  Chapter: He (the Holy Prophet) cursed the one who accepts interest and the one who pays it.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Let dinar be exchanged for dinar, with no addition on either side  and dirham be exchanged for dirham with no addition on either side. This hadith has  been narrated on the authority of Musa b. Abu Tamim with the same chain of  transmitters.

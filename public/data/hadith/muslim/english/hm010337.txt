1|337|  Chapter: The meaning of the words of Allah: “He saw Him in another descent” (Al- Qur’an 2, liii. 13).Did the Apostle (may peace be upon him) see his Lord on the night of  his journey (to Heaven) ?.  It is narrated on the authority of Masruq that he said: I was resting at (the house of)  ‘Aisha that she said: O Abu ‘Aisha (kunya of Masruq), there are three things, and he  who affirmed even one of them fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I asked that  they were. She said: He who presumed that Muhammad (may peace be upon him) saw         his Lord (with his ocular vision) fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I was reclining  but then sat up and said: Mother of the Faithful, wait a bit and do not be in a haste. Has  not Allah (Mighty and Majestic) said: “And truly he saw him on the clear horizon” (al- Qur’an, lxxxi. 23) and “he saw Him in another descent” (al-Qur’an, iiii. 13)? She said: I  am the first of this Ummah who asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  about it, and he said: Verily he is Gabriel. I have never seen him in his original form in  which he was created except on those two occasions (to which these verses refer); I  saw him descending from the heaven and filling (the space) from the sky to the earth  with the greatness of his bodily structure. She said: Have you not heard Allah saying.  “Eyes comprehend Him not, but He comprehends (all) vision and He is Subtle, and All- Aware” (al-Qur’an, v. 104)? (She, i.e. ‘Aisha, further said): Have you not heard that,  verily, Allah says: “And it is not vouchsafed to a human being that Allah should speak  unto him otherwise than by revelation, or from behind a veil, or that He sendeth a  messenger (angel), so that he revealth whatsoever He wills. Verily He is Exalted, Wise”  (al. Qur’an, xii. 51)She said: He who presumes that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) concealed anything, from the Book, of Allah fabricates the greatest lie  against Allah. Allah says: “O Messenger ! deliver that which has been revealed to thee  from thy Lord, and if thou do (it) not, thou hast not delivered His message” (al-Qur’an, v.  67). She said: He who presumes that he would inform about what was going to happen  tomorrow fabricates the greatest lie against Allah. And Allah says “Say thou  (Muhammad): None in the heavens and the earth knoweth the unseen save Allah” (al- Qur’an, xxvii 65).

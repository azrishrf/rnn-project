32|6372|  Chapter: The merit of one who resigns himself to the will of God calmly at the time of  the death of one’s son.  Abu Huraira reported that a woman came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  with her child and said: Allah’s Messenger, he is ailing, and I am afraid (that he may  die), as I have already buried three. Thereupon he said: It (their sad demise) would be a  protection against Hell-Fire for you. Zuhair has not mentioned the kunya of Abu Ghiyath;  he has mentioned his name.  OF RELATIONSHIP

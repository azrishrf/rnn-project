3|618|  Chapter: Bathing after sexual intercourse or seminal emission.  Hisham narrated it from his father, who narrated it on the authority of ‘Aisha that when  the Apostle (may peace be upon him) took a bath because of sexual inter-course, he  first washed the palms of his hands three times, and then the whole Hadith was  transmitted like that based on the authority of Abu Mu’awyia, but no mention is made of  the washing of feet.

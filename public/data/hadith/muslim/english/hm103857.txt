10|3857|  Chapter: He (the Holy Prophet) cursed the one who accepts interest and the one who pays it.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Gold is to be paid for by gold with equal weight, like for like, and  silver is to be paid for by silver with equal weight, like for like. He who made an addition  to it or demanded an addition dealt in usury.

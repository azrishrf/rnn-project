2|545|  Chapter: It is undesirable to put one’s hand in the utensil before washing it.  This hadith has been transmitted through other chains of transmitters on the authority of  Abu Huraira in which it is reported that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  made a mention of washing the hand, and did not instruct to wash it three times. But the  hadith narrated from Jabir and Ibn Musayyab. Abu Salama, and Abdullah b. Shaqiq,  Abu Salih, Abla Razin, there is a mention of “three times”.

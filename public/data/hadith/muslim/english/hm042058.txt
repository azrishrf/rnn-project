4|2058|  Chapter: Exhortation to shroud the dead body well.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) one day in the  course of his sermon made mention of a person among his Companions who had died  and had been wrapped in a shroud not long (enough to cover his whole body) and was  buried during the night. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) reprimanded (the  audience) that a person was buried during the night (in a state that) funeral prayer could  not be offered (over him by the Messenger of Allah). (And this is permissible only) when  it becomes a dire necessity for a man. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  also said: When any one of you shrouds his brother, he should shroud him well.

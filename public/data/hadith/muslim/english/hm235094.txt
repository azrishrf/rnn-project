23|5094|  Chapter: The merit of vinegar as a condiment.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took hold of  my hand one day (and led me) to his residence. There was presented to him some  pieces of bread, whereupon he said: Is there no condiment? They (the members of his  household) said: No, except some vinegar. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Vinegar is a  good condiment. Jabir said: I have always loved vinegar since I heard it from Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him). Talha said: I have always loved vinegar since I heard  about it from Jabir.

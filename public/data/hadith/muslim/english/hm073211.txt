7|3211|  Chapter: The merit of praying in the two mosques, at Mecca and Medina.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Prayer in the mosque of Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) is more excellent than a thousand prayers in  other mosques except the Masjid al-Haram, for Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) is the last of the Apostles, and his mosque is the last of the mosques. Abu Salama  and Abu Abdullah (two of the narrators in this chain of narrations said: We had no doubt  that what Abu Haraira (Allah be pleased with him) had said was from Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him), and so we did not like to get an attestation from Abu Huraira  about this Hadith until Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) died. We discussed it  (the issue of getting attestation from Abu Huraira) amongst ourselves and blamed one  another as to why we did not talk about it to Abu Huraira regarding it so that he could  attribute its transmission to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in case he had  heard It from him. While we were discussing it as we sat with ‘Abdullah b. Ibrahim b.  Qariz; we made a mention of this Hadith, and our omission (in getting its attestation)  about its direct transmission by Abu Huraira from him (the Holy Prophet); thereupon  Abdullah b. Ibrahim said to us: I bear witness to the fact that I heard Abu Huraira (Allah  be pleased with him) say that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am  the last of the Apostles and my mosque is the last of the mosques.

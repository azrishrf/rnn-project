1|78|  Chapter: Concerning exhortation to accord honour and respect to the neighbour and  the guest and obligation to observe silence except in goodness, and all these qualities  come within the orbit of Iman.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Shuraih al-Khuzaiâ€™ that the Prophet (may peace  and blessings of Allah be upon him) observed: He who believes in Allah and the Last  Day should do good to his neighbour and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day  should show hospitality to the guest and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day  should either speak good or better remain silent.

1|323|  Chapter: Pertaining to Jesus son of Mary and al-Masib al-Dajjil.  It is narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah b. Umar that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: I found myself one night near the Ka’bah, and I saw a man  with wheat complexion amongst the fair-complexioned men that you ever saw. He had a  lock of hair the most beautiful of the locks that you ever saw. He had combed it. Water  was trickling out of them. He was leaning on two men, or on the shoulders of two men,  and he was circumscribing the Ka’bah. I asked, What is he? It was said: He is al-Masih  son of Mary. Then I saw another person, stout and having too much curly hair, and blind  in his right eye as if it was a full swollen grape. I asked Who is he? It was said: He is al- Masih al-Dajjal.

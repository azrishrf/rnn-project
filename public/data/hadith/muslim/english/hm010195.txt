1|195|  Chapter: Serious prohibition of letting down the lower garment: of laying obligation of  selling goods by false oaths, and description of those three (persons) with whom Allah  would not speak on the Day of Resurrection nor would He see towards them nor would  absolve them, and for them is a painful chastisement.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) observed: Three (are the persons) with whom Allah would neither speak, nor  would He absolve them on the Day of Resurrection. Abu Muâ€™awiya added: He would not  look at them and there is grievous torment for them: the aged adulterer, the liar king and  the proud destitute.

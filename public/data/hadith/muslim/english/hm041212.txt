4|1212|  Chapter: Dhikr after the prayer.  ‘Aisha reported: The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) entered my house when a  Jewess was with me and she was saying: Do you know that you would be put to trial in  the grave? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) trembled (on hearing this)  and said: It is the Jews only who would-be put to trial. ‘Aisha said: We passed some  nights and then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do you know  that it has been revealed to me: “You would be put to trial in the grave”? ‘Aisha said: I  heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) seeking refuge from the  torment of the grave after this.

31|6139|  Chapter: Concerning the merits of the women of the Quraish.  Abu Huraira reported: I heard Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  The women of the Quraish are good amongst the womenfolk. They ride camels and  show affection to their children and zealously guard the wealth of their husbands. Abu  Huraira said at the end of this narration that Mary, the daughter of Imran, never rode the  camel.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

6|2430|  Chapter: It is forbidden to observe uninterrupted fasting.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Abstain from Saum-Wisal. They (his Companions) said:  Messenger of Allah, but you observe Saum Wisal. Upon this he said: You are not like  me in this matter, for I spend my night (in a state) that my Lord feeds me and provides  me drink Devote yourselves to the deeds (the burden of which) you can bear.

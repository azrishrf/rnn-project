3|590|  Chapter: The menstruating woman is permitted to wash the head of her husband, comb  his hair, and her left-over is clean, and one is permitted to recline in her lap and recite  the Qur’an.  ‘Aisha reported: I would drink when I was menstruating, then I would hand it (the vessel)  to the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he would put his mouth where mine had  been, and drink, and I would eat flesh from a bone when I was menstruating, then hand  it over to the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he would put his mouth where mine  had been. Zuhair made no mention of (the Holy Prophet’s) drinking.

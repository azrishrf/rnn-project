21|4808|  Chapter: It is permissible to make use of things necessary for hunting and chasing but  the use of small pebbles is disapproved.  Sa’id b. Jubair reported that a near one of ‘Abdullah b. Mughaffal threw pebbles. He  prohibited him (to do so). He said that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had  prohibited the throwing of pebbles by saying: It does not catch the game, nor does it  inflict defeat on the enemy, but breaks the tooth and puts the eye out. He (the near one  of Abdullah b. Mughadal) again repeated it (the act of throwing of pebbles) whereupon  he said: I narrate to you that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) disliked and  prohibited throwing of pebbles, but I see you again throwing pebbles; I (would therefore)  not speak with you.

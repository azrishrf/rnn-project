31|6150|  Chapter: The merits of the companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and of  those who are next to them and then of those who are next to them.  Abdullah reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The best of  my Umma would be those of the generation nearest to mine. Then those nearest to  them, then those nearest to them, then people would come whose witness would  precede the oath and the oath will precede the witness. Hannad has not made the  mention of Qarn in his narration. Qutaiba said that, instead of the word Qaum, the word  Aqwam has been used.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

30|5662|  Chapter: The miracles of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  Mu’adh b. Jabal reported that he went along with Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) in the  expedition of Tabuk and he (the Holy Prophet) combined the prayers. He offered the noon and  afternoon prayers together and the sunset and night prayers together and on the other day he  deferred the prayers; he then came out and offered the noon and afternoon prayers together. He  then  went  in  and  (later  on)  came  out  and  then  after  that  offered  the  sunset  and  night  prayers  together and then said: God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you  should not come to that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not  touch its water until I come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain  ahead of us. It was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) asked them whether they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him) scolded them, and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people  then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took it  again  in  that  (fountain)  and  there  gushed  forth  abundant  water  from  that  fountain,  until  all  the  people drank to their fill. He then said: Mu’adh, it is hoped that if you live long you would see its  water irrigating well the gardens.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

12|3972|  Chapter: Al-‘Umra (Life grant).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) as saying: Whoever a person is gifted a life grant, then it is for him  (belongs to him and to his posterity, for it belongs to him who has been given it). It  would not return to him who gave it for he conferred it as a gift (it becomes the property  of the donee and as such) rules of inheritance will apply to it.

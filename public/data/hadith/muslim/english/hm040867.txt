4|867|  Chapter: It is forbidden to lift one’s eye towards the sky in prayer.  Jabir b. Samura reported: We said our prayer with the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) and, while pronouncing salutations, we made gestures with our hands  (indicating) “Peace be upon you, peace be upon you.” The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) looked towards us and said: Why is it that you make gestures with  your hands like the tails of headstrong horses? When any one of you pronounces  salutation (in prayer) he should only turn his face towards his companion and should not  make a gesture with his hand.

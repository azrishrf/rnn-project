9|3584|  Chapter: The right of inheritance of property vests with one who emancipates the slave.  Ibn Umar reported that ‘Aisha decided to buy a slave-girl and then set her free, but her  masters said: We are prepared to sell her to you on the condition that her right of  inheritance would vest with you. She (Hadrat ‘Aisha) made a mention of that to Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) whereupon he said: This should not stand in your  way. The right of inheritance vests in one who emancipates.

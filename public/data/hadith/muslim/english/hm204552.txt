It has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters, on the authority of Simak  who said: Ash’ath b. Qais pulled him (Salama b. Yazid) when the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: Listen to them and obey them, for on them shall be the  burden of what they do and on you shall be the burden of what you do.

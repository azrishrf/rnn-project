6|2477|  Chapter: Permissibility of observing the fast or not observing it in the month of Ramadan for a  traveller.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We went out on an expedition  with Allah’s Messenger(may peace be upon him)on the 16th of Ramadan. Some of us  fasted and some of us broke the fast. But neither the observer of the fast found fault  with one who broke it, nor the breaker of the fast found fault with one who observed it.

7|3088|  Chapter: The wall of the Ka’ba and its door.  ‘Aisha reported: I asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about Hijr, and  the rest of the Hadith is the same. I also said: Why is it that the door has been made on  a higher level, and one cannot (get into it) but with the help of a ladder? The rest of the  Hadith is the same as reported above and the concluding words are: (I do not change it)  out of the apprehension that their hearts may disapprove of it.”

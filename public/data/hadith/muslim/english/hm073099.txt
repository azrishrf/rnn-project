7|3099|  Chapter: Travelling of a woman with her Mahram for Hajj, etc.  Qaza’ah reported: I heard a Hadith from Abu Sa’id (Allah be pleased with him) and it  impressed me (very much), so I said to him: Did you hear it (yourself) from Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him)? Thereupon he said: (Can) I speak of anything  about Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which I did not bear? He said: I  heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saying: Do not set out on a journey  (for religious devotion) but for the three mosques-for this mosque of mine (at Medina)  the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca), and the Mosque al-Aqsa (Bait al-Maqdis), and I heard  him saying also: A woman should not travel for two days duration, but only when there  is a Mahram with her or her husband.

22|4825|  Chapter: The proper time for sacrifice.  Al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) delivered an  address on the day (of Nahr) in which he said: None of you should offer sacrifice of  animals until he has completed the (‘Id) prayer. Thereupon my maternal uncle said:  Messenger of Allah, it is the day of meat, so it is not desirable (to keep my family in the  state of longing). The rest of the hadith is the same.

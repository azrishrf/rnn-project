4|1752|  Chapter: Excellence of the reciting of the Qur’an by one who is more skilled and  proficient before one who is inferior to him.         Ibrahim reported that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked ‘Abdullah b.  Mas’ud to recite to him (the Qur’an). He said: Should I recite it to you while it has been  sent down or revealed to you? He (the Holy Prophet) said: I love to hear it from  someone else. So he (‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud) recited to him (from the beginning of Surat  al Nisa’ up to the verse: ” How shall then it be when We bring from every people a  witness and bring you as a witness against them?” He (the Holy Prophet) wept (on  listening to it). It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Mas’ud through another chain of  transmitters that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) also said that he had  been a witness to his people as long as (said he): I lived among them or I had been  among them.

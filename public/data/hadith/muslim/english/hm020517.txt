2|517|  Chapter: Easing is forbidden in the streets and under the shade.  Anas b. Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) entered an  enclosure while a servant was following him with a jar of water and he was the youngest         amongst us and he placed it by the side of a lote-tree. When the Messenger of  Allah,(may peace be upon him) relieved himself, he came out and had cleansed himself  with water.

4|1483|  Chapter: Compensation of the missed prayer and excellence of observing it promptly.  Ibrahim reported: I heard ‘Abd al-Rahman as saying; ‘Uthman led us four rak’ahs of  prayer at Mina. It was reported to Abdullah b. Mas’ud and he recited: “Surely we are  Allah’s and to Him shall we return,” and then said: I prayed with the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) at Mina two rak’ahs of prayer. I prayed along with Abu Bakr  al-Siddiq two rak’ahs of prayer at Mina. I prayed along with ‘Umar b. Khattab two  rak’ahs of prayer at Mina. I wish I had my share of the two rak’ahs acceptable (to God)  for the four rak’ahs.

9|3576|  Chapter: Li’an (Invoking curse).  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported: A desert Arab came to Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: My wife has given birth to a dark- complexioned child and I have disowned him. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) said: Have you any camels? He said: Yes. He said: What is their colour? He  said? They are red. He said: Is there anyone dusky among them? He said: Yes. Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: How has it come about? He said:  Messenger of Allah, it is perhaps due to the strain to which it has reverted, whereupon  the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: It (the birth) of the black child may be  due to the strain to which he (the child) might have reverted.

22|4866|  Chapter: It was not permissible to eat the flesh of sacrificial animals beyond three days  at the beginning of Islam, but this prohibition was abrogated, and now it is permissible.  Abdullah b. Buraida reported on the authority of his father that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said this: I prohibited you from visiting the graves, but (now) you  may visit them, and I prohibited you (from eating) the flesh of sacrificed animals beyond  three days, but now keep it as long as you like. I prohibited you from the use of Nabidh  except (that prepared) in dry water-skins. Now drink (Nabidh prepared in any utensil),  but do not drink when it becomes intoxicant.

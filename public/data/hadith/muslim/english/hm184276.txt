18|4276|  Chapter: Stray thing found by anyone.  Zaid b. Khalid al-Juhani, the Companion of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him), said that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was asked about the  picking up of stray gold or silver, whereupon he said: Recognise well the strap and the  bag (containing) that and then make an announcement regarding that for one year, but  if none recognises it, then spend that and it would be a trust with you; and if someone  comes one day to make demand of that, then pay that to him. He (the inquirer) asked  about the lost camel, whereupon he said: You have nothing to do with that. Leave that  alone, for it has feet and also a leather bag, it drinks water, and eats (the leaves) of the  trees. He asked him about sheep, whereupon he said: Take it, it is for you, or for your  brother, or for the wolf.

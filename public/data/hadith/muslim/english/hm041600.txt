4|1600|  Chapter: The virtue of Sunan prayers before and after the Fard Rak’ahs and their number.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr reported: It was narrated to me that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) had said: The prayer observed by a person sitting is half of the  prayer. I came to him (may peace be upon him) and found him praying in a sitting  position. I placed my hand on his head. He said: O ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr, what is the matter  with you? I said: Messenger of Allah, it has been narrated to me that you said: The  prayer of a man in a sitting position is half of the prayer, whereas you are observing  prayer sitting. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes, it is so, but I am not like anyone  amongst you.

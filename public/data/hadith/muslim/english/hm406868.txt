40|6868|  Chapter: The dead would be shown his seat in Paradise and hell, and the affirmation of the  torment of the grave and seeking refuge from it.  Anas b. Malik reported: We were along with Umar between Mecca and Medina that we  began to look for the new moon. And I was a man with sharp eyesight, so I could see it,  but none except me saw it. I began to say to ‘Umar: Don’t you see it? But he would not  see it. Thereupon Umar said: I would soon be able to see it (when it will shine more  brightly). I lay upon bed. He then made a mention of the people of Badr to us and said:  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) showed us one day before (the actual  battle) the place of death of the people (participating) in (the Battle) of Badr and he was  saying: This would be the place of death of so and so tomorrow, if Allah wills. Umar  said: By Him Who sent him with truth, they did not miss the places (of their death) which  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had pointed for them. Then they were all  thrown in a well one after another. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then  went to them and said: O, so and so, the son of so and so; O so and so, the son of so  and so, have you found correct what Allah and His Messenger had promised you? I  have, however, found absolutely true what Allah had promised with me. Umar said:  Allah’s Messenger, how are you talking with the bodies without soul in them. Thereupon         he said: You cannot hear more distinctly than (their hearing) of what I say, but with this  exception that they have not power to make any reply.  INTIMATES

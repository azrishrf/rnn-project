31|6001|  Chapter: The merits of Fatima, daughter of Allah’s apostle (may peace be upon him).  (Imam Zain-ul-‘Abidin) ‘Ali b. Husain reported that when they came to Medina from  Yazid b. Mu’awiya after the martyrdom of Husain b. ‘Ali (Allah be pleased with him)  Miswar b. Makhramah met him and said to him: Is there any work for me which you ask  me to do? I said to him: No. He again said to me: Would you not give me the sword of  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for I fear that the people may snatch it  from you? By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long  as there is life in me. Verily ‘Ali b. Abi Talib sent a proposal of marriage to the daughter  of Abu Jahl in spite of (the fact that his wife) Fatima (had been living in his house).  Thereupon I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say while addressing  the people on the pulpit. He said: Fatima is a part of me and I fear that she may be put  to trial in regard to religion. He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been  from the tribe of ‘Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said:  Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me.  I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden,  but, by Allah, the daughter of Allah’s Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah  can never be combined at one place.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

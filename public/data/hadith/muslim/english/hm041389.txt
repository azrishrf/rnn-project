4|1389|  Chapter: Permission to remain away from the congregational prayer for any valid reason.  Thabit reported on the authority of Anas: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  came to us and there was none in our house but I, my mother and my aunt Umm  Haram. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Stand up so that I may lead you in prayer (and there  was no time for prescribed prayer). He led us in prayer. A person said to Thabit: Where  stood Anas with him (the Holy Prophet)? He replied: He was on the right side. He then  blessed us, the members of the household with every good of this world and of the  Hereafter. My mother said: Messenger of Allah (and then, pointing towards Anas, said),  here is your little servant, invoke the blessing of Allah upon him too. He then blessed  me with every good, and he concluded his blessings for me (with these words): Allah !  increase his wealth, and his children and make (them the source of) blessing for him.

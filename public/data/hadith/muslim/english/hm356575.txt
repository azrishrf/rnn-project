35|6575|  Chapter: The reciting of Subbin Allah in the morning and at the time of sleeping.  Juwairiya reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came out from (her  apartment) in the morning as she was busy in observing her dawn prayer in her place of  worship. He came back in the forenoon and she was still sitting there. He (the Holy  Prophet) said to her: You have been in the same seat since I left you. She said: Yes.  Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: I recited four words three  times after I left you and if these are to be weighed against what you have recited since  morning these would outweigh them and (these words) are: “Hallowed be Allah and         praise is due to Him according to the number of His creation and according to the  pleasure of His Self and according to the weight of His Throne and according to the ink  (used in recording) words (for His Praise).”  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

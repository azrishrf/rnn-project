41|6996|  Chapter: Story of Ibn Sayyid.  Abu Sa’id Khudri reported: We came back after having performed Pilgrimage or ‘Umra  and Ibn Sa’id was along with us. And we encamped at a place and the people dispersed  and I and he were left behind. I felt terribly frightened from him as it was said about him  that he was the Dajjal. He brought his goods and placed them by my luggage and I said:  It is intense heat. Would you not place that under that tree? And he did that. Then they  appeared before us a flock of sheep. He went and brought a cup of milk and said: Abu  Sa’id, drink that. I said it is intense heat and the milk is also hot (whereas the fact was)  that I did not like to drink from his hands or to take it from his hand and he said: Abu  Sa’id, I think that I should take a rope and suspend it by the tree and then commit  suicide because of the talks of the people, and he further said: Abu Sa’id he who is  ignorance of the saying of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (he is to be  pardoned), but O people of Ansar, is this hadith of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) concealed from you whereas you have the best knowledge of t this hadith of  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) amongst people? Did Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) not say that he(Dajjal) would be a non believer whereas I am  a believer? did Allah’s Messenger(may peace be upon him) not say he would be barren  and no child would be born to him, whereas I have left my children in Medina? Did  Allah’s Messenger (may peace upon him) not say: He would not get into Medina and  Mecca whereas I have been coming from Medina and now I intend to go to Mecca? Abu  Sa’id said: I was about to accept the excuse put forward by him, that he said: I know the  place where he would be born and where he is now. So I said to him: May your whole  days be spent

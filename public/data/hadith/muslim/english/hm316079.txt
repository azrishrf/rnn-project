31|6079|  Chapter: The merits of Hassan b. Thabit (Allah be pleased with him).         ‘Aisha reported that Hassin said: Allah’s Messenger, permit me to write satire against  Abu Sufyan, whereupon he said: How can it be because I am also related to him?  Thereupon he (Hassan) said: By Him Who has honoured you. I shall draw you out from  them (their family) just as hair is drawn out from the fermented (flour). Thereupon  Hassan said: The dignity and greatness belongs to the tribe of Bint Makhzum from  amongst the tribe of Hisham, whereas your father was a slave.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

4|1352|  Chapter: Time for the night prayer and its delay.  Abu Barza b. Aslami is reported to have said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) delayed the night prayer till a third of the night had passed and he did not  approve of sleeping before it, and talking after it, and he used to recite in the morning  prayer from one hundred to sixty verses (and completed the prayer at such hours) when  we recognised the faces of one another.

30|5701|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  Abu Dharr said: Allah’s Messenger, what about the vessels of that Cistern? He said: By  Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, the vessels would outnumber the stars in  the sky and its planets shining on a dark cloudless night. These would be the vessels of  Paradise. He who drinks out of it (the Cistern) would never feel thirsty. There would flow  in it two spouts from Paradise and he who would drink out of it would not feel thirsty;  and the distance between its (two corners) is that between ‘Amman and Aila, and its  water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey.

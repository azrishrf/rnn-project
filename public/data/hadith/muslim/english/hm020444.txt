2|444|  Chapter: The merit of Wudu and that of prayer after it.  Humran b. Abin reported: I used to fetch water for ‘Uthman for his purification. Never  was there a day that he did not take a bath with a small quantity of water. And Uthman  said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) at the time of our returning from  our prayer told us (certain things pertaining to purification). Mis’ar said: I find that it was  afternoon prayer. He said: I do not know whether I should tell you a thing or keep quiet.  We said: Messenger of Allah, tell us if it is good and if it is otherwise, Allah and His  Apostle know better. Upon this he said: A Muslim who purifies (himself) and completes  purification as enjoined upon him by Allah and then offers the prayers, that will be  expiatious (of his sins he committed) between these (prayers).

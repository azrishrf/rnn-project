4|804|  Chapter: The Tashahhud in prayer.  Ibn Abi Laila reported: Ka’b b. ‘Ujra met me and said: Should I not offer you a present  (and added): The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to us and we  said: We have learnt how to invoke peace upon you; (kindly tell us) how we should  bless you. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Say: “O Allah: bless Muhammad and his family  as Thou didst bless the family of Ibrahim. Verily Thou art Praiseworthy and Glorious, O  Allah.”

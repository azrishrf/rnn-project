7|2846|  Chapter: What is essential for him who enters into the state of Ihram for Hajj and then  comes to Mecca for circumambulation and running.  Wabara reported: While I was sitting in the company of Ibn ‘Umar, a person came to  him and said: Is it right for me to circumambulate the House before I come to stay (at  ‘Arafat)? Ibn ‘Umar said: Yes, whereupon he said: Ibn Abbas, however, says: Do not  circumambulate the House until you come to stay at ‘Arafat. Thereupon Ibn ‘Umar said:  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) Performed the Hajj and circumambulated  the House before coming to stay (at ‘Arafat). If you say the Truth, is it more rightful to  follow the saying of the Prophet (may peace be upon him) or the words of Ibn Abbas?

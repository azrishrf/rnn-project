33|6429|  Chapter: Everyone is born according to his true nature and the command pertaining to the  demise of the children of the infidels and of the children of the Muslims.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The  mother of every person gives him birth according to his true nature. It is subsequently  his parents who make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian. Had his parents been  Muslim he would have also remained a Muslim. Every person to whom his mother gives  birth (has two aspects of his life); when his mother gives birth Satan strikes him but it  was not the case with Mary and her son (Jesus Christ).

41|6985|  Chapter: The Last Hour would not come until a person would pass by a grave and wish that he  should have been the occupant of that grave because of this calamity.         Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The last  hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims  would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a  stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me;  come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews.

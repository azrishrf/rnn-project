11|3932|  Chapter: The law of inheritance in regard to al-Kalala (the person who dies leaving no  child or parent).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: I fell sick and there came to me  on foot Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr for inquiring after my  health. I fainted. He (the Holy Prophet) performed ablution and then sprinkled over me  the water of his ablution. I felt some relief and said: Allah’s Messenger, how should I  decide about my property? He said nothing to me in response until this verse pertaining  to the law of inheritance was revealed: “They ask you for a decision ; say: Allah gives  you a decision concerning the person who has neither parents nor children” (iv. 177).

1|172|  Chapter: He who dies associating none with Allah would enter Paradise and he who  dies as a polytheist would enter the fire of Hell.  Abu Dharr reported,: I came to the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he was  asleep with a white mantle over him. I again came, he was still asleep, I came again  and he had awakened. I sat by his side and (the Holy Prophet) observed: There is none  among the bondsmen who affirmed his faith in La illaha ill-Allah there is no God but  Allah) and died in this state and did not enter Paradise. I (Abu Dharr) said: Even if he  committed adultery and theft? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: (Yes) even though he  committed adultery and theft. I (again said): Even if he committed adultery and theft? He  replied: (Yes) even though he committed adultery and theft. (The Holy Prophet repeated  it three times) and said for the fourth time: In defiance of Abu Dharr. Abu Dharr then  went out and he repeated (these words): In defiance of Abu Dharr.

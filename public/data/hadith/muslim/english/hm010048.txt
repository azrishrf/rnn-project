1|48|  Chapter: He who meets his Lord with implicit faith would enter Heaven and fire would  be forbidden to harm him.  It is narrated on the authority of Mu’adh b. Jabal that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: Mu’adh, do you know the right of Allah over His bondsmen?  He (Mu’adh) said: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Messenger of Allah) said:  That Allah alone should be worshipped and nothing should be associated with Him. He  (the Holy Prophet) said: What right have they (bondsmen) upon Him in case they do it?  He (Mu’adh) said: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That He  would not punish them.

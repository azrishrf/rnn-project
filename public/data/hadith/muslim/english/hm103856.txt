10|3856|  Chapter: He (the Holy Prophet) cursed the one who accepts interest and the one who pays it.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Dates are to be paid for by dates, wheat by wheat, barley by  barley, salt by salt, like for like, payment being made on the spot. He who made an  addition or demanded an addition, in fact, dealt in usury except in case where their  classes differ. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Fudail b. Ghazwan with  the same chain of transmitters, but he made no mention of (payment being) made on  the spot.

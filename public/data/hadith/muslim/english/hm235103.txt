23|5103|  Chapter: Showing honour to the guest and the merit of making of sacrifice for him.  Miqdad reported: I and two of my companions were so much afflicted by hunger that we  had lost our power of seeing and hearing. We presented ourselves (as guests) to the  Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), but none amongst them  would entertain us. So we came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and he  took us to his residence and there were three goats. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be         upon him) said: Milk these for us. So we milked them and every person amongst us  drank his share and we set aside the share of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  (It was his habit) to come during the night and greet (the people present there) in a  manner that would not wake up one in sleep but make one who was awake hear it. He  would then go to the mosque and say prayer, then go to the milk and drink it. Miqdad  added: One night the Satan came to me when I had taken my share, and he said:  Muhammad has gone to the Ansar, who would offer him hospitality and he would get  what is with them, and he has no need for this draught (of milk). So I took (that milk) and  drank it, and when it had penetrated deeply in my stomach and I was certain that there  was no way out (but to digest it), the Satan aroused (my sense of) remorse and said:  Woe be to thee! what have you done? You have taken the drink reserved for  Muhammad! When he would come and he would not find it, he would curse you, and  you would be ruined, and thus there would go (waste) this world and the Hereafter (for)  you. There was a sheet over me; as I placed (pulled) it upon my feet, my head was  uncovered and as I placed it upon my head, my feet were uncovered, and I could not  sleep, but my two companions had gone to sleep for they had not done what I had  done. There came Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and he greeted as he  used to greet (by saying as-Salamu ‘Alaikum). He then came to the mosque and  observed prayer and then came to his drink (milk) and uncovered it, but did not find  anything in it. He raised his head towards the sky, and I said (to myself) that he (the  Holy Prophet) was going to invoke curse upon me and I would be thus ruined; but he  (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah, feed him who fed me and give drink to him who provided  me drink. I held tight the sheet upon myself (and when he had supplicated), I took hold  of the knife and went to the goats (possessed by the Holy Prophet) so that I may  slaughter one for Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which was the fattest  amongst them, and in fact all of them were milch goats; then I took hold of the vessel  which belonged to the family of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which  they used to milk and drink there-from, and milked them in that until it swelled up with  foam. I came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he said: Have you  taken your share of the milk during the night? I said: Drink it. and he drank it; he then  handed over (the vessel) to me and I said: Allah’s Messenger, drink it, and he drank it  and handed over (the vessel) to me again, I then perceived that Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) had been satiated and I had got his blessings. I burst into laughter  (so much) so that I fell upon the ground, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) said: Miqdad, it must be one of your mischief’s. I said: Allah’s Messenger,  this affair of mind is like this and this and I have done so. Thereupon. Allah’s Apostle  (may peace be upon him) said: This is nothing but a mercy from Allah. Why is it that you  did not give me an opportunity so that we should have awakened our two friends and  they would have got their share (of the milk)? I said: By Him Who has sent you with  Truth. I do not mind whatever you give (to them), and whatever the (other) people  happen to get, when I had got it along with you from among the people.

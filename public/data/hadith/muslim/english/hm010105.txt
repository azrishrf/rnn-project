1|105|  Chapter: Concerning diminution of Belief due to sins and its separation from the sinner;  negation of the excellence of Islam at the time of committing sin.  ‘Abdul-Malik b. Shu’aib narrated this hadith on the authority of Abu Huraira that he  observed: The Messenger of Allah said that a fornicator does not fornicate, and then  narrated the hadith like this, and he also made mention of plundering too, but did not  mention of a thin having value. Ibn Shihab said: Sa’id b. al-Musayyib and Abu Salama  narrated this hadith on the authority of Abu Huraira a hadith like that of Abu Bakr with  the exception of (the mention) of plundering.

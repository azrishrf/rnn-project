41|7003|  Chapter: Story of Ibn Sayyid.  Nafi’ reported that Ibn ‘Umar met Ibn Si’id on some of the paths of Medina and he said  to him a word which enraged him and he was so much swollen with anger that the way  was blocked. Ibn ‘Umar went to Hafsa and informed her about this. Thereupon she said:  May Allah have mercy upon you, why did you incite Ibn Sayyad in spite of the fact that  you knew it would be the extreme anger which would make Dajjal appear in the world?

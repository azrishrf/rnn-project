17|4193|  Chapter: Prescribed punishment for an adulterer and an adulteress.  This hadith has been reported on the authority of Qatada with the same chain of  transmitters except with this variation that the unmarried is to be lashed and exiled, and         the married one is to be lashed and stoned. There is neither any mention of one year  nor that of one hundred.

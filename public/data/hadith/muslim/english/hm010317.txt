1|317|  Chapter: Night journey of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) to Heaven  and the prayer made obligatory.  Abu al-‘Aliya reported: Ibn Abbas, the son of your Prophet’s uncle, told us that the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had observed: On the night of my night  journey I passed by Moses b. ‘Imran (peace be upon him), a man light brown in  complexion, tall. well-built as if he was one of the men of the Shanu’a, and saw Jesus  son of Mary as a medium-statured man with white and red complexion and crisp hair,  and I was shown Malik the guardian of Fire, and Dajjal amongst the signs which were  shown to me by Allah. He (the narrator) observed: Then do not doubt his (i.e. of the  Holy Prophet) meeting with him (Moses). Qatada elucidated it thus: Verily the Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him), met Moses (peace be upon him).

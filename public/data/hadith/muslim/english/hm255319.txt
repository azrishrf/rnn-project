25|5319|  Chapter: Forbiddance in calling one (other than Allah’s Apostle) with the Kunya of Abdu’l- Qasim and the fact pertaining to good names.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Give  the name after my name, but do not give (the kunya of Abu’l-Qasim after my) kunya, for  I am Abu’l-Qasim (in the sense) that I distribute amongst you (the spoils of war) and  disseminate the knowledge (of revelation). This hadith has been transmitted on the  authority of Abu Bakr but with a slight variation of wording.

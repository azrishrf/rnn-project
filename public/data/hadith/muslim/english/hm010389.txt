1|389|  Chapter: Pertaining to the words of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him): “I  would be the first among people to Intercede in the Paradise and among the Apostles I  would have the largest following”.         Abu Huraira said: The Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: There is for  every apostle a prayer which is granted, but every prophet showed haste in his prayer. I  have, however, reserved my prayer for the intercession of my Ummah on the Day of  Resurrection, and it would be granted, if Allah so willed, in case of everyone amongst  my Ummah provided he dies without associating anything with Allah.

26|5444|  Chapter: The excellence of curing (with the help of incantation) the influence of the evil eye and  small pustules and the poison (especially of snake and scorpion).  â€˜Aisha reported that when any person fell ill with a disease or he had any ailment or he  had any injury, the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) placed his forefinger upon  the ground and then lifted it by reciting the name of Allah. (and said): The dust of our  ground with the saliva of any one of us would serve as a means whereby our illness         would be cured with the sanction of Allah. This hadith has been transmitted on the  authority of Ibn Abu Shaiba and Zubair with a slight variation of wording.

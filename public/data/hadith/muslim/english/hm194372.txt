19|4372|  Chapter: Justification for killing those guilty of breach of trust and making the people of  the fort surrender on the arbitration of a just person.  It has been narrated on the authority of ‘Aisha that Sa’d’s wound became dry and was  going to heal when he prayed: O God, surely Thou knowest that nothing is dearer to me  than that I should fight for Thy cause against the people who disbeliever Your  Messenger (may peace be upon him) and turned him out (from his native place). If  anything yet remains to be decided from the war against the Quraish, spare my life so  that I may fight against them in Thy cause. O Lord, I think Thou hast ended the war  between us and them. If Thou hast done so, open my wound (so that it may discharge)  and cause my death thereby. So the wound begin to bleed from the front part of his  neck. The people were not scared except when the blood flowed towards them, and in  the mosque along with Sa’d’s tent was the tent of Banu Ghifar. They said: O people of  the tent, what is it that is coming to us from you? Lo! it was Sa’d’s wound that was  bleeding and he died thereof.

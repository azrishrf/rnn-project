30|5669|  Chapter: The extreme love of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for his Umma, and  his extreme anxiety to warn them against that which is a source of trouble to them.  Abu Musa reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The similitude of mine  and of that with which Allah sent me is that of a person who came to us and said: O people, I  have seen an army with my eyes and I am a plain warner (and issue you warning) that you should  immediately manage to find an escape. A group of people from amongst them paying heed (to  his warning) fled to a place of protection and a group amongst them belied him and the morning  overtook them in their houses and the army attacked them and killed them and they were routed.  And that is the similitude of the one who obeyed me, followed with which I had been sent and the  similitude of the other is of one who disobeyed and belied me and the Truth with which I have  been sent.

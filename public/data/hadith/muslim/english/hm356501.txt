35|6501|  Chapter: The disapproval of supplication in which a request is made to Allah for punishment of  one’s (misdeeds) in the world.  Anas reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited a person from  amongst the Muslims in order to inquire (about his health) who had grown feeble like  the chicken. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Did you supplicate for  anything or beg of Him about that? He said: Yes. I used to utter (these words): Impose  punishment upon me earlier in this world, what Thou art going to impose upon me in the  Hereafter. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Hallowed be  Allah, you have neither the power nor forbearance to take upon yourself (the burden of  His Punishment). Why did you not say this: O Allah, grant us good in the world and  good in the Hereafter, and save us from the torment of Fire. He (the Holy Prophet)  made this supplication (for him) and he was all right.  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

1|384|  Chapter: Pertaining to the words of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him): “I  would be the first among people to Intercede in the Paradise and among the Apostles I  would have the largest following”.  Anas b. Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I will  come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and would seek its opening  and the keeper would say: Who art thou? I would say: Muhammad. He would then say:  It is for thee that I have been ordered, and not to open it for anyone before thee.

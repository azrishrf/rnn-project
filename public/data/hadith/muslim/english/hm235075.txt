23|5075|  Chapter: It is forbidden to eat two dates or two morsels simultaneously.  Jabala b. Suhaim reported: Ibn Zubair used to provide us with dates during the time that  the people were hard pressed because of famine (Once) as we were busy in eating  there happened to appear before us Ibn ‘Umar. He said: Don’t eat two dates together,  for Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade eating them together but only  after seeking permission from his brother (partner). Shu’ba said: I do not think these  words pertaining to seeking permission but from the words of Ibn ‘Urnar.

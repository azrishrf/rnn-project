42|7139|  Chapter: It is prohibited to praise anyone so much that there may be fear of his being  intoxicated because of that.  ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakra reported on the authority of his father that a person  praised another person in the presence of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him),  whereupon he said: Woe be to thee, you have broken the neck of your friend, you have         broken the neck of your friend-he said this twice. If one of you has to praise his friend at  all, he should say: I think (him to be) so and Allah knows it well and I do not know the  secret of the heart and Allah knows the destined end, and I cannot testify his purity  against Allah but (he appears) to be so and so.

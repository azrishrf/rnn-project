10|3792|  Chapter: Command of killing dogs and then its abrogation, and prohibition of keeping them but  for hunting and protection of lands or cattle or like that.  Abu Mas’ud (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: A person from people who lived before you was called to account  (by Allah at the Day of Judgment) and no good was found in his account except this that  lie being a rich man had (financial) dealings with people and had commanded his  servants to show leniency to the straitened ones. Upon this Allah, the Exalted and  Majestic, said: We have more right to this, so overlook (his faults).

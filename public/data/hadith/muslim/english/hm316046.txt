31|6046|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Dharr (Allah be pleased with him).  ‘Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said: We set out from our tribe Ghafir who  look upon the prohibited months as permissible months. I and my brother Unais and our  mother stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell  jealous and they said: When you are away from your house, Unais commits adultery  with your wife. Our maternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin which was  conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with  you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle  began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we  encamped by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal  number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais  came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (Abu Dharr) said: My  nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said:  For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He  said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe  the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the  mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better  stay here. Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did  you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that  verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said:  They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the  poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his  (words). And I also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot  be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay  here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an  insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as- Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the  valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after  having regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn  and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I         stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of  Zamzam. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I  did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca  slept in the moonlit night and none was there to circumambulate the House but only two  women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na’ila (the two idols). They came  to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade  from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols’  private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in  metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one  amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used  for our idols before us). These women met Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has  happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka’ba  and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words  before us as we cannot express. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came  and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his  Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr  said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in  this way; Allah’s Messenger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may  be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the  tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to  myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar. I attempted to  catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me  from doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I  said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding  you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so  bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He  said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah’s  Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along with them.  Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta’if and that was  the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land  abounding in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of  Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit  them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have  you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the  prophethood of Allah’s Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I  also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us  came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also  embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our  camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief  was Aimi’ b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will  embrace Islam when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would come to  Medina, and when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina the  remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (may  peace be upon him) and said: Allah’s Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our  brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah’s         Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar  and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

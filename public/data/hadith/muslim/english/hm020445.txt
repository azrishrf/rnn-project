2|445|  Chapter: The merit of Wudu and that of prayer after it.  Jami’ b. Shaddad reported: I heard Humran b. Aban narrate to Abu Burda in this very  mosque during the governorship of Bishr that ‘Uthman b. Alfan said: The Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: He who completed ablution as Allah, the  Exalted, enjoined upon him, his obligatory prayers would be expiatious (for his minor  sins that he would commit) during (the interval) between them. This Hadith is  transmitted by Ibn Mu’adh, and in the Hadith narrated by Ghundar, the words “during  the governorship of Bishr” are omitted and there is no mention of the obligatory prayers.

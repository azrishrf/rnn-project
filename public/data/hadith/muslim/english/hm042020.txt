4|2020|  Chapter: The dead body is punished for the lamentation of his family.  Abu Musa reported that when ‘Umar was wounded, there came Suhaib from his house  and went to ‘Umar and stood by his side, and began to wail. Upon this ‘Umar said: What  are you weeping for? Are you weeping for me? He said: By Allah, it is for you that I  weep, O Commander of the believers. He said: By Allah, you already know that the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said: He who is lamented upon is  punished. I made a mention of it to Musa b. Talha, and he said that ‘Aisha told that it  concerned the Jews (only).

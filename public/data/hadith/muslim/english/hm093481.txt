9|3481|  Chapter: It is forbidden to divorce the woman during her menses.  Ibn Sirin reported: One who was blameless (as a narrator) narrated to me for twenty  years that Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him) pronounced three divorces to his wife  while she was in the state of menses. He was commanded to take her back. I neither  blamed them (the narrators) nor recognised the hadith (to be perfectly genuine) until I  met Abu Ghallab Yunus b. Jubair al-Bahili and he was very authentic, and he narrated  to me that he had asked Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with their) and he narrated it to  him that he made one pronouncement of divorce to his wife as she was in the state of  menses, but he was commanded to take her back. I said: Was it counted (as one  pronouncement)? He said: Why not, was I helpless or foolish?

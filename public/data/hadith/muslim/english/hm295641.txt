29|5641|  Chapter: Do not inform the vain sport of devil in a dream.  Jabir reported that there came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) a desert  Arab and said: Allah’s Messenger, I saw in the state of steep as if my head had been  cut off and I had been moving on haltingly after it. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said to that desert Arab: Do not narrate to the people the vain  sporting of satan with you in your sleep and (the narrator) also said: I heard Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) in his subsequent address: None amongst you  should narrate the vain sporting of devil with him in the dream.

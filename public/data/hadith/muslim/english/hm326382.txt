32|6382|  Chapter: A person would be along with him whom he loves.  Anas b. Malik reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I were coming  out of the mosque that we met a person on the threshold of the mosque and he said to  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him): When would be the Last Hour? Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What preparation have you made for that?  The man became silent and then said: Allah’s Messenger, I have made no significant  preparation with prayer and fasting and charity but I, however, love Allah and His  Messenger. Thereupon (the Holy Prophet) said: You would be along with one whom  you love.         OF RELATIONSHIP

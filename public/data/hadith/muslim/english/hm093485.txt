9|3485|  Chapter: It is forbidden to divorce the woman during her menses.  Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported: I divorced my wife while she was in  the state of menses. ‘Umar (Allah he pleased wish him) came to Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) and made mention of that to him, whereupon Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) told that we should take her back, and when she is pure he may  divorce her, if he would so wish. I (one of the narrators) said to Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be  pleased with them): Did you count (this pronouncement of divorce) in her case? He  said: What (after all) prevents him from doing so? Do you find him (Ibn Umar) either  helpless or foolish?

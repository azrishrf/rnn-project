5|2256|  Chapter: It is forbidden to beg.  Abu Umama reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: O son of  Adam, it is better for you if you spend your surplus (wealth), but if you withhold it, it is  evil for you. There is (however) no reproach for you (if you withhold means necessary)  for a living. And begin (charity) with your dependants; and the upper hand is better than  the lower hand.

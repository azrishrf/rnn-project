4|1972|  Chapter: Prayer at the time of solar eclipse.  ‘Ata’ reported: I heard ‘Ubaid b. ‘Umair say: It has been narrated to me by one whom I  regard as truthful, (the narrator says: I can well guess that he meant ‘Aisha) that the sun  eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he  stood up (in prayer) for a rigorously long time. He then bowed and then stood up and  then bowed and then stood up and then bowed, thus observing three ruku’s in two  rak’ahs and four prostrations. He then departed and the sun brightened. He pronounced  “Allah is the Greatest” while bowing. He would then bow and say: “Allah listened to him  who praised Him” while lifting up his head. He then stood up, and praised Allah and  lauded Him, and then said: The sun and the moon do not eclipse on the death of  anyone or on his birth. But both of them are among the signs of Allah with which Allah  terrifies His servants. So when you see them under eclipse, remember Allah till they are  brightened. This Hadith is narrated thus on the authority of ‘Aisha through another chain  of transmitters: “The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed six ruku’s  and four prostration in (two rak’ahs).”

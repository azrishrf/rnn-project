1|338|  Chapter: The meaning of the words of Allah: “He saw Him in another descent” (Al- Qur’an 2, liii. 13).Did the Apostle (may peace be upon him) see his Lord on the night of  his journey (to Heaven) ?.  Dawud reported on the same authorities the hadith as narrated above by Ibn ‘Uliyya and  added: She (‘Aisha) said: If Muhammad were to conceal anything which was sent to  him, he would have certainly concealed this verse: “And when thou saidst to him on  whom Allah had conferred favour and thou too had conferred favour: Keep thy wife to  thyself and fear Allah, and thou wast concealing in thy heart that which Allah was going  to disclose, and thou wast fearing men while Allah has a better right that thou shouldst  fear Him.”

24|5284|  Chapter: It is forbidden to beat the animal on the face or cauterise at the face.  Ibn Abbas reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw an ass which  had been cauterised on the face. He disapproved of it saying: By Allah, I do not  cauterise (the animal) but on a part at a distance from the face, and commanded (for  the cauterisation) of his ass and it was cauterised on the buttocks and he was the first to  cauterise on the buttocks.

10|3711|  Chapter: Forbiddance of al-Mubiqala, and al-Muzabana, and al-Mukhabara and the  sale of fruits before their good condition is clear, and al-Mu’awama, i.e., the sale for  some years.  Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) forbidding Muzabana and Muhaqala, and Mukhabara, and the sale of  fruits until they are ripe. I (the narrator) said to Sa’id (the other narrator): What does  ripening imply? He said: It meant that they become red or become yellow and are fit for  eating.

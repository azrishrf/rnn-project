15|4052|  Chapter: It is excellent to break the vow if one finds it better doing that which is against this vow  one should expiate it.  Abu Huraira reported: A person sat late in the night with Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him), and then came to his family and found that his children had gone to sleep.  His wife brought food for him, but he took an oath that he would not eat because of his  children (having gone to sleep without food) He then gave precedence (of breaking the  vow and then expiating it) and ate the food He then came to Allah s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) and made mention of that to him, whereupon Allah’s Messenger  (may peace he upon him) said: He who took an oath and (later on) found something  better than that should do that, and expiate for (breaking) his vow.

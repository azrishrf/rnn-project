31|6052|  Chapter: The merits of Jarir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him).  Jabir reported that there was in pre-Islamic days a temple called Dhu’l-Khalasah and it  was called the Yamanite Ka’ba or the northern Ka’ba. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) said unto me: Will you rid me of Dhu’l-Khalasah and so I went forth at the  head of 350 horsemen of the tribe of Ahmas and we destroyed it and killed whomsoever  we found there. Then we came back to him (to the Holy Prophet) and informed him and  he blessed us and the tribe of Ahmas.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

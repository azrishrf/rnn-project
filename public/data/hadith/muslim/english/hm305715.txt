30|5715|  Chapter: The valour and courage of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Anas b. Malik reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the  sublimest among people (in character) and the most generous amongst them and he  was the bravest of men. One night the people of Medina felt disturbed and set forth in  the direction of a sound when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) met them on  his way back as he had gone towards that sound ahead of them. He was on the horse         of Abu Talha which had no saddle over it, and a sword was slung round his neck, and  he was saying: There was nothing to be afraid of, and he also said: We found it (this  horse) like a torrent of water (indicating its swift-footedness), whereas the horse had  been slow before that time.

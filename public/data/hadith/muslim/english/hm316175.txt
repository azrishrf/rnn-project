They reviled him and beat him. He came to Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) and narrated to him (the story of atrocities  perpetrated upon him by the people of the tribe). Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said:  If you were to come to the people of ‘Uman, they would have neither reviled you nor  beaten you.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

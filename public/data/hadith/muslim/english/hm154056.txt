15|4056|  Chapter: It is excellent to break the vow if one finds it better doing that which is against this vow  one should expiate it.  Tamim b. Tarafa reported: A beggar came to ‘Adi b. Hatim and he begged him to give  him the price of a slave, or some portion of the price of the slave. He (‘Adi) said: I have  nothing to give you except my coat-of-mail and helmet. I will, however, write to my  family to give that to you, but he did not agree to that. Thereupon ‘Adi was enraged, and  said: By Allah, I will not give you anything. The person (then) agreed to accept that,  whereupon he said: By Allah, had I not heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) saying: “He who took an oath, but then found something more pious in the sight of  Allah, he should (break the oath) and do that which is more pious,” I would not have  broken the oath (and thus paid you anything).

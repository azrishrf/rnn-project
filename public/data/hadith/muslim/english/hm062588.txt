6|2588|  Chapter: Forbiddance to observe perpetual fast and excellence of observing fast on alternate  days.  Yahya reported: I and ‘Abdullah b. Yazid set out till we came to Abu Salama. We sent a  messenger to him (in his house in order to inform him about our arrival) and he came to  us. There was a mosque near the door of his house, and we were in that mosque, till he  came out to us. He said: If you like you may enter (the house) and, if you like, you may  sit here (in the mosque). We said: We would rather sit here and (you) relate to us. He  (Yahya) then narrated that ‘Abdullah b Amr b. al-‘As (Allah be pleased with them) told  him: I used to observe fast uninterruptedly and recited the (whole of the) Qur’an every  night. It (the uninterrupted fasting and recital of the Qur’an every night) was mentioned  to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) or he sent for me, and I went to him  and he said to me: I have been informed that you fast continuously and recite (the  whole of the Qur’an) every night. I said: Apostle of Allah, it is right, but I covet thereby  nothing but good, whereupon he said: It suffices for you that you should observe fast for  three days during every mouth. I said: Apostle of Allah, I am capable of doing more than  this. He said: Your wife has a right upon you, your visitor has a right upon you, your  body has a right upon you; so observe the fast of David, the Apostle of Allah (peace be  upon him), for he was the best worshipper of Allah. I said: Apostle of Allah, what is the  fast of David? He said: He used to fast one day and did not fast the other day. He (also)  said: Recite the Qur’an during every month. I said: Apostle of Allah, I am capable of  doing more than this, whereupon he said: Recite it in twenty days; recite it in ten days. I  said: I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Recite it every week,  and do not exceed beyond this, for your wife has a right upon you, your visitor has a  right upon you, your body has a right upon you. He (‘Amr b. ‘As) said: I was hard to  myself and thus I was put to hardship. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  had told me: ‘You do not know you may live long (thus and bear the hardships for a long  time), and I accepted that which the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had told  me. When I grew old I wished I had availed myself of the concession (granted by) the  Apostle of Allah (may-peace be upon him). This Hadith has been narrated by Yahya b.  Abu Kathir with the same chain of transmitters and he made this addition after these         words: During every month, (fasting) for three days, there is for you ten times for every  good and that is perpetual fasting (for three days would bring a reward for full thirty  days). I said: What is the fast of the Apostle of Allah, David? He said: Half of the age  (observing fast on alternate days for the whole life). And in the Hadith no mention has  been made of the recital of the Qur’an, and he did not say: Your visitor has a right upon  you, but (instead) he said: Your son has a right upon you.

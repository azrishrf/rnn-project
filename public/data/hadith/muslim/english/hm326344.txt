32|6344|  Chapter: The merit of removing of anything troublesome from the path.  Abu Barza reported that he said to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him): Allah’s  Messenger, I do not know whether I would survive after you, so confer upon me  something by which Allah should benefit me. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) said: Do this and that and remove the troublesome things from the paths.  OF RELATIONSHIP

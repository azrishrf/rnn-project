4|1668|  Chapter: Exhortation to supplicate and make mention (of Allah) at the end of the night and its  acceptance by the Lord.  Zirr (b. Hubaish) reported: I heard from Ubayy b. Ka’b a statement made by ‘Abdullah b.  Mas’ud in which he said: He who gets up for prayer (every night) during the year will hit  upon Lailat-ul-Qadr. Ubayy said: By Allah I there is no god but He, that (Lailat-ul-Qadr)  is in Ramadhan (He swore without reservation:) By Allah, I know the night; it is the night  on which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) commanded us to pray. It is  that which precedes the morning of twenty-seventy and its indication is that the sun  rises bright on that day without rays.

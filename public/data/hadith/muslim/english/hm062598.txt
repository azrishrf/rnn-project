6|2598|  Chapter: Forbiddance to observe perpetual fast and excellence of observing fast on alternate  days.  â€˜Abdullah b. Amr (Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) had said to him: Observe fast for a day and there would be  reward for you for the rest (of the days). He said: I am capable of doing more than this.  He then said: Observe fast for two days, and there would be reward for you for the rest  (of the days). He said: I am capable of doing more than this. He (the Holy Prophet) said:  Observe fast for three days and there would be reward for you for the rest of the days.  He said: I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Observe fast for four  days and there would be reward for you for the rest of the days. He said: I am capable  of doing more than this. Thereupon he said: Then observe fast (which is the) best in the  eye of Allah, the fast of David (peace be upon him); he used to observe fast one day  and break on the other day.

30|5742|  Chapter: The smiling of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and his excellent behaviour.  Simak b. Harb reported: I said to Jabir b. Samura: Did you have the privilege of sitting in  the company of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? He said: Yes, very  frequently, and added: He did not stand up (and go) from the place where he offered the         dawn prayer until the sun rose, and after the rising of the sun he stood up, and they (his  Companions) entered into conversation with one another and they talked of the things  (that they did during the Days of Ignorance), and they laughed (on their unreasonable  and ridiculous acts). Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) smiled only.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

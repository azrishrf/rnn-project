Abu Huraira reported that Tufail and his companions said: Allah’s Messenger, the tribe  of Daws has disbelieved and has belied you, so invoke curse upon them. It was said:  Let Daws be destroyed, whereupon he (Allah’s Messenger) said: Allah guide aright the  tribe of Daws and direct them to me.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

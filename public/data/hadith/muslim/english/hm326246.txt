32|6246|  Chapter: It is forbidden to commit oppression.  Abu Dharr reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that Allah,  the Exalted and Glorious, said: My servants, I have made oppression unlawful for Me  and unlawful for you, so do not commit oppression against one another. My servants, all  of you are liable to err except one whom I guide on the right path, so seek right  guidance from Me so that I should direct you to the right path. O My servants, all of you  are hungry (needy) except one whom I feed, so beg food from Me, so that I may give  that to you. O My servants, all of you are naked (need clothes) except one whom I  provide garments, so beg clothes from Me, so that I should clothe you. O My servants,         you commit error night and day and I am there to pardon your sins, so beg pardon from  Me so that I should grant you pardon. O My servants, you can neither do Me any harm  nor can you do Me any good. O My servants, even if the first amongst you and the last  amongst you and even the whole of human race of yours, and that of jinns even,  become (equal in) God-conscious like the heart of a single person amongst you, nothing  would add to My Power. O My servants, even if the first amongst you and the last  amongst you and the whole human race of yours and that of the Jinns too in unison  become the most wicked (all beating) like the heart of a single person, it would cause no  loss to My Power. O My servants, even if the first amongst you and the last amongst  you and the whole human race of yours and that of jinns also all stand in one plain  ground and you ask Me and I confer upon every person what he asks for, it would not in  any way, cause any loss to Me (even less) than that which is caused to the ocean by  dipping the needle in it. My servants, these for you I shall reward you for them, so he  who deeds of yours which I am recording finds good should praise Allah and he who  does not find that should not blame anyone but his own-self. Sa’id said that when Abu  Idris Khaulini narrated this hadith he knelt upon his knees.  OF RELATIONSHIP

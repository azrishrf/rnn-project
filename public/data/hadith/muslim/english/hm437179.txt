43|7179|  Chapter: Pertaining to the Words of Allah: “Adorn yourself at every place of worship”  (vii. 31).  Ibn Abbas reported: During the pre-Islamic days women circumambulated the Ka’ba  nakedly, and said: Who would provide cloth to cover the one who is circumambulating  the Ka’ba so that she would cover her private parts? And then she would say: Today will  be exposed the whole or the part and what is exposed I shall not make it lawful. It was  in this connection that the verse was revealed: “Adorn yourself at every place of  worship” (vii. 31).

11|3933|  Chapter: The law of inheritance in regard to al-Kalala (the person who dies leaving no  child or parent).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Allah’s Apostle(may peace be  upon him) and Abi Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) visited me on foot in Banu Salama,  and found me unconscious. He (the Holy Prophet) called for water and performed  ablution and sprinkled out of it (the water) over me. I felt relieved. I said: Allah’s  Messenger, what should I do with my property? And this verse was revealed: “Allah  enjoins you concerning your children: for the male is equal of the portion of two  females.”

30|5694|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  Haritha reported that he heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  His Cistern would be as extensive as the distance between San’a’ and Medina.  Mustaurid (one of the narrators) said: Did you not hear anything about the utensils?  Thereupon he said. No. Mustaurid said: You would find that the utensils would be like  stars.

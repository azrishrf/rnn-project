4|937|  Chapter: Recitation in the morning prayer.  Jabir reported: ‘Mu’adh b jabal al-Ansari led his companions in the night prayer and  prolonged it for them. A person amongst us said prayer (after having separated himself  from the congregation). Mu’adh was informed of this, and he remarked that he was a  hypocrite. When it (the remark) was conveyed to the man, he went to the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) and informed him of what Mu’adh had said. Upon this  the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to him: Mu’adh, do you want to  become a person putting (people) to trial? When you lead people in prayer, recite: “By  the Sun and its morning brightness” (Surah xci.), “Glorify the name of thy most high  Lord” (Surah lxxxvi.) and “Read in the name of Lord” (Surah xcvi.), and “By the night  when it spreads” (Surah xcii.).

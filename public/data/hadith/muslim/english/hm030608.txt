3|608|  Chapter: Bathing is obligatory for a woman after experiencing orgasm in dream.         Anas b. Malik reported that Umm Sulaim narrated it that she asked the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him) about a woman who sees in a dream what a man sees  (sexual dream). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon bi m) said: In case a  woman sees that, she must take a bath. Umm Sulaim said: I was bashful on account of  that and said: Does it happen? Upon this the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  said: Yes (it does happen), otherwise how can (a child) resemble her? Manâ€™s discharge  (i.e. sperm) is thick and white and the discharge of woman is thin and yellow; so the  resemblance comes from the one whose genes prevail or dominate.

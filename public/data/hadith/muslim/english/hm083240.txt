8|3240|  Chapter: He who sees a woman and his heart is affected, should come to his wife, and should  have intercourse with her.  Jabir reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (May peace be upon him) saw a woman, and so  he came to his wife, Zainab, as she was tanning a leather and had sexual intercourse  with her. He then went to his Companions and told them: The woman advances and  retires in the shape of a devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should come to  his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.

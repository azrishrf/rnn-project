4|1995|  Chapter: Mention of the torment of grave in eclipse prayer.  Ziyad b. ‘Ilaqa reported: I heard Mughira b. Shu’ba saying that the sun eclipsed during  the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the day when  Ibrahim died. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Verily  the sun and the moon are the two signs among the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse  on account of the death of anyone or on account of the birth of anyone. So when you  see them, supplicate Allah, and observe prayer till it is over.

20|4518|  Chapter: Obedience to the ruler is forbidden in matters sinful, but is otherwise  obligatory.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Holy prophet (may peace  be upon him) said: Whoso obeys me obeys God, and whoso disobeys me disobeys  God. Whoso obeys the commander (appointed by me) obeys me, and whoso disobeys  the commander disobeys me. The same tradition transmitted by different persons omits  the portion: And whose disobeys the commander disobeys me.

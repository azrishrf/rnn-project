16|4149|  Chapter: When anyone attacks the life of a person, or his limb and the victim wards off the  attack and in self-defence either the life of the assailant is lost or his limb broken, there would be  no penalty on the victim.  Safwan b. Ya’la b. Umayya thus reported from his father: I participated in the expedition  to Tabuk with Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him). And Ya’la used to say: That  was the most weighty of my deeds, in my opinion. Safwan said that Ya’la had stated: I         had a servant ; he quarrelled with another person, and the one bit the hand of the other.  (‘Ata’ said that Safwan had told him which one had bitten the hand of the other.) So he  whose hand was bitten drew ill from (the mouth) of the one who had bitten it and (in this  scuffle) one of his fore-teeth was also drawn out. They both came to Allah’s Apostle  (may peace be upon him) and he declared his (claim for the compensation of) tooth as  invalid.  MURDERS, FIGHTING, REQUITAL

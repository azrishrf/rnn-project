4|1218|  Chapter: Dhikr after the prayer.  ‘Aisha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) reported: The Apostle  of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to supplicate in prayer thus: “O Allah ! I seek  refuge with Thee from the torment of the grave, and I seek refuge with Thee from the  trial of the Masih al-Dajjal (Antichrist) and I seek refuge with Thee from the trial of life  and death. O Allah ! I seek refuge with Thee from sin and debt.” She (‘Aisha) reported:  Someone said to him -(the Holy Prophet): Messenger of Allah ! why is it that you so  often seek refuge from debt? He said: When a (person) incurs debt, (he is obliged) to  tell lies and break promise.

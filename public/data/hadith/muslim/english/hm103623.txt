10|3623|  Chapter: It is forbidden to meet the traders in the way for getting undue advantage.  Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Do not go out to meet merchandise in the way, (wait)until it is  brought into the market. This hadith has been reported on the authority of Ibn Numair  but with a slight change of words.

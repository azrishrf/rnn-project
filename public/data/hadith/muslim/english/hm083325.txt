8|3325|  Chapter: Excellence of emancipating a slave-girl and then marrying her.  Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon  him) set out on an expedition to Khaibar and we observed our morning prayer in early  hours of the dawn. The Apostle of Allah (May peace be upon him) then mounted and so  did Abu Talha ride, and I was seating myself behind Abu Talha. Allah’s Apostle (May  peace be upon him) moved in the narrow street of Khaibar (and we rode so close to  each other in the street) that my knee touched the leg of Allah’s Apostle (May peace be  upon him). (A part of the) lower garment of Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him)  slipped from his leg and I could see the whiteness of the leg of Allah’s Apostle (May  peace be upon him). As he entered the habitation he called: Allah-o-Akbar (Allah is the  Greatest). Khaibar is ruined. And when we get down in the valley of a people evil is the  morning of the warned ones. He repeated it thrice. In the meanwhile the people went  out for their work, and said: By Allah, Muhammad (has come). Abd al-‘Aziz or some of  our companions said: Muhammad and the army (have come). He said: We took it (the  territory of Khaibar) by force, and there were gathered the prisoners of war. There came  Dihya and he said: Messenger of Allah, bestow upon me a girl one of the prisons. He  said: Go and get any girl. He made a choice for Safiyya daughter of Huyayy (b. Akhtab).  There came a person to Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) and said: Apostle of  Allah, you have bestowed Safiyya bint Huyayy, the chief of Quraiza and al-Nadir, upon  Dihya and she is worthy of you only. He said: Call him along with her. So he came along  with her. When Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) saw her he said: Take any  other woman from among the prisoners. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet)  then granted her emancipation and married her. Thabit said to him: Abu Hamza, how  much dower did he (the Holy Prophet) give to her? He said: He granted her freedom  and then married her. On the way Umm Sulaim embellished her and then sent her to  him (the Holy Prophet) at night. Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) appeared as a         bridegroom in the morning. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He who has anything (to eat)  should bring that. Then the cloth was spread. A person came with cheese, another  came with dates, and still another came with refined butter, and they prepared hais and  that was the wedding feast of Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him)

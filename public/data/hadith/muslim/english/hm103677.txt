10|3677|  Chapter: It is forbidden to sell fresh dates against dry dates, except in case of al-Araya.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Do not buy the fruit until their condition is clear, and do not buy the  fresh dates. A hadith like this has been reported by Ibn ‘Umar through another chain of  transmitters.

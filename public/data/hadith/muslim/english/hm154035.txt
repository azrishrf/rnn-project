15|4035|  Chapter: It is forbidden to take the oaths in the name of anyone else besides Allah.  ‘Umar b. al-Khattib reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  Allah, the Great and Majestic, forbids you to swear by your fathers. Umar said: By Allah.  I have never sworn (by my father) since I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) forbidding it mentioning them “on my behalf” nor on behalf of someone else.

4|801|  Chapter: The placing of the right hand over the left hand after the first Takbir in prayer (Takbir-i- Tahrima) below the chest and above the navel and then placing them opposite the shoulders in  prostration.  Qatida has narrated a Hadith like this with another chain of transmitters. In the Hadith  transmitted by Jarir on the authority of Sulaiman, Qatida’s further words are: When (the  Qur’an) is recited (in prayer), you should observe silence, and (the following words are)  not found in the Hadith narrated by anyone except by Abu Kamil who heard it from Abu  ‘Awina (and the words are): Verily Allah vouchsafed through the tongue of the Apostle  of Allah (may peace be upon him) this: Allah listens to him who praises Him. Abu Ishaq  (a student of Imam Muslim) said: Abu Bakr the son of Abu Nadr’s sister has (critically)  discussed this Hadith. Imam Muslim said: Whom can you find a more authentic  transmitter of Hadith than Sulaiman? Abu Bakr said to him (Imam Muslim): What about  the Hadith narrated by Abd Huraira, i.e. the Hadith that when the Qur’an is recited (in         prayer) observe silence? He (Abu Bakr again) said: Then, why have you not included it  (in your compilation)? He (Imam Muslim) said: I have not included in this every Hadith  which I deem authentic; I have recorded only such ahadith on which there is an  agreement (amongst the Muhaddithin apart from their being authentic).

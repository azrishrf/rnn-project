4|1123|  Chapter: It is forbidden to remove pebbles and smooth the ground while engaged in  prayer.  Anas b. Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When  any one of you is engaged in prayer, he is holding intimate conversation with his Lord,  so none of you must spit in front of him, or towards his right side, but towards his left  side under his foot.

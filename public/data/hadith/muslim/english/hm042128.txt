4|2128|  Chapter: What is to be said while visiting the graveyard and the supplication to be  offered for the dead lying in the graves.  Sulaiman b. Buraida narrated on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) used to teach them when they went out to the graveyard. One  of the narrators used to say this in the narration transmitted on the authority of Abu  Bakr: “Peace be upon the inhabitants of the city (i.e. graveyard).” In the Hadith  transmitted by Zuhair (the words are): “Peace be upon you, the inhabitants of the city,  among the believers, and Muslims, and God willing we shall join you. I beg of Allah  peace for us and for you.”

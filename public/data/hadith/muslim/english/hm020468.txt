2|468|  Chapter: The washing of feet properly is indispensable in Wudu.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr reported: We returned from Mecca to Medina with the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him), and when we came to some water on the way, some of  the people were in a hurry at the time of the afternoon prayer and performed ablution  hurriedly; and when we reached them, their heels were dry, no water had touched them.  The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Woe to (dry) heels, because of Hell-fire.  Make your ablution thorough.

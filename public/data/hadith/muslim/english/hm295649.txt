29|5649|  Chapter: The vision of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  Abu Musa reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I saw in  sleep that I was about to migrate from Mecca to a land abounding in palm-trees and I  guessed that it would be Yamama or Hajar, but it was the city of Yathrib (the old name  of Medina), and I saw in this dream of mine that I was brandishing a sword and its upper  end was broken and this is what fell (in the form of misfortune to the believers on the  Day of Ubud). I brandished (the sword) for the second time and it became all right and  this is what came to be true when Allah granted us victory and solidarity of the  believers. And I saw therein cows also and Allah is the Doer of good. These meant the  group from amongst the believers on the Day of Ubud and the goodness which Allah         brought after that and the reward of attestation of his Truth which Allah brought to us  after the Day of Badr.

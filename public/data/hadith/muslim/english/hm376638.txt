37|6638|  Chapter: The mercy of Allah predominates his wrath.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that a  person committed sin beyond measure and when he was going to die, he left this will:  (When I die), bum my dead body and then cast them (the ashes) to the wind and in the  ocean. By Allah, if my Lord takes hold of me, He would torment me as He has not  tormented anyone else. They did as he had asked them to do. He (the Lord) said to the  earth: Return what you have taken. And he was thus restored to his (original form). He  (Allah) said to him: What prompted you to do this? He said: My Lord, it was Thine fear  or Thine awe, and Allah pardoned him because of this. Abu Huraira reported Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that a woman was thrown into Hell-Fire  because of a cat whom she had tied and did not provide it with food, nor did she set it  free to cat insects... until it died inch by inch. Zuhri said: (These two ahadith) show that  a person should neither feel confident (of getting into Paradise) because of his deeds,  nor should he lose (all hopes) of getting into Paradise.

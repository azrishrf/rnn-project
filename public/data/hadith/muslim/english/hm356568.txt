35|6568|  Chapter: Refuge from the evil of what one has done, and what one has not done.  Zaid b. Alqam reported: I am not going to say anything but only that which Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to say. He used to supplicate: “O Allah, I  seek refuge in Thee from incapacity, from sloth, from cowardice, from miserliness,  decrepitude and from torment of the grave. O Allah, grant to my soul the sense of  righteousness and purify it, for Thou art the Best Purifier thereof. Thou art the Protecting  Friend thereof, and Guardian thereof. O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from the  knowledge which does not benefit, from the heart that does not entertain the fear (of  Allah), from the soul that does not feel contented and the supplication that is not  responded.”  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

1|70|  Chapter: It is obligatory to love the Prophet more than the members of one’s  household: one’s child, father or even the whole of humanity.  It is reported on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) said: No bondsman believes, and, in the hadith narrated by Abdul Warith, no  person believes, till I am dearer to him than the members of his household, his wealth  and the whole of mankind.

Taubat Al-‘Anbari reported: Al-Sha’bi (one of the narrators) asked me if I had heard the  hadith transmitted on the authority of Hasan from the Prophet (may peace be upon  him). He said: I sat in the company if Ibn ‘Umar for two years or a year and a half but I  did not hear narrated from Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) but this one  (pertaining to the flesh of the lizard) as narrated by Mu’adh.

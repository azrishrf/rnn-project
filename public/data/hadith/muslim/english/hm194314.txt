19|4314|  Chapter: One should not desire an encounter with the enemy. but it is essential to show  patience during the encounter.  It is narrated by Abu Nadr that he learnt from a letter sent by a man from the Aslam  tribe, who was a Companion of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and whose  name was ‘Abdullah b. Abu Aufa, to ‘Umar b. ‘Ubaidullah when the latter marched upon  Haruriyya (Khawarij) informing him that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) in one of those days when lie was confronting the enemy waited until the sun had  declined. Then he stood up (to address the people) and said: O ye men, do not wish for  an encounter with the enemy. Pray to Allah to grant you security; (but) when you (have  to) encounter them exercise patience, and you should know that Paradise is under the  shadows of the swords. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood         up (again) and said: O Allah. Revealer of the Book, Disperser of the clouds, Defeater of  the hordes, put our enemy to rout and help us against them.

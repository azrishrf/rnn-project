40|6795|  Chapter: The first group that would be admitted to Paradise would be like the face of the full  moon and the description of their qualities and their spouses.  This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira through another chain of  transmitters that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The (members of  the) first group which would get into Paradise will have their faces as bright as stars in  the sky. They would neither pass water, nor void excrement, nor will they suffer from  catarrh, nor will they spit, and their combs would be made of gold, and their sweat will  be musk, the fuel of their brazier will be aloes, and their wives will be large-eyed  maidens and their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father  (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

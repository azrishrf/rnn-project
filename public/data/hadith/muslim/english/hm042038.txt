4|2038|  Chapter: The dead body is punished for the lamentation of his family.  Hafsa narrated on the authority of Umm ‘Atiyya that she said: When this verse was  revealed: “When believing women came to thee giving thee a pledge that they will not  associate aught with Allah, and will not disobey thee in good” (lx. 12), she (Umm Atiyya)  said: In (this pledge) was also included wailing. I said: Messenger of Allah I except  members of such a tribe who helped me (in lamentation) during pre-Islamic days, there  is left no alternative for me, but that I should also help them. Upon this the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) said: (Yes) but only in case of the members of such a  tribe.

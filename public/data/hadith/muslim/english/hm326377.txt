Abu Huraira narrated directly from Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that he  said: People are like mines of gold and silver; those who were excellent in Jahiliya  (during the days of ignorance) are excellent In Islam, when they have, an  understanding, and the souls are troops collected together and those who had a mutual  familiarity amongst themselves in the store of prenatal existence would have affinity  amongst them, (in this world also) and those who opposed one of them, would be at  variance with one another.

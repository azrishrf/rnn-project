24|5149|  Chapter: The use of gold and silver vessels to forbidden to men and women and it is  also prohibited to drink in them.         Abdullah, the freed slave of Asma’ (the daughter of Abu Bakr), the maternal uncle of the  son of ‘Ata, reported: Asma’ sent me to ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar saying: The news has  reached me that you prohibit the use of three things: the striped robe, saddle cloth  made of red silk and the fasting in the holy month of Rajab. ‘Abdullah said to me: So far  as what you say about fasting in the month of Rajab, how about one who observes  continuous fasting?-and so far as what you say about the striped garment, I heard Umar  b. Khatab say that he had heard from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him): He  who wears silk garment has no share for him (in the Hereafter), and I am afraid it may  not be that striped garment; and so far as the red saddle cloth is concerned that is the  saddle cloth of Abdullah and it is red. I went back to Asma’ and informed her.  whereupon she said: Here is the cloak of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him),  and she brought out to me that cloak made of Persian cloth with a hem of brocade, and  its sleeves bordered with brocade and said: This wall Allah’s Messenger’s cloak with  ‘Aisha until she died, and when she died. I got possession of it. The Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him) used to wear that, and we washed it for the sick and sought  cure thereby.

30|5663|  Chapter: The miracles of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  Abu Humaid as-Sa’idi reported: We went out with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  on  the  expedition  to  Tabuk  and  we  came  to  a  wadi  where  there  was  a  garden  belonging  to  a         woman. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said. Make an assessment (of the price of its  fruit). And Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also made an assessment and it was ten  wasqs. He asked that lady (to calculate the amount) until they would, God willing, come back to  her. So we proceeded on until we came to Tabuk and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) said: The violent storm will overtake you during the night, so none amongst you should stand  up and he who has a camel with him should hobble it firmly. A violent storm blew and a person  who had stood up was carried away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy.  Then the messenger of the son of al ‘Alma’, the ruler of Aila, came to Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) with a letter and a gift of a white mule. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) wrote him (the reply) and presented him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the  Wadi al-Qura. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked that lady about her garden and  the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) said: I am going to depart, and he who amongst you wishes may depart with me but  he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the journey until we came to the outskirts of Medina.  (It was at this time) that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This is Taba, this is  Uhud,  that  is  a  mountain  which  loves  us  and  we  love  it,  and  then  said:  The  best  amongst  the  houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the  house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa’ida, and there is goodness in  all the houses of the Ansar. Said b. Ubada came to us and Abu Usaid said to him: Did you not  see that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has declared the houses of the Ansar good  and he has kept us at the end. Said met Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said:  Allah’s Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the  end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.

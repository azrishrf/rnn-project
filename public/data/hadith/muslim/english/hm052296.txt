5|2296|  Chapter: Bestowal upon one who is firm in faith.  Anas b. Malik reported: I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) and he had put on a mantle of Najran with a thick border. A bedouin met him and  pulled the mantle so violently that I saw this violent pulling leaving marks of the border  of the mantle on the skin of the neck of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him). And he (the bedouin) said: Muhammad, issue command that I should be given out  of the wealth of Allah which is at your disposal. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) turned his attention to him and smiled, and then ordered for him a gift  (provision).

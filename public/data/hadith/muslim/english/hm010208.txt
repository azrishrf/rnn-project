1|208|  Chapter: Suicide is the gravest sin.  It is reported on the authority of Hasan: Jundab b. â€˜Abdullah al-Bajali narrated this  hadith in this mosque which we can neither forget and at the same time we have no  apprehension that Jundab could attribute a lie to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him). He (the Holy Prophet) observed: A person belonging to the people of the  past suffered from a boil, and then the rest of the hadith was narrated.

31|6174|  Chapter: Instructions of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) in regard to the people of  Egypt.  Abu Dharr reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: You would  soon conquer Egypt and that is a land which is known (as the land of al-qirat). So when  you conquer it, treat its inhabitants well. For there lies upon you the responsibility  because of blood-tie or relationship of marriage (with them). And when you see two  persons falling into dispute amongst themselves for the space of a brick, than get out of  that. He (Abu Dharr) said: I saw Abd al-Rahman b. Shurahbil b. Hasana and his brother  Rabi’a disputing with one another for the space of a brick. So I left that (land).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

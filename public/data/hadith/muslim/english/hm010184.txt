1|184|  Chapter: Beating of the cheeks, tearing of the front opening of the shirt, and calling the  calls of the Jihillya (Ignorance) are forbidden.  It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Mas’ud that the Holy Prophet observed: He  is not one of us (one among the Ummah of Islam) who beat the cheeks or tore the front         opening of the shirt or uttered the slogans of (the days of) Jahiliya (ignorance). Ibn  Numair and Abu Bakr said (instead of the word “au”(or) it is “wa” [and] the words are)  and tore and uttered (the slogans) of Jahiliya without “alif”.

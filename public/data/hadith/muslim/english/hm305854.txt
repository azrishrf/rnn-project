30|5854|  Chapter: Pertaining to the merits of Moses (peace be upon him).  Abu Fluraira reported that two persons, one from amongst the Jews and the other from  amongst the Muslims, fell into dispute and began to abuse one another. The Muslim  said: By Him Who chose Muhammad (may peace be upon him) in the worlds. And the  Jew said: By Him Who chose Moses in the worlds. Thereupon the Muslim lifted his  hand and slapped at the face of the Jew. The Jew went to Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) and told him about his affair and the affair of the Muslim.  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) laid: Don’t make me superior  to Moses for mankind will swoon and I would be the ‘first to recover from it and Moses  would be at that time seizing the side of the Throne and I do not know (whether) he  would swoon and would recover before me or Allah would make an exception for him.

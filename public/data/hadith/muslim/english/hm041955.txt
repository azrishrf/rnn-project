4|1955|  Chapter: Supplication in prayer for rain.  Anas b. Malik reported that a person entered the mosque through the door situated on  the side of Daral-Qada’ during Friday (prayer) and the messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) was delivering the sermon while standing. He came and stood in front of  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, the  camels died and the passages were blocked; so supplicate Allah to send down rain  upon us. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) raised his hands and then  said: (O Allah, send down rain upon us; O Allah, send down rain upon us; O Allah, send  down rain upon us. Anas said: By Allah, we did not see any cloud or any patch of it, and  there was neither any house or building standing between us and the (hillock) Sal’a.  There appeared a cloud in the shape of a shield from behind it, and as it (came high) in  the sky it spread and then there was a downpour of rain. By Allah, we did not see the  sun throughout the week. Then (that very man) came on the coming Friday through the  same door when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was standing and  delivering the sermon. He stood in front of him and said: Messenger of Allah, our  animals died and the passages blocked. Supplicate Allah to stop the rain for us. The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) again raised his hands and said: O Allah,  let it (rain) fall in our suburbs and not on us, O Allah (send it down) on the hillocks and  small mountains and the river-beds and at places where trees grow. The rain stopped,  and as we stepped out we were walking in sunshine. He (the narrator) said to Sharik: I  asked Anas b. Malik if he was the same man. He said: I do not know.

32|6223|  Chapter: It is forbidden to nurse rancour.         Abu Huraira reported it as a marfuâ€™ hadith (and the words are): The deeds are  presented on every Thursday and Friday and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, grants  pardon to every person who does not associate anything with Allah except the person in  whose (heart) there is rancour against his brother. It would be said: Put both of them off  until they are reconciled.  OF RELATIONSHIP

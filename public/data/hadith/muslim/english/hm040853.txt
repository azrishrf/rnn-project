4|853|  Chapter: If something happens in prayers, men should glorify Allah and women should clap  hands.  Abu Huraira reported: one day the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led the  prayer. Then turning (towards his Companions) he said: O you, the man, why donâ€™t you  say your prayer well? Does the observer of prayer not see how he is performing the  prayer for he performs it for himself? By Allah, I see behind me as I see In front of me.

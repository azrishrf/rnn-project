26|5379|  Chapter: The right of a Muslim upon another Muslim is that his greeting should be responded.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Six are  the rights of a Muslim over another Muslim. It was said to him: Allah’s Messenger, what  are these? Thereupon he said: When you meet him, offer him greetings; when he  invites you to a feast accept it, when he seeks your council give him, and when he  sneezes and says: “All praise is due to Allah,” you say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah show  mercy to you); and when he fails ill visit him; and when he dies follow his bier.

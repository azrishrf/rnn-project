1|213|  Chapter: Exhortation to be prompt in doing good deeds before the appearance of  turbulence.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) observed: Be prompt in doing good deeds (before you are overtaken) by  turbulence which would be like a part of the dark night. During (that stormy period) a  man would be a Muslim in the morning and an unbeliever in the evening or he would be  a believer in the evening and an unbeliever in the morning, and would sell his faith for  worldly goods.

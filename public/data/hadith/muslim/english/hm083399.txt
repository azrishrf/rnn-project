8|3399|  Chapter: Kitab Al-Rada’a-Book pertaining to fosterage.         ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that there came Aflah the brother, of Abu’l- Qu’ais, who sought her permission (to enter) after seclusion was instituted, and Abu- Qu’ais was the father of ‘Aisha by reason of fosterage. ‘Aisha said: By Allah, I would not  permit Aflah unless I have solicited the opinion of Allah’s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) for Abu Qulais has not suckled me, but his wife has given me suck.  ‘Aisha'(Allah be pleased with her) said: When Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon  him) entered, I said: Allah’s Messenger, Aflah is the brother of Abu’l-Qulais; he came to  me to seek my permission for entering (the house). I did not like the idea of granting him  permission until I had solicited your opinion. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (May peace be  upon him) said: Grant him permission. ‘Urwa said it was on account of this that ‘Aisha  used to say. What is unlawful by reason of consanguinity is unlawful by reason of  fosterage.

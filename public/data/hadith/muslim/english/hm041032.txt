4|1032|  Chapter: The excellence of the prayer and the way it is begun and the excellence of  Ruku’ and moderation in it and prostration and moderation in it, etc.  Abu Dharr reported: The Messenger of ‘Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When any  one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the  saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of         the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I  said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguish it from the red  dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of  Allah(may peace be upon him) as you are asking me, and he said: The black dog is a  devil.

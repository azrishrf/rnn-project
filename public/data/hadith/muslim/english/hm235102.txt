23|5102|  Chapter: Showing honour to the guest and the merit of making of sacrifice for him.  Abu Huraira reported that a man came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  so that he should entertain him as a guest, but he had nothing with which he could  entertain him. He, therefore, asked if there was any person who would entertain him  (assuring the audience) that Allah would show mercy to him. A person from the Ansar  who was called Abu Talha stood up and he took him to his house. The rest of the hadith  is the same and mention is (also) made in that about the revelation of the verse as  narrated by Waki’.

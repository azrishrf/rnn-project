6|2576|  Chapter: The fasts observed by the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) besides  Ramadhan.  Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported: I said to â€˜Aisha (Allah be pleased with her): Did the Apostle  of Allah (may peace be upon him) observe fast for full one month besides Ramadan?  She said: I do not know of any month in which he fasted throughout, but that of the         month of Ramadan and (the month) in which he did not fast at all, till he ran the course  of his life.

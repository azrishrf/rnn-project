10|3917|  Chapter: Unknown.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) as saying: There is pre-emption in everything which is shared, be it land,  or a dwelling or a garden. It is not proper to sell it until he informs his partner; he may go  in for that, or he may abandon it; and it he (the partner intending to sell his share) does  not do that, then his partner has the greatest right to it until he permits him.

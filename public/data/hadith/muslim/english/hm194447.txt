19|4447|  Chapter: The battle of Ahzab or Khandaq (the tribes or the ditch).  According to still another version of the tradition narrated by the same authority, and  handed down through a different chain of transmitters, it has been reported that they  (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) were reciting rajaz verses and the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) was (reciting) with them. And they were chanting:  O God, there is no good but the good of the Hereafter, so help Thou the Ansar and the  Muhajirs. Shaiban substituted “So forgive Thou” for “So help Thou”.

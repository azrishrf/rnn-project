5|2289|  Chapter: Excellence of abstaining from begging and that of endurance.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had  said: The most dreadful thing I fear in your case is what Allah brings forth for you in the  form of the adornment of the world. They (the Prophet’s Companions) said: Messenger  of Allah, what is the adornment of the world? He said: Blessings (the natural resources)  of the earth. They (again) said: Messenger of Allah, does good produce evil? He said:  No, only good comes out of good. No, only good comes out of good. No. only good  comes out of good. All that which the spring rain helps to grow kills or is about to kill but  (the animal) which feeds on vegetation. It eats and when its flanks are distended, it  faces the sun, it chews the cud, it has dunged and urinated, it returns and eats. This  wealth is green and sweet, and he who accepts it and applies it rightly, finds it a good  help, but he who takes it wrongfully is like one who eats without being satisfied.

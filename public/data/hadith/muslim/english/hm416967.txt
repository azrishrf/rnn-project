41|6967|  Chapter: The Last Hour would not come until a person would pass by a grave and wish that he  should have been the occupant of that grave because of this calamity.  This hadith has been transmitted on the same authority but with this variation that the  hadith transmitted on the authority of Nabra (the words are): One Who is better than I  informed me, and he was Abu Qatatda, and in the hadith transmitted on the authority of  Khalid instead of the word ‘buus’ there is ‘dys’ or ‘yadis’, i.e. “how sad it is”.

31|6053|  Chapter: The merits of Jarir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him).  Jarir b. ‘Abdullah al-Bajali said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me:  Can’t on rid me of Dhu’I-Khalasah, the idol-house of Khath’am, and this idol-house was  called the Yamanite Ka’ba. So I went along with 150 horsemen and I could not sit with  steadfastness upon the horse. I made the mention of it to Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) and he struck his hand on my chest and said: O Allah, grant him  steadfastness and make him the guide of righteousness and the rightly-guided one. So  he went away and he set fire to it. Then Jarir sent some person to Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) whose Kunya was Abu Arta to give him the happy news  about that. He came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: I have  not come to you (but with the news) that we have left Dhu’l-Khalasah as a scabbed  camel. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) blessed the horses of  Ahmas and the men of their tribe five times.         HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

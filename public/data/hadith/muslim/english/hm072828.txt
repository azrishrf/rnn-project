7|2828|  Chapter: Permissibility of the Tamattu’ (form of pilgrimage).  Mutarrif reported: ‘Imran b. Husain sent for me during his illness of which he died, and  said: I am narrating to you some ahadith which may benefit you after me. If I live you  conceal (the fact that these have been transmitted by me), and if I die, then you narrate  them if you like (and these are): I am blessed, and bear in mind that the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) combined Hajj and Umra. Then no verse was revealed  in regard to it in the Book of Allah (which abrogated it) and the Apostle of Allah (may  peace be upon him) did not forbid (from doing it). And whatever a person (,Umar) said  was out of his personal opinion.

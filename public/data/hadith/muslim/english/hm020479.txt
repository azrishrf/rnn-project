2|479|  Chapter: It is commendable to include forehead in washing the face and elbow and  ankle in washing the hands and feet, while performing ablution.  Abu Huraira reported: Verily Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: My  Cistern has its dimensions wider than the distance between Aila and Aden, and its  water is whiter than ice and sweeter than the honey diluted with milk, and its cups are  more numerous than the numbers of the stars. Verily I shall prevent the (faithless)  people there-from just as a man prevents the camels of the people from his fountain.  They said: Messenger of Allah will you recognise us on that day? He said: Yes, you will  have distinctive marks which nobody among the peoples (except you) will have; you  would come to me with blazing forehead and bright hands and feet on account of the  traces of ablution.

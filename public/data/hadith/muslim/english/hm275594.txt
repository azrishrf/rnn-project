27|5594|  Chapter: The proper use of the words: Bondman, Slave-girl, Al-Maula and As-Sayyid.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) so many ahadith and  one of them is this that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: None of you  should say: Supply drink to your lord, feed your lord, hell) your lord in performing  ablution, and none of you should say: My Lord. He should say: My chief, my patron; and  none of you should say: My bondman, my slave-girl, but simply say: My boy, my girl, my  servant.

35|6485|  Chapter: It is not something appreciable to make request for death from the Lord when one is in  trouble.  Hammam b. Munabbih said: Abu Huraira narrated to us ahadith from Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) and out of these one is that Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) said: None amongst you should make a request for death, and do not call  for it before it comes, for when any one of you dies, he ceases (to do good) deeds and  the life of a believer is not prolonged but for goodness.         REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

31|6019|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud and that of his mother (Allah be pleased with them).  Abu Ishaq reported that he heard Abu’l-Ahwas say: I was along with Abu Musa and Abu  Mas’ud as Ibn Mas’ud died and one of them said to the other: Do you find one like him  besides him? Thereupon he said: Do you say this (no one can be his rival)? He was         admitted (to the company of the Holy Prophet) whereas we were detained and he had  been present in the company of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) whereas  we had been absent.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

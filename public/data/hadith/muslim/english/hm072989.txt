7|2989|  Chapter: It is preferable to get one’s hair cut (as a ritual of pilgrimage) but clipping is  also permissible.  Yahya b. al-Husain reported on the authority of his grandfather that Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) invoked blessing on the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage three  times for those who got their heads shaved and once for those who got their hair  clipped. In the narration transmitted by Waki’ there is no mention of the Farewell  Pilgrimage.

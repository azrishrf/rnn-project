4|2041|  Chapter: Washing of the dead body.  Umm ‘Atiyya reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to us when  we were bathing his daughter, and he told us: Wash her with water and (with the leaves  of) the lote tree, three or five times, or more than that if you think fit, and put camphor or  something like camphor in the last washing; then inform me when you have finished. So  when we had finished, we informed him, and he gave to us his (own) under-garment  saying: “Put it next her body.”

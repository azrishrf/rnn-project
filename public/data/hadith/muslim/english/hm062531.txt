6|2531|  Chapter: He who ate on the day of Ashura should abstain (from eating) for the rest of the day  (as a mark of respect).  Rubayyi’ daughter of Mu’awwidh b. ‘Afra’ said that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) sent (a person) on the morning of Ashura to the villages of Ansar around  Medina (with this message): He who got up in the morning fasting (without eating  anything) he should complete his fast, and he who had had his breakfast in the morning,  he should complete the rest of the day (without food). The Companions said; We  henceforth observed fast on it (on the day of ‘Ashura) and, God willing, made our  children observe that. We went to the mosque and made toys out of wool for them and  when anyone felt hungry and wept for food we gave them these toys till it was the time  to break the fast.

4|1880|  Chapter: Concerning the two sermons before the Friday prayer and sitting for a while  between the two.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported: While the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was  delivering (a sermon) on Friday, a caravan of merchandise came to Medina. The         Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) rushed towards it till  only twelve persons were left with him including Abu Bakr and ‘Umar; and it was at this  occasion that this verse was revealed. “And when they see merchandise or sport, they  break away to it.”

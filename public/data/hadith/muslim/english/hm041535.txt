4|1535|  Chapter: Excellence to be on the right side of the Imam.  ‘Abdullah b. Malik b. Buhaina reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) happened to pass by a person who was busy in praying while the (Fard of the)  dawn prayer had commenced. He said something to him, which we do not know what it  was. When we turned back we surrounded him and said: What is it that the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to you? He replied: He (the Holy Prophet) had  said to me that he perceived as if one of them was about to observe four (rak’ahs) of the  dawn prayer. Qa’nabi reported that ‘Abdullah b. Malik b. Buhaina narrated it on the  authority of his father. (Abu’l-Husain Muslim said): His assertion that he has narrated  this Hadith on the authority of his father is not correct.

35|6506|  Chapter: The merit of this (supplication) : “O Allah, grant us the good in the world and good in  the hereafter and save us from the torment of hell”.  Qatada asked Anas which Supplication Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  frequently made. He said: The supplication that he (the Holy Prophet made very  frequently is this: “O Allah, grant us the good in this world and the good in the Hereafter  and save us from the torment of Hell-Fire.” He (Qatada) said that whenever Anas had to  supplicate he made this very supplication, and whenever he (intended) to make another  supplication he (inserted) this very supplication in that.

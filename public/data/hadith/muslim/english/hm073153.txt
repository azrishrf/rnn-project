7|3153|  Chapter: Eminence of Medina, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) showered  blessings upon it. Its sacredness and unlawfulness of hunting and lopping of trees and  demarcation its precincts.  Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as  saying: Ibrahim declared Mecca as sacred; I declare Medina, that between the two  mountains, as inviolable. No tree should be lopped and no game is to be molested.

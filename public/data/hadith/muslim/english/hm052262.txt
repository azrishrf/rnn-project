5|2262|  Chapter: Disapproval of begging from people.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Miskin is  not he who is dismissed with one or two dates, and with one morsel or two morsels. (In  fact) miskin is he who abstains (from begging). Read if you so desire (the verse): “They  beg not of men importunately)” (ii. 273). This Hadith has been narrated through another  chain of transmitters.

41|7024|  Chapter: The appearance of the Dajjal and his stay upon the earth and the descent of Jesus  and his killing him (Dajjal) and the departure of good people of strong conviction and the  survival of the wicked people and the worship of idols and the blowing of the trumpet and the  raising up from the graves.  Ya’qub b. ‘Asim b. Urwa b. Mas’ud reported: I heard a person saying to ‘Abdullah b.  Amr: You say that the Last Hour would come at such and such time, whereupon he  said: I had made up my mind that I would not narrate anything to you. I only said: But  you would soon see after some time a very significant affair, for example the burning of  the House (Ka’ba). Shu’ba said like this and ‘Abdullah b Amr reported Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said: The Dajjal would appear in my  Ummah. And in another hadith (the words are): None would survive who would have  even a speck of faith in his heart, but he would be dead. Muhammad b. ja’far reported  that Shu’ba narrated to him this hadith many a time and I also read it out to him many a  time.

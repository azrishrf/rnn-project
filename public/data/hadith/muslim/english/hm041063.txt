4|1063|  Chapter: Prayer in a single garment.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I have  been commissioned with words which are concise but comprehensive in meaning; I  have been helped by terror (in the hearts of enemies): and while I was asleep I was  brought the keys of the treasures of the earth which were placed in my hand. And Abfi  Huraira added: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has left (for his  heavenly home) and you are now busy in getting them.

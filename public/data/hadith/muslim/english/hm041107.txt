4|1107|  Chapter: It is allowable to curse Satan during prayer and seek the protection (of the  Lord) and minor acts (of commission) in prayer.         Abu Qatadi reported: I saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saying the  prayer while he was carrying Umama, daughter of Zainab, daughter of the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) and Abu’l-‘As b. al-Rabi’. When he stood up, he took  her up and when he prostrated he put her down, Yahya said: Malik replied in the  affirmative.

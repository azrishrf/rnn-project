1|391|  Chapter: Pertaining to the words of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him): “I  would be the first among people to Intercede in the Paradise and among the Apostles I  would have the largest following”.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: There  was for every apostle a prayer with which he prayed for his Ummah and it was granted  to him; but I wish, if Allah so wills, to defer my prayer for the intercession of my Ummah  on the Day of Resurrection.

9|3501|  Chapter: Mere giving of option of divorce to women does not make divorce effective,  but when it is really intended.  Masruq reported: I do not mind if I give option to my wife (to get divorce) once, hundred  times, or thousand times after (knowing it) that she has chosen me (and would never  seek divorce). I asked ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) (about it) and she said: Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave us the option, but did it imply divorce?

23|5070|  Chapter: Desirability of extracting stones from the dates and of the guest’s invoking blessing for  the host.  ‘Abdullah b. Busr reported: AUah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to my  father and we brought to him a meal and a preparation from dates, cheese and butter.  He ate out of that. He was then given dates which he ate but he placed their stones  between his fingers, and he joined his forefinger and middle finger. Shu’ba reported: I  think that this hadith God’s willing also contains (these words): Putting of date stones  between two fingers. Then a drink was brought for him and he drank it, and then gave it  to one who was on his right side. He (the narrator) said: My father took hold of the rein  of his riding animal and requested him to supplicate for us. Thereupon he said: O Allah.  bless them in what Thou hast provided them as a sustenance; and forgive them and  have mercy upon them.

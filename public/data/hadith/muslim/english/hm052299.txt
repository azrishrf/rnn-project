5|2299|  Chapter: Bestowal upon one who is firm in faith.         Miswar b. Makhrama reported: Some cloaks were presented to the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him). My father Makhrama said to me: Come along with me to him;  perhaps we may be able to get anything out of that (stock of cloaks). My father stood at  the door and began to talk. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) recognised  him by his voice and came out and there was a cloak with him, and he was showing its  beauties and saying: I kept it for you, I kept it for you.

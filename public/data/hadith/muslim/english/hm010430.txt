1|430|  Chapter: This Ummah (Ummah of Islam) would constitute half of the inhabitants of  Paradise.  Abu Sa’id reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Allah, the  High and Glorious, would say: O Adam I and he would say: At Thy service, at thy beck  and call, O Lord, and the good is in Thy Hand. Allah would say: Bring forth the group of  (the denizens of) Fire. He (Adam) would say: Who are the denizens of Hell? It would be  said: They are out of every thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine. He (the Holy  Prophet) said: It is at this juncture that every child would become white-haired and every  pregnant woman would abort and you would see people in a state of intoxication, and  they would not be in fact intoxicated but grievous will be the torment of Allah. He (the  narrator) said: This had a very depressing effect upon them (upon the companions of  the Holy Prophet) and they said: Messenger of Allah, who amongst us would be (that  unfortunate) person (who would be doomed to Hell)? He said: Good tidings for you,         Yajuj Majuj would be those thousands (who would be the denizens of Hell) and a  person (selected for Paradise) would be amongst you. He (the narrator) further reported  that he (the Messenger of Allah) again said: By Him in Whose Hand is thy life, I hope  that you would constitute one-fourth of the inhabitants of Paradise. We extolled Allah  and we glorified (Him). He (the Holy Prophet) again said: BY Him in Whose Hand is my  life, I wish you would constitute one-third of the inhabitants of Paradise. We extolled  Allah and Glorified (Him). He (the Holy Prophet) again said: By Him in Whose Hand is  my life, I hope that you would constitute half of the inhabitants of Paradise. Your  likeness among the people is the likeness of a white hair on the skin of a black ox or a  strip on the foreleg of an ass.

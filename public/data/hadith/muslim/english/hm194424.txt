19|4424|  Chapter: The persecution of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) at the hands of the  infidels and hypocrites.  It has been narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah that, the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) turned his face towards the Ka’ba and invoked God’s imprecations  upon six men of the Quraish, among whom were Abu Jahl. Umayya b. Khalaf, Utba b.  Rabi’a, Shaiba b. Rabi’a and ‘Uqba b. Abu Mu’ait I swear by God that I saw them lying  slain in the battlefield of Badr. It being a hot day, their complexion had changed  (showing signs of decay).

6|2460|  Chapter: Sexual Intercourse is completely forbidden during the day in the month of Ramadhan.  This Hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of  transmitters that a person broke fast in Ramadan whereupon the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) commanded him to free a slave (as an atonement), and the  rest of the Hadith is the same as narrated by Ibn Uyaina.

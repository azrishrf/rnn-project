4|1121|  Chapter: It is forbidden to remove pebbles and smooth the ground while engaged in  prayer.  Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw some  sputum in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque. He turned towards people and said:  How Is it that someone amongst you stands before his Lord and then spits out in front of  Him? Does any one of you like that he should be made to stand in front of someone and  then spit at his face? So when any one of you spits, he must spit on his left side under  his foot. But if he does not find (space to spit) he should do like this. Qasim (one of the  narrators) spat in his cloth and then folded it and rubbed it.

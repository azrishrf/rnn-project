7|2848|  Chapter: What is essential for him who enters into the state of Ihram for Hajj and then  comes to Mecca for circumambulation and running.  Amr b. Dinar said: We asked Ibn Umar about a person who came for Umra and  circumambulated the House, but he did not run between al-Safa’ and al-Marwa, whether  he is allowed to (put off Ihram) and have intercourse with his wife. He replied: Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) circumambulated the House seven times and  offered two rak’ahs of prayer after staying (at ‘Arafat), and ran between al-Safa and al- Marwa seven times. “Verily there is in Allah’s Messenger a model pattern for you”  (xxxill. 21).

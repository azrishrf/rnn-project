4|1062|  Chapter: Prayer in a single garment.  Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I have  been given superiority over the other prophets in six respects: I have been given words  which are concise but comprehensive in meaning; I have been helped by terror (in the  hearts of enemies): spoils have been made lawful to me: the earth has been made for  me clean and a place of worship; I have been sent to all mankind and the line of  prophets is closed with me.

19|4347|  Chapter: Faiâ€™ (property taken from the enemy without a formal war).  It has been narrated on the authority of Umar, who said: The properties abandoned by  Banu Nadir were the ones which Allah bestowed upon His Apostle for which no  expedition was undertaken either with cavalry or camelry. These properties were  particularly meant for the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). He would meet the  annual expenditure of his family from the income thereof, and would spend what  remained for purchasing horses and weapons as preparation for Jihad.

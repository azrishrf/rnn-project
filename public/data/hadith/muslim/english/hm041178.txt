4|1178|  Chapter: It is forbidden to cry out for finding out the lost thing in the mosque.  ‘Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led  us five (rak’ahs in prayer). We said: Messenger of Allah, has the prayer been extended?  He said: What is the matter? They said: You have said five (rak’ahs). He (the Holy  Prophet) said: Verily I am a human being like you. I remember as you remember and I  forget just as you forget. He then performed two prostrations as (compensation of)  forgetfulness.

18|4255|  Chapter: It is forbidden to ask many questions, and wasting of wealth.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Verily  Allah likes three things for you and He disapproves three things for you. He is pleased  with you that you worship Him and associate nor anything with Him, that you hold fast  the rope of Allah, and be not scattered; and He disapproves for you irrelevant talk,  persistent questioning on the wasting of wealth.

4|1653|  Chapter: He who fears that he would not be able to observe (Tahajjud) prayer at the end of  night should observe Witr in the first part of it.  Jabir reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was asked about the  prayer which was most excellent. He said: That in which the standing is longer. (This  Hadith is narrated by another chain of transmitters too.)

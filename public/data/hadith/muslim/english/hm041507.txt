4|1507|  Chapter: Praying in houses when it rains.  Anas b. Sirin reported: We met Anas b. Malik as he came to Syria at a place known as  â€˜Ain-al-Tamar and saw him observing prayer on the back of his donkey with his face  turned in that direction. (Hammam one of the narrators) pointed towards the left of  Qibla, so I said to him: I find you observing prayer towards the side other than that of  Qibla. Upon this he said: Had I not seen the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) doing like this, I would not have done so at all.

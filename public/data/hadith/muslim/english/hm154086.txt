15|4086|  Chapter: How should the masters treat their slaves and expiation if they show high- handedness.         Abu Mas’ud al-Badri reported: I was beating my slave with a whip when I heard a voice  behind me: Understand, Abu Masud; but I did not recognise the voice due to intense  anger. He (Abu Mas’ud) reported: As he came near me (I found) that he was the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he was saying: Bear in mind, Abu  Mas’ud; bear in mind. Abu Mas’ud. He (Aba Maslad) said: threw the whip from my hand.  Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Bear in mind, Abu Mas’ud; verily Allah has more  dominance upon you than you have upon your slave. I (then) said: I would never beat  my servant in future.

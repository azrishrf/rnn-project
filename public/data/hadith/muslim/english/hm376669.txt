37|6669|  Chapter: Throwing of non-believers in hell-fire for believers as Divine Grace and Mercy.  Safwan b. Muhriz reported that a person said to Ibn ‘Umar: How did you hear Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying something about intimate  conversation? He said: I heard him say: A believer will be brought to his Lord, the  Exalted and Glorious, on the Day of Resurrection and He would place upon him His veil  (of Light) and make him confess his faults and say: Do you recognise (your faults)? He  would say: My Lord, I do recognise (them). He (the Lord) would say: I concealed them  for you in the world. And today I forgive them. And he would then be given the Book  containing (the account of his) good deeds. And so far as the non-believers and  hypocrites are concerned, there would be general announcement about them before all         creation telling them that these (people, i.e. non-believers and hypocrites) told a lie  about Allah.

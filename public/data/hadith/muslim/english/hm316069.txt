31|6069|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Abdullah b. Salam (Allah be pleased with him).  Qais b. ‘Ubaida reported: I was (sitting) in a company in which there were (besides  others) Sa’d b. Malik and Ibn ‘Umar that ‘Abdullah b. Saliim happened to pass (by that  side). They (the people sitting in that company) said: He is a person from amongst the  dwellers of Paradise. I stood up and said to him: They say such and such (thing about  you), whereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, it is not meet for them to say (anything) of  which They have no knowledge. Verily I saw as if a pillar had been raised in a green  garden and there had been fixed at its (upper) end a handhold and there was a helper  at its base. It was said to me: Climb up. So I climbed up and caught hold of the hail- hold. I narrated (the contents of this dream) to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him), whereupon he said: ‘Abdullah would die in a state that he would be catching hold  of the firmest handhold (he would die holding fast to the faith).             HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

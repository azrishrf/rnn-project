4|1665|  Chapter: Exhortation to supplicate and make mention (of Allah) at the end of the night and its  acceptance by the Lord.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who  prayed on the Lailat-ul-Qadr (the Majestic Night) knowing that it is (the same night). I  (believe) that he (the Holy Prophet also) said: (He who does) it with faith and seeking  reward (from Allah), his sins would be forgiven.

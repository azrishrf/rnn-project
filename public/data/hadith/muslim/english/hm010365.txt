1|365|  Chapter: The lowest of the ranks in Paradise.  Abu Dharr reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I know the  last of the inhabitants of Paradise to enter it and the last of the inhabitants of Hell to  come out of it. He is a man who would be brought on the Day of Resurrection and it will  be said: Present his minor sins to him, and withhold from him his serious Sins. Then the  minor sins would be placed before him, and it would be said: On such and such a day  you did so and so and on such and such a day you did so and so. He would say: Yes. It  will not be possible for him to deny, while he would be afraid lest serious sins could be  presented before him. It would be said to him: In place of every evil deed you will have  good deed He will say: My Lord ! I have done things I do not see here. I indeed saw the  Messenger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were exposed.

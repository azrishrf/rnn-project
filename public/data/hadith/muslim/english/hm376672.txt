37|6672|  Chapter: Pertaining to the repentance of Ka’b b. Malik and his companions.  It is reported on the authority of Abdullah b. K’ab and he was the guide of Ka’b as he  lost his eyesight and he was the greatest scholar amongst his people and he retained in  his mind many ahadith of the Companions of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him). He said: I heard my father Ka’b b. Malik, and he has one of those three whose  repentance was accepted (by Allah). He transmitted that He never lagged behind  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from any expedition that he undertook  except two expeditions; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the tradition narrated  through another chain of transmitters the words are: “That Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) set out on an expedition with a large number of persons more than  ten thousand and this could not be recorded in the census register.”

6|2596|  Chapter: Forbiddance to observe perpetual fast and excellence of observing fast on alternate  days.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as  saying: The best fasting in the eye of Allah is that of David, for he fasted for half of the  age (he fasted on alternate days), and the best prayer in the eye of Allah, the Exalted  and Majestic, is that of David (peace be upon him), for he slept for half of the night and  then stood for prayer and then again slept. He prayed for one-third of the night after  midnight. He (the narrator) said: I asked ‘Amr b. Dinar whether ‘Amr b. Aus said that he  stood for prayer one-third of the night after midnight. He said: Yes.

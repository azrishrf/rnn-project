30|5671|  Chapter: The extreme love of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for his Umma, and  his extreme anxiety to warn them against that which is a source of trouble to them.  Hammam b. Munabbih reported: Abu Huraira reported us some ahadith from Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) amongst many, (and) one is this that Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be  upon  him)  said:  A  person  lit  fire  and  when  the  atmosphere  was  aglow,  moths  and  insects  began to fall into the fire, but I am there to hold them back, but they are plunging into it despite  my efforts, and he further added: That is your example and mine. I am there to hold you back  from fire and to save you from it, but you are plunging into it despite my efforts.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

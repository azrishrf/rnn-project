Samura reported: A man asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon  him) whether he should perform ablution after (eating) mutton. He (the Messenger of  Allah) said: Perform ablution it you so desire, and if you do not wish, do not perform it.  He (again) asked: Should I perform ablution (after eating) camel’s flesh? He said: Yes,  perform ablution (after eating) camel’s flesh. He (again) said: May I say prayer in the  sheepfolds? He (the Messenger of Allah) said: Yes. He (the narrator) again said: May I  say prayer where camels lie down? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No.

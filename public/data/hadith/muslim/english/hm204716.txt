20|4716|  Chapter: Saying of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him): “A group of people from  my Umma will always remain on the right path and continue to be triumphant.’ their  opponents shall not be able to do them any harm.  It has been narrated on the authority of Mughira who said: I heard the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) say: A group of people from my Umma will continue to  be triumphant over the people until the Command of Allah overtakes them while they  are still triumphant. The same tradition has been narrated through another chain of  transmitters on the same authority.

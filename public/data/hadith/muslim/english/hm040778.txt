4|778|  Chapter: The reciting of Takbir at the time of bowing and rising in prayer except rising after  Rukuâ€™ when it is said: Allah listened to him who praised Him.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: One is  not credited with having observed the prayer without the recitation (of al-Fatiha). So said  Abu Huraira: (The prayer in which) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  recited in a loud voice, we also recited that loudly for you (and the prayer in which) he  recited inwardly we also recited inwardly for you (to give you a practical example of the  prayer of the Holy Prophet).

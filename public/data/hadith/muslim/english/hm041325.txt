4|1325|  Chapter: The severity (of punishment) in missing the â€˜Asr prayer.  Umara b. Ruwaiba reported on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: He who said prayer before the rising of the sun and its  setting would not enter the fire (of Hell), and there was a man from Basra (sitting)  beside him who said: Did you hear it from the Apostle of Allah (way peace be upon         him)? He said: Yes, I bear witness to it. The man from Basra said: I bear witness that I  did hear from the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) saying it from the place that  you heard from him.

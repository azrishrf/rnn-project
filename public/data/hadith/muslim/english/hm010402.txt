I cannot avail you at all against Allah; O Abbas b. ‘Abd al- Muttalib, I cannot  avail you at all against Allah; O Safiya (aunt of the Messenger of Allah), I cannot avail  you at all against Allah; O Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, ask me whatever you like,  but I cannot avail you at all against Allah.

7|2854|  Chapter: Concerning Tamattul in Hajj.  Muslim al-Qurri reported: I asked Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) about  Tamattu’ in Hajj and he permitted it, whereas Ibn Zubair had forbidden it. He (Ibn  ‘Abbas) said: This is the mother of Ibn Zubair who states that Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) had permitted it, so you better go to her and ask her about it. He  (Muslim al-Qurri said): So we went to her and she was a bulky blind lady and she said:  Verily Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted it.

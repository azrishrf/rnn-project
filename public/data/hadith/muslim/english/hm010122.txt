1|122|  Chapter: Abusing a Muslim is an outrage and fighting against him is unbelief.  It is narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace and blessings be upon him) observed: Abusing a Muslim is an outrage and         fighting against him is unbelief. Zubaid said: I asked Abu Wa’il: Did you hear it from  Abdullah narrating if from the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon  him)? He replied: Yes. But there is mention of the talk between Zubaid and Abu Wa’il in  the hadith narrated by Shu’ba.

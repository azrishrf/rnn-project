32|6297|  Chapter: He upon whom Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) invoked curse  whereas he in fact did not deserve it, it would be a source of reward and mercy for him.         Anas b. Malik reported that there was an orphan girl with Umm Sulaim (who was the  mother of Anas). Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw that orphan girl and  said: O, it is you; you have grown young. May you not advance in years! That slave-girl  returned to Umm Sulaim weeping. Umm Sulaim said: O daughter, what is the matter  with you? She said: Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) has invoked curse upon  me that I should not grow in age and thus I would never grow in age, or she said, in my  (length) of life. Umm Sulaim went out wrapping her head-dress hurriedly until she met  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said to her: Umm Sulaim, what is the  matter with you? She said: Allah’s Apostle, you invoked curse upon my orphan girl. He  said: Umm Sulaim, what is that? She said: She (the orphan girl) states you have cursed  her saying that she might not grow in age or grow in life. Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) smiled and then said: Umm Sulaim, don’t you know that I have made this  term with my Lord. And the term with my Lord is that I said to Him: I am a human being  and I am pleased just as a human being is pleased and I lose temper just as a human  being loses temper, so for any person from amongst my Ummah whom I curse and he  in no way deserves it, let that, O Lord, be made a source of purification and purity and  nearness to (Allah) on the Day of Resurrection.

4|850|  Chapter: If the Imam arrives late and there is no danger of an unpleasant happening, another  Imam can be appointed to lead the prayer.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  Glorification of Allah is for men and clapping of hands is meant for women (if something  happens in prayer). Harmala added in his narration that Ibn Shihab told him: I saw some  of the scholars glorifying Allah and making a gesture.

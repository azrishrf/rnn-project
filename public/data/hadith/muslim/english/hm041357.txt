4|1357|  Chapter: Desirability of observing the morning prayer at earlier hour and that is the time when  there is darkness before dawn and the exposition about the length of recitation in it.  ‘Abu’l-‘Aliyat al-Bara reported: Ibn Ziyad delayed the prayer. ‘Abdullah b. Samit came to  me and I placed a chair for him and he sat in it and I made a mention of whit Ibn Ziyad  had done. He bit hit lips (as a sign of extreme anger and annoyance) and struck at my  thigh and said: I asked Abu Dharr as you have asked me, and he struck my thigh just as  I have struck your thigh, and said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) as you have asked me and he struck my thigh just as I have struck your thigh, and  he (the Holy Prophet) said: Observe prayer at its prescribed time, and if you can say  prayer along with them. do so, and do not say. “I have observed prayer and so I shall  not pray.”

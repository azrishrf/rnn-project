31|6038|  Chapter: The merits of Sa’d b. Mu’adh (Allah be pleased with him).         This hadith has been reported on the authority of Shu’ba combining the two chains of  transmitters. Anas b Malik reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  was presented a garment of sundus and he prohibited the use of silk. The persons  admired it, whereupon he said: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, the  kerchiefs of Sa’d b. Mu’adh in Paradise are better than this.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

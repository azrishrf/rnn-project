31|5894|  Chapter: The excellent qualities of ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Abdullah b. ‘Umar reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I  saw (in a dream) as if I was drawing water with a leathern bucket on a wooden pulley.  There came Abu Bakr and he drew out a bucketful or two and as he drew out, some  weakness (was perceived in it) (may Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, forgive him). Then  Umar came in order to serve water -and the bucket was changed into a large leather  bucket and I did not see such a wonderful man amongst persons (drawing water) and  he went on serving water to the people until they were fully satisfied and then went to  their resting places.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

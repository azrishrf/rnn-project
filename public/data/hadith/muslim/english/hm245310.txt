24|5310|  Chapter: The women who are naked even in their dresses and who deviate from the  right path and lead their husbands astray.  AbU Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said this:  Two are the types of the denizens of Hell whom I did not see: people having flogs like  the tails of the ox with them and they would be beating people, and the women who  would be dressed but appear to be naked, who would be inclined (to evil) and make  their husbands incline towards it. Their heads would be like the humps of the camel  inclined to one side. They will not enter Paradise and they would not smell its odour  whereas its odour would be smelt from such and such distance.

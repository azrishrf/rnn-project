41|6913|  Chapter: The events foretold by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) about the last hour.  Abu Zaid (viz. Amr b. Akhtab) reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  led us in the dawn prayer and then mounted the pulpit and addressed us until it was  (time for the) noon prayer. He then came down the pulpit and observed prayer and then  again mounted the pulpit and again addressed us until it was time for the ‘Asr prayer.  He then again came down and observed the prayer and again pointed the pulpit and  addressed us until the sun was set and he informed (about) everything (pertaining to  turmoil) that lay hidden in the past and what lies in (the womb) of) the future and the  most learned amongst us is one who remembers them well

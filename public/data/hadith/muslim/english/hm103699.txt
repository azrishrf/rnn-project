10|3699|  Chapter: It is forbidden to sell fresh dates against dry dates, except in case of al-Araya.  Abdullah (b. Umar) (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) having forbidden Mazabana, and it implies that one should sell the  fresh fruits of his orchard (for dry fruits) or, if it is fresh dates, for dry dates with a  measure, or if it is grapes for raisins or if it is corn in the field for dry corn with a  measure He (the Holy Prophet) in fact forbade all such transactions. Qutaiba has  narrated it with a slight variation of words. This hadith has been narrated on the  authority of Nafi with another chain of transmitters.

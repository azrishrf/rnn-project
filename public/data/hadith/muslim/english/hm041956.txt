4|1956|  Chapter: Supplication in prayer for rain.         Anas b. Malik reported: The people were in the grip of famine during the lifetime of the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and (once) as the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) was delivering the sermon standing on the pulpit on Friday, a  bedouin stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, the animals died and the children  suffered starvation. The rest of the Hadith is the same (and the words are) that he (the  Holy Prophet) said: O Allah, send down rain in our suburbs but not on us. He (the  narrator) said: To whichever directions he pointed with his hands, the clouds broke up  and I saw Medina like the opening of a (courtyard) and the stream of Qanat flowed for  one month, and none came from any part (of Arabia) but with the news of heavy rainfall.

5|2335|  Chapter: It is forbidden to pay Zakat to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and  Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib.  Abu Dharr reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Verily there  would arise from my Ummah after me or soon after me a group (of people) who would  recite the Qar’an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass clean  through their religion just as the arrow passes through the prey, and they would never  come back to it. They would be the worst among the creation and the creatures. Ibn  Samit (one of the narrators) said: I met Rafi’ b. ‘Amr Ghifari, the brother of Al-Hakam  Ghifari and I said: What is this Hadith that I heard from Abu Dharr, i.e. so and so?-and  then I narrated that Hadith to him and said: I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him).

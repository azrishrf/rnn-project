4|1101|  Chapter: Sitting on the buttocks.  Jabir reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent me (on an  errand) while he was going to Banu Mustaliq. I came to him and he was engaged in  prayer on the back of his camel. I talked to him and he gestured to me With his hand,  and Zuhair gestured with his hand. I then again talked and he again (gestured to me  with his hand). Zuhair pointed with his hand towards the ground. I heard him (the Holy  Prophet) reciting the Qur’an and making a sign with his head. When he completed the  prayer he said: What have you done (with regard to that business) for which I sent you?  I could not talk with you but for the fact that I was engaged in prayer. Zuhair told that  Abu Zubair was sitting with his face turned towards Qibla (as he transmitted this  Hadith). Abu Zuhair pointed towards Banu Mustaliq with his hand and the direction to  which he pointed with his hand was not towards the Ka’ba.

42|7125|  Chapter: Sneezing and the disapproval of yawning.  Anas b. Malik reported that two persons sneezed in the presence of Allahâ€™s Messenger  (may peace be upon him). He (the Messenger of Allah) invoked mercy for one, and did  not invoke for the other. The one for whom he had not prayed said: So and so sneezed  and you said: May Allah have mercy upon you. I also sneezed but you did not utter  these words for me. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: That person praised Allah,  and you did not praise Allah.

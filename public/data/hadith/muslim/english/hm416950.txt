41|6950|  Chapter: The Last Hour would not come until a person would pass by a grave and wish that he  should have been the occupant of that grave because of this calamity.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The world  would not come to an end until a day would come to the people on which the murderer  would not know as to why he has killed and the slain would not know as to why he has  been murdered. It would be said: Why would It happen? To which he replied: It would  be because of general massacre and bloodshed. And the slaughterers and the slain  would be in Fire, and in the narration of Ibn Aban, the name of Abu Isma’il has been  mentioned.

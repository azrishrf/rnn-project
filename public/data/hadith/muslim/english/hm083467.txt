8|3467|  Chapter: Advice in regards to woman.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Woman has been created from a rib  and will in no way be straightened for you; so if you wish to benefit by her, benefit by her  while crookedness remains in her. And if you attempt to straighten her, you will break  her, and breaking her is divorcing her.

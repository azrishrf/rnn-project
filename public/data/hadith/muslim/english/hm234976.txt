23|4976|  Chapter: Permissibility to use Nabidh which is not strong and has not turned into Intoxicant.  Thumama (i.e. Ibn Hazn al-Qushairi) reported: I met ‘Aisha and asked her about Nabidh  (that was served to the Holy Prophet). ‘Aisha called an Abyssinian maid (servant) and  said: Ask her (about it) for it was he, who prepared the Nabidh for the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him). The Abyssinian (maid-servant) said: I prepared Nabidh  for him in a water-skin in the night and tied its mouth and then suspended it; and when it  was morning he (the Holy Prophet) drank from it.

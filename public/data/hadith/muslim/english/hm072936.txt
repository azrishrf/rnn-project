7|2936|  Chapter: The pilgrim should continue to pronounce Talbiya until the stoning of Jamrat  al-‘Aqaba on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu’l-Hajja).  ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Yazid and al-Aswad b. Yazid reported: We heard ‘Abdullah b.  Mas’ud saying to the gathering of people (at Muzdalifa) that he had heard Talbiya from  him, upon whom Surah al-Baqara was revealed, at this very place. And so he (‘Abdullah  b. Mas’ud) pronounced Talbiya and we also pronounced it with him.

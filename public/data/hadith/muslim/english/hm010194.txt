1|194|  Chapter: Serious prohibition of letting down the lower garment: of laying obligation of  selling goods by false oaths, and description of those three (persons) with whom Allah  would not speak on the Day of Resurrection nor would He see towards them nor would  absolve them, and for them is a painful chastisement.  Bishr b. Khalid has narrated this hadith on the authority of Sulaiman with the same  chain of transmitters with this addition: Allah shall neither speak nor look at nor absolve  then, and there is a tormenting punishment for them.

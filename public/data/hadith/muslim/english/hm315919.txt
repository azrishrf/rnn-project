31|5919|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Ali b. Abi Talib (Allah be pleased with him).  Salama b. Akwa’ reported that it was ‘Ali whom Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) left behind him (in the charge of his family and the Islamic State) on the occasion  of the campaign of Khaibar, and his eyes were inflamed and he said: Is it for me to  remain behind Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? So he went forth and  rejoined Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and on the evening of that night (after  which) next morning Allah granted victory. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  said: I will certainly give this standard to a man whom Allah and His Messenger love or  he said: Who loves Allah or His Messenger and Allah will grant him victory through him,  and, lo, we saw ‘Ali whom we least expected (to be present on that occasion). They (the  Companions) said: Here is ‘Ali. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  gave him the standard. Allah granted victory at his hand.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

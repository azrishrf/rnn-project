39|6719|  Chapter: Pertaining to the words of Allah: “Nay, but verily man is inordinate, because he looks  upon himself as self-sufficient”.  Masruq reported: We were sitting in the company of Abdullah and he was lying on the  bed that a person came and said: Abd Abd al-Rabmin, a story-teller at the gates of  Kinda says that the verse (of the Qur’an) which deals with the “smoke” implies that  which is about to come and it would hold the breath of the infidels and would inflict the  believers with cold. Thereupon Abdullah got up and said in anger. O people, fear Allah  and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say which he does not  know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He has the best  knowledge amongst all of you. It does not behove him to say that which he does not  know. Allah has the best knowledge of it. Verily Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said to  His Prophet (may peace be upon him) to state: “I do not ask from you any remuneration  and I am not the one to put you in trouble,” and when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) saw people turning back(from religion) he said: O Allah, afflict them with         seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were afflicted with famine by  which they were forced to eat everything until they were obliged to eat the hides and the  dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them looked towards the sky and he  found a smoke. And Abu Sufyan came and he said: Muhammad, you have come to  command us to obey Allah and cement the ties of blood-relation whereas your people  are undone; supplicate Allah for them. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:  “Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke from the sky which would envelop  people and that would be grievous torment” up to the words: “you are going to return to  (evil).” (if this verse implied the torment of the next life) could the chastisement of the  next (life) be averted (as the Qur’an states): On the day when We seize (them) with the  most violent seizing; surely We shall exact retribution” (xliv. 16)? The seizing (in the  hadith) implies that of the Day of Badr. And so far as the sign of smoke, seizing,  inevitability and signs of Rome are concerned, they have become things of the past  now.

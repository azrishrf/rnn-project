41|6924|  Chapter: Pertaining to the conquest of Constantinople and the appearance of the Dajjal and  descent of Jesus son of Mary (Jesus Christ).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The Last  Hour would not come until the Romans would land at al-A’maq or in Dabiq. An army  consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of the earth at that time will come from  Medina (to counteract them). When they will arrange themselves in ranks, the Romans  would say: Do not stand between us and those (Muslims) who took prisoners from  amongst us. Let us fight with them; and the Muslims would say: Nay, by Allah, we would  never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may fight them. They will then  fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A third  (part of the army). which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah’s eye, would  be killed and the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be  conquerors of Constantinople. And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of  war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan  would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your family. They would then come         out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would come to Syria, he would come out  while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks. Certainly,  the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of Mary would  descend and would lead them in prayer. When the enemy of Allah would see him, it  would (disappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to  confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by  his hand and he would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).

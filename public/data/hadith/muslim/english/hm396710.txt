39|6710|  Chapter: The feast for the inhabitants of paradise.  Abu al-Sa’id Khudri reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying  that the earth would turn to be one single bread on the Day of Resurrection and the  Almighty would turn it in His hand as one of you turns a loaf while on a journey. It would  be a feast arranged in the honour of the people of Paradise. He (the narrator) further  narrated that a person from among the Jews came and he said: Abu al-Qasim, may the  Compassionate Lord be pleased with you! May I inform you about the feast arranged in  honour of the people of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection? He said: Do it, of course.  He said: The earth would become one single bread. Then Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) looked towards us and laughed until his molar teeth became  visible. He then again said: May I inform you about that with which they would season  it? He said: Do it, of course. He said: Their seasoning would be balam and fish. The  Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: What is this balam?  He said: Ox and fish from whose excessive livers seventy thousand people would be  able to eat.  PARADISE AND HELL

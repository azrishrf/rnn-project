24|5246|  Chapter: Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.  ‘Aisha reported that Gabriel (peace be upon him) made a promise with Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) to come at a definite hour; that hour came but he  did not visit him. And there was in his hand (in the hand of Allah’s Apostle) a staff. He  threw it from his hand and said: Never has Allah or His messengers (angels) ever  broken their promise. Then he cast a glance (and by chance) found a puppy under his  cot and said: ‘Aisha, when did this dog enter here? She said: BY Allah, I don’t know He  then commanded and it was turned out. Then Gabriel came and Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) said to him: You promised me and I waited for you, but you  did not come, whereupon he said: It was the dog in your house which prevented me (to  come), for we (angels) do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.

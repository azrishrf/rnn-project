8|3290|  Chapter: Prohibition of one’s making the proposal of marriage when it has already been made  by one’s brother until he permits or gives her up.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) as having said this: Do not outbid in a sale in order to ensnare. No man  should enter into a transaction in which his brother has already entered, and no dweller  of the town should sell on behalf of the villager. And no man should make a proposal of  marriage which his brother has already made and no woman should ask for the divorce  of another (co-wife) in order to deprive her of what belongs to her.

5|2185|  Chapter: Getting of reward to Sadaqa for the dead given on his or her behalf.  Anas b. Malik is reported as saying: Abu Talha was the one among the Ansar of Medina  who possessed the largest property and among his property he valued most was his  garden known as Bairaha’ which was opposite the mosque, and the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) often visited it and he drank of its sweet water. When this  verse was revealed: “You will never attain righteousness till you give freely of what you  Have” (iii. 91), Abu Talha got up and, going to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him), said: Allah says in His Book: “You will never attain righteousness till you give  freely of what you love,” and the dearest of my property is Bairaha’ so I give it as  Sadaqa to God from Whom I hope for reward for it and the treasure with Allah; so spend  it, Messenger of Allah, on whatever purpose you deem it proper. The Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Bravo I that is profit earning property. I have heard  what you have said, but I think you should spend it on your nearest relatives. So Abu  Talha distributed it among the neatest relatives and his cousins on his father’s side.

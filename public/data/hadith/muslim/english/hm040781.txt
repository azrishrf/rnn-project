4|781|  Chapter: The reciting of Takbir at the time of bowing and rising in prayer except rising after  Ruku’ when it is said: Allah listened to him who praised Him.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) entered the  mosque and a person also entered therein and offered prayer, and then came and paid  salutation to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) returned his salutation and said: Go back and pray, for you  have not offered the prayer. He again prayed as he had prayed before, and came to the  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and saluted him. The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) returned the salutation and said: Go back and say prayer, for  you have not offered the prayer. This (act of repeating the prayer) was done three  times. Upon this the person said: By Him Who hast sent you with Truth, whatever better  I can do than this, please teach me. He (the Holy Prophet) said: When you get up to  pray, recite takbir, and then recite whatever you conveniently can from the Qur’an, then  bow down and remain quietly in that position, then raise yourself and stand erect; then  prostrate yourself and remain quietly in that attitude; then raise yourself and sit quietly;  and do that throughout all your prayers.

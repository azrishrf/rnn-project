22|4876|  Chapter: It is forbidden to sacrifice the animal for anyone besides Allah, the Exalted,  and curse upon one who does it.  Abu Tufail ‘Amir b. Withila reported: I was in the company of ‘Ali b. Abi Talib, when a  person came to him, and said: What was it that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) told you in secret? Thereupon he (Hadrat ‘Ali) was enraged and said: Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) did not tell me anything in secret that he hid from  people, except that he told me four things. He said: Commander of Faithful, what are  these? He said: Allah cursed him who cursed his father; Allah cursed him who sacrificed  for anyone besides Allah; and Allah cursed him who accommodates an innovator (in  religion) ; and Allah cursed him who changed the minarets (the boundary lines) of the  land.

20|4481|  Chapter: The people are subservient to the Quraish and the Caliphate is the right of the  Quraish.  It has been narrated on the authority of Jabir b. Samura that the Holy Prophet (may  peace be upon him) said: This order will continue to be dominant until there have been  twelve Caliphs. The narrator says: Then he said something which I could not  understand, and I said to my father: What did he say? My father told me that he said  that all of them (Caliphs) would be from the Quraish.

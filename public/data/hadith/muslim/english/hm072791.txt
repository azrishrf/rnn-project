7|2791|  Chapter: Types of Ihram- It is permissible to enter into the state of Ihram singularly for  the sake of Hajj or for tamattu’ bi’l-‘umra ila’l-Hajj or for both hajj and ‘umra together.  Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said: We, in the state of ihram, came with the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) for Hajj Mufrad (with the aim of Hajj only),  and ‘Aisha set out for Umra, and when we reached Sarif, she (Hadrat ‘Aisha) entered in  the state of monthly period; we proceeded on till we reached (Mecca) and  circumambulated the Ka’ba and ran between (al-Safa) and al-Marwa; and the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) commanded that one who amongst us  had no sacrificial animal with him should put off Ihram. We said: What does this “Putting  off” imply? He said: Getting out completely from the state of ihram, (so we put off  Ihram), and we turned to our wives and applied perfume and put on our clothes and we  were at a four night’s distance from ‘Arafa. And we again put on Ihram on the day of  Tarwiya (8th of Dhu’l-Hijja). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) and found her weeping, and said: What is the matter         with you? She said: The matter is that I have entered in the monthly period, and the  people had put off ihram, but I did not and I did not circumambulate the House, and the  people are going for Hajj now (but I can’t go), whereupon he said: It is the matter which  Allah has ordained for the daughters of Adam, so now take a bath and put on Ihram for  Hajj. She (‘Aisha) did accordingly, and stayed at the places of staying till the monthly  period was over. She then circumambulated the House, and (ran between) al-Safa and  al-Marwa. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: Now both your Hajj and ‘Umra are complete,  whereupon she said: I feel in my mind that I did not circumambulate the House till I  performed Hajj (I missed the circumambulation of ‘Umra). Thereupon he (Allah’s  Apostle) said: ‘Abd al-Rahman, take her to Tan’im (so as to enable her) to perform  Umra (separately), and it was the night at Hasba.

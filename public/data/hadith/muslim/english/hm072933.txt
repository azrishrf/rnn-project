7|2933|  Chapter: The pilgrim should continue to pronounce Talbiya until the stoning of Jamrat  al-‘Aqaba on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu’l-Hajja).  Ibn ‘Abbas narrated from al-Fadl b. Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) who sat behind  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that he (the Holy Prophet) said to the  people on the evening of ‘Arafa and on the morning to the gathering of people (at  Muzdalifa) as they were pushing on to proceed slowly. And he himself drove his she- camel with restraint until he entered Muhassir (it is a place in Mina), and further told  them to take up pebbles which were to be thrown at Jamra. And Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) continued pronouncing Talbiya till he stoned the Jamra. This  Hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abd Zubair with the same chain of  transmitters but with this variation that in the Hadith no mention is made of (this) that  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) continued pronouncing Talbiya till he  stoned the Jamra, and he made this addition in his Hadith: “The Apostle (may peace be  upon him) pointed with his hand how a person should catch hold of pebbles (in order to  throw them).”

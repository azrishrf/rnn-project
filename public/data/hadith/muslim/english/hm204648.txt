20|4648|  Chapter: One who is killed in the way of Allah will have all his sins blotted out except  debt.  Another version of the tradition differently transmitted begins with the words: “A man  came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he was sitting on the  pulpit... He said: What do you find if I strike with the sword?” (The rest of the tradition is  the same as the previous one.)

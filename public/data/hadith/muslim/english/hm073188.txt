7|3188|  Chapter: Medina wipes out evil from it and its other names are Tabba and Taiba.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: A time will come for the people (of Medina) when a man will invite  his cousin and any other near relation: Come (and settle) at (a place) where living is  cheap, come to where there is plenty, but Medina will be better for them; would they  know it! By Him in Whose Hand is my life, none amongst them would go out (of the city)  with a dislike for it, but Allah would make his successor in it someone better than be.         Behold. Medina is like furnace which eliminates from it the impurities. And the Last Hour  will not come until Medina banishes its evils just as a furnace eliminates the impurities  of iron.

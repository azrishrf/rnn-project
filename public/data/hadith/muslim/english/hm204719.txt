It his been narrated on the authority of Umair b. Umm Hani who said: I heard Mu’awiya  say (while delivering a sermon from the pulpit) that he heard the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) say: A group of people from my Umma will continue to obey  Allah’s Command, and those who desert or oppose them shall not be able to do them  any harm. They will be dominating the people until Allah’s Command is executed (i.e.  Resurrection is established).

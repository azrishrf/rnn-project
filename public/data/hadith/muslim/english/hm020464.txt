2|464|  Chapter: The washing of feet properly is indispensable in Wudu.  Salim, the freed slave of Shaddad, said: I came to ‘Aisha, the wife of the Holy Prophet  (may peace be upon him), on the day when Sa’db. Abi Waqqas died. ‘Abd al-Rahman  b. Abu Bakr also came there and he performed ablution in her presence. She (Hadrat  ‘Aisha) said: Abd al-Rahman, complete the ablution as I heard the Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) say: Woe to the heels because of hell-fire.

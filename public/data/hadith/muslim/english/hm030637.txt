3|637|  Chapter: The quantity of water that is desirable for a bath because of sexual  intercourse, bathing of the male and female with one vessel in the same condition and  washing of one of them with the left-over of the other.  Safina reported that Abd Bakr, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (way peace be  upon him), observed: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took a bath         with one Sa’ of water and performed ablution with one Mudd (of water); and in the  Hadith narrated by Ibn Hujr the words are: One Mudd sufficed for his (Holy Prophet’s)  ablution. And Ibn Hujr said that (his Shaikh) Isma’il was much advanced in age, and it  was because of this that he could not fully rely on him for this tradition.

33|6428|  Chapter: Everyone is born according to his true nature and the command pertaining to the  demise of the children of the infidels and of the children of the Muslims.  Abu Huraira reported from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upom him) many ahadith  and one amongst them is that he is reported to have said: An infant is born according to  his (true) nature. It is his parents Who make him a Jew, a Christian, just as a she-camel  gives birth to its young ones. Do you find any deficiency in their limbs? You cut their  ears (i.e. after birth). They (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: What is your  opinion about him who dies in infancy? Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) said: It is Allah alone Who knows best what they would be doing.

7|3014|  Chapter: Excellence of making a halt at al Muha’ab, on the day of Nahr, and observing  prayer there.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) said to us as we were at Mina: We would observe halt tomorrow at-Khaif of  Banu Kinanah, where (the polytheists) had taken an oath on unbelief, and that was that  the Quraish and Banu Kinanah had, pledged against Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib  that they would neither marry nor do any transaction with them unless they deliver  Allah’s Messenger (way peace be upon him) to them. And (this pledge was) taken at  this (place) Muhassab.

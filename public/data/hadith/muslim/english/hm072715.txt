7|2715|  Chapter: Hunting is forbidden for one who is in the state of Ihram.  Abdullah b. Abi Qatada reported that Abu Qatada was among the party of those who  had entered upon the state of Ihram whereas he was not. The rest of the Hadith is the  same (and herein it is also narrated): “He (the Holy Prophet) said: Did any person  among you point to him (to hunt) or command him (in any form)? They said: Messenger  of Allah, not at all. Thereupon he said: Then eat it.”

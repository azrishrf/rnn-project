6|2384|  Chapter: The month may consist of twenty-nine days.  Zuhri reported that (once) the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) took an oath  that he would not go to his wives for one Month. Zuhri said that ‘Urwa narrated to him  from ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) that she said: When twenty-nine nights were  over, which I had counted, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to  me (he came to me first of all). I said: Messenger of Allah, you had taken an oath that  you would not come to us for a month, whereas you have come after twenty nine days  which I have counted. Whereupon he said: The month may also consist of twenty-nine  days.

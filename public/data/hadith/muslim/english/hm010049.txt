1|49|  Chapter: He who meets his Lord with implicit faith would enter Heaven and fire would  be forbidden to harm him.  It is narrated on the authority of Aswad b. Hilal that he heard Muâ€™adh say this: The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called, me and I replied to him. He (the  Holy Prophet) said: Do you know the right of Allah upon the people? and then followed  the hadith (mentioned above).

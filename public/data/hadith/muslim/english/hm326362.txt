32|6362|  Chapter: The merit of according benevolent treatment to daughters.  ‘Aisha, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), said: A woman came to me  along with her two daughters. She asked me for (charity) but she found nothing with me  except one date, so I gave her that. She accepted it and then divided it between her two  daughters and herself ate nothing out of that. She then got up and went out, and so did  her two daughters. (In the meanwhile) Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) visited  me and I narrated to him her story. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  said: He who is involved (in the responsibility) of (bringing up) daughters, and he  accords benevolent treatment towards them, there would be protection for him against  Hell-Fire.

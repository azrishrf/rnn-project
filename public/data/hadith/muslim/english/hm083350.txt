8|3350|  Chapter: When one is invited to a wedding feast, one should accept it.  Sufyan reported: I said to Zuhri: Abu Bakr, what does this hadith mean: “The worst kind  of food is at a wedding feast of the rich”? He laughed and said: The food served in the  feast given by the rich is not worst (in itself). Sufyan said: My father was rich, so I felt  disturbed when I heard this hadith, so I asked Zuhri who said: I heard from ‘Abd al- Rahman al-Alraj that he heard Abu Huraira (Allah he pleased with him) say: The worst  kind of food is that served at the wedding feast. The rest of the hadith is the same.

23|4991|  Chapter: Command pertaining to the covering of vessels, and tightening (the mouths) of  waterskins, etc.  Jabir reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Cover vessels,  water-skins, close the doors and extinguish the lamps, for the Satan does not loosen  the water-skin, does not open the door and does not uncover the vessels. And if one  amongst you fails to find (something) to cover it well, he should cover it by placing (a  piece of) wood across it. Qutaiba did not mention the closing of the doors in the hadith  transmitted by him.

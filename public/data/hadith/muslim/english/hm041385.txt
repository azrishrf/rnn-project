4|1385|  Chapter: Excellence of praying the ‘Isha and morning prayers in congregation.  ‘Itban b. Malik reported: I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and  the rest of the Hadith is the same as narrated (above) except this that a man said:  Where is Malik b. Dukhshun or Dukhaishin, and also made this addition that Mahmud  said: I narrated this very Hadith to many people and among them was Abu Ayyub al- Ansari who said: I cannot think that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  could have said so as you say. He (the narrator) said: I took an oath that if I ever go to  ‘Itban. I would ask him about it. So I went to him and found him to be a very aged man,  having lost his eyesight, but he was the Imam of the people. I sat by his side and asked  about this Hadith and he narrated it In the same way as he had narrated it for the first  time. Then so many other obligatory acts and commands were revealed which we see  having been completed. So he who wants that he should not be deceived would not be  deceived.

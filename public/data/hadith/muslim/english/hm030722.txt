3|722|  Chapter: A Muslim is not defiled.  Abu Huraira reported that he met the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)on one  of the paths leading to Medina in a state of (sexual) defilement and he slipped away and  took a bath. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) searched for him and when  he came, he said to him: O Abu Huraira, where were you? He said: Messenger of Allah,  you met when I was (sexually) defiled and I did not like to sit in your company before  taking a bath. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  Hallowed be Allah, verily a believer is never defiled.

4|753|  Chapter: He who hears the Adhin should respond like it, invoke blessings upon the Apostle  (may peace be upon him)and then beg for him the Wasila.  AbuHuraira reported the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: When  Satan hears the call to prayer, he turns back and breaks the wind so as not to bear the  call being made, but when the call is finished he turns round and distracts (the minds of  those who pray), and when he bears the Iqama he again runs away so as not to hear its  voice and when it subsides, he comes back and distracts (the minds of those who stand  for prayer).

8|3231|  Chapter: One who can support a wife should marry.  ‘Alqama reported: While I was walking with ‘Abdullah at Mina, ‘Uthman happened to  meet him. He stopped there and began to talk with him. Uthman said to him: Abu ‘Abd  al-Rahman, should we not marry you to a young girl who may recall to you some of the  past of your bygone days; thereupon he said: If you say so, Allah’s Messenger (May  peace be upon him) said: O young men, those among you who can support a wife  should marry, for it restrains eyes from casting (evil glances) and preserves one from  immorality; but those who cannot should devote themselves to fasting for it is a means  of controlling sexual desire.

19|4464|  Chapter: The number of wars waged by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Ishaq that ‘Abdullah b. Yazid went (out of  the city) with people for offering “Istisqa”‘ prayer (for rainfall). He offered two rak’ahs.  Then he prayed for rain. That day I met Zaid b. Arqam. There was only one man  between me and him (at that time). I asked him: How many military expeditions did the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) undertake? He said: Nineteen  expeditions. I asked him: On how many expeditions did you accompany him? He said:  On seventeen expeditions. I asked: Which was the first expedition he led? He  answered: Dhat-ul-Usair or ‘Ushair.

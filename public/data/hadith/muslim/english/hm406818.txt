40|6818|  Chapter: The haughty and the proud would Set into the fire of hell and the humble and meek  would get into Paradise.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There  was a dispute between the Hell and the Paradise and it (the Hell) said: The haughty and  the proud would find abode in me. And the Paradise said: The meek and the humble  would find their abode in me. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, (addressing  the Hell) said: You are (the means) of My punishment by which I punish those of My  servants whom I wish. (And addressing the Paradise) He said: You are only My Mercy  by means of which I shall show mercy to those whom I wish, but each one of you would  be full.  INTIMATES

1|398|  Chapter: He who died with unbelief would be (thrown) into the Fire, intercession would  be of no avail to him and the relationship of his favourites would not benefit him.  Anas reported: Verily, a person said: Messenger of Allah, where is my father? He said:  (He) is in the Fire. When he turned away, he (the Holy Prophet) called him and said:  Verily my father and your father are in the Fire.

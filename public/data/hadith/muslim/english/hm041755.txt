4|1755|  Chapter: Excellence of listening to the Qur’an and asking one who has memorised it  and to recite it from his memory and shedding tears while listening to the recitation and  deliberating over it.         Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Would  any one of you like, when he returns to his family, to find there three large, fat, pregnant  she-camels? We said: Yes. Upon this he said: Three verses that one of you recites in  his prayer are better for him than three large, fat, pregnant she-camels.

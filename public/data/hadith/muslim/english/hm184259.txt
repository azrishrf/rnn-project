18|4259|  Chapter: It is forbidden to ask many questions, and wasting of wealth.         Sha’bi reported that the scribe of al-Mughira b. Shu’ba said: Mu’awiya wrote to Mughira:  Write for me something which you heard from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him); and he wrote: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying.  Verily Allah disapproves three thingq for you: irrelevant talk, wasting of wealth and  persistent questioning.

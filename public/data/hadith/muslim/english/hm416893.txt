41|6893|  Chapter: The turmoil would come like rainfall.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There will  be soon a period of turmoil in which the one who sits will be better than one who stands  and the one who stands will be better than one who walks and the one who walks will  be better than one who runs. He who would watch them will be drawn by them. So he  who finds a refuge or shelter against it should make it as his resort.

4|1512|  Chapter: Permissibility of saying Nafl prayer on a riding beast while on a journey, in whatever  direction it turns.  Anas b. Malik reported: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) set out  on a journey before the sun declined (from the meridian), he delayed the noon prayer till  the afternoon prayer, and then dismounted (his ride) and combined them (noon and         afternoon prayers), but if the sun had declined before his setting out on a journey, he  observed the noon prayer and then mounted (the ride).

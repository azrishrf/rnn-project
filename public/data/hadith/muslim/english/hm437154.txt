43|7154|  Chapter: Not known.  Tariq b. Shihab reported that a Jew said to ‘Umar: If this verse were revealed in relation  to the Jews (i.e. “This day I have perfected your religion for you and have completed My  favours for you and have chosen for you al-Islam as religion”) we would have taken the  day of rejoicing on which this verse was revealed. Thereupon ‘Umar said: I know the  day on which it was revealed and the hour when it was revealed and where Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been when it was revealed. It was revealed  on the night of Friday and we were in ‘Arafat with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) at that time.

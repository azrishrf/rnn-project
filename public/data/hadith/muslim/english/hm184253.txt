18|4253|  Chapter: Judgment is to be pronounced on evidence, and one who is eloquent in his plea (may  win the case).  ‘Aisha reported that Hind came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said:  Messenger of Allah, by Allah, there was no other household upon the surface of the  earth than your household about which I cherished Allah bringing disgrace upon it, (and  now) there is no other household upon the surface of the earth than your household  about which I cherish Allah granting it honour. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  said: It is so, by Him in Whose Hand is my life She said: Allah’s Messenger, Abu Sufyan  is a niggardly person. Is there any harm for me if I spend upon his children out of his  wealth without his permission? Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  said: There is no harm for you if you spend upon them what is reasonable.

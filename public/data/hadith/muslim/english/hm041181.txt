4|1181|  Chapter: It is forbidden to cry out for finding out the lost thing in the mosque.  Abdullah reported: We prayed along with the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon  him) and he committed or omitted (something). Ibrahim said: By Allah, this is a         misgiving of mine only. We said: Messenger of Allah, is there something new about the  prayer? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No. We told him about what he had done. He (the  Holy Prophet) said: When a man commits or omits (something in prayer), he should  perform two prostrations, and he then himself performed two prostrations.

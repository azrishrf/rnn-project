He said to her something secretly and she wept. He  again said to her something secretly and she laughed. ‘Aisha further reported that she  said to Fatima: What is that which Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to  you secretly and you wept and then said to you something secretly and you laughed?  Thereupon she said: He informed me secretly of his death and so I wept. He then again  informed me secretly that I would be the first amongst the members of his family to  follow him and so I laughed.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

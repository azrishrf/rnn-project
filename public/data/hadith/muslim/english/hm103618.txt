10|3618|  Chapter: It is forbidden that one should enter into a transaction on which one’s brother  has already been negotiating, or one should purchase (in opposition) to one’s brother,  or one should cheat and retain milk in the under (in order to deceive the purchaser).  Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: A person should not enter into a transaction when his brother is  already making a transaction and he should not make a proposal of marriage when his  brother has already made a proposal except when lie gives permission.

4|2124|  Chapter: Funeral prayer in the mosque.  ‘Abbad b. ‘Abdullah b. Zubair reported on the authority of ‘Aisha that when Sa’d b. Abu  Waqqas died, the wives of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent message  to bring his bier into the mosque so that they should offer prayer for him. They (the  participants of the funeral) did accordingly, and it was placed in front of their apartments  and they offered prayer for him. It was brought out of the door (known as) Bab al-Jana’iz  which was towards the side of Maqa’id, and the news reached them (the wives of the  Holy Prophet) that the people bad criticised this (i.e. offering of funeral prayer in the  mosque) saying that it was not desirable to take the bier inside the mosque. This was  conveyed to ‘Aisha. She said: How hastily the people criticise that about which they  know little. They criticise us for carrying the bier in the mosque. The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) offered not the funeral prayer of Suhail b. Baida’ but in the  innermost part of the mosque.

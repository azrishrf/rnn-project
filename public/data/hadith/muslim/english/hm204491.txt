20|4491|  Chapter: Undesirability of getting a position of authority without necessity.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr who said: I said to the Holy Prophet  (may peace be upon him): Messenger of Allah, will you not appoint me to a public  office? He stroked my shoulder with his hand and said: Abu Dharr, thou art weak and  authority is a trust and on the Day of judgment it is a cause of humiliation and  repentance except for one who fulfils its obligations and (properly) discharges the duties  attendant thereon.

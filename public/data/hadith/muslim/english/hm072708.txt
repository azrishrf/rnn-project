7|2708|  Chapter: Hunting is forbidden for one who is in the state of Ihram.  Abu Qatada (Allah be pleased with him) reported that while he was with the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) on one of the highways of Mecca, he lagged behind  him (the Holy Prophet) along with companions who were in the state of Ihram, whereas  he was himself not Muhrim. He saw a wild ass. As he was mounting his horse he asked  his companions to pick up for him his whip (which had dropped) but they refused to do  so. He asked them to hand him over the spear, but they refused. He then himself took  hold of it and chased the wild ass and killed it. Some of the Companions of the Apostle  of Allah (way peace be upon him) ate (its meat), but some of them refused to do so.  They overtook the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and asked him about  it, and he said: It is a food which Allah provided you (so eat it).

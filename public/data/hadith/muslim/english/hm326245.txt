32|6245|  Chapter: Whenever a believer falls sick or is stricken with grief or something tike it,  there is a reward for him even if it is pricking of a thorn.  ‘Ata’ b. Abi Rabih said: Ibn Abbas said to me: May I show you a woman of Paradise? I  said: Yes. He said: Here is this dark-complexioned woman. She came to Allah’s Apostle  (may peace be upon him) and said: I am suffering from falling sickness and I become  naked; supplicate Allah for me, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Show endurance  as you can do and there would be Paradise for you and, if you desire, I supplicate Allah  that He may cure you. She said: I am prepared to show endurance (but the unbearable  trouble is) that I become naked, so supplicate Allah that He should not let me become  naked, so he supplicated for her.

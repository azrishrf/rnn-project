40|6793|  Chapter: The first group that would be admitted to Paradise would be like the face of the full  moon and the description of their qualities and their spouses.  Muhammad reported that some (persons) stated with a sense of pride and some  discussed whether there would be more men in Paradise or more women. It was upon  this that Abu Huraira reported that Abuâ€™l Qasim (the Holy Prophet) (may peace be upon  him) said: The (members) of the first group to get into Paradise would have their faces  as bright as full moon during the night, and the next to this group would have their faces  as bright as the shining stars in the sky, and every person would have two wives and  the marrow of their shanks would glimmer beneath the flesh and there would be none  without a wife in Paradise.

32|6265|  Chapter: The prohibition of backbiting.         Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do you  know what is backbiting? They (the Companions) said: Allah and His Messenger know  best. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Backbiting implies your talking about your  brother in a manner which he does not like. It was said to him: What is your opinion  about this that if I actually find (that failing) in my brother which I made a mention of? He  said: If (that failing) is actually found (in him) what you assert, you in fact backbited him,  and if that is not in him it is a slander.  OF RELATIONSHIP

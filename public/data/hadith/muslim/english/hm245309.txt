24|5309|  Chapter: It Is forbidden to add false hair to one’s head or to pluck the eyebrow or to  separate the teeth.         Sa,id b. Musayyib reported that Mu’awiya said one day: Should I narrate to you the evil  make-up. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) forbade cheating. It was during that  time that a person came with a staff and there was a cloth on its head, whereupon  Mu,awiya said: Behold, that is cheating. Qatada said: This implies how women  artificially increase their hair with the help of rags.

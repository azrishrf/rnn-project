30|5731|  Chapter: It is very seldom that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said ‘No” to anyone  when asked to give anything, and he gave charity to the people very freely.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: In  case we get wealth from Bahrain, I would give you so much and so much; he made an  indication of it with both his hands. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) died before  wealth from Bahrain came, and it fell to the lot of Abu Bakr after him. He commanded  the announcer to make announcement to the effect that he to whom Allah’s Apostle  (may peace be upon him) had held out promise or owed any debt should come (to him).  I came and said: Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had said to me: In case there  comes to us the wealth of Bahrain I shall give you so much, and so much. Abu Bakr  took a handful (of the coins) and gave that to me once and asked me to count them I  counted them as five hundred dinars and he said: Here is double of this for you.

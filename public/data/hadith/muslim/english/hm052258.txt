5|2258|  Chapter: Miskin (poor man) is one who does not find enough to satisfy him and the people do  not consider him(needy) as to give him charity.  Mu’awiya reported Allah’s Messenger (may prom be upon him) as saying: Do not beg  importunately, for, I swear by Allah, none of you who asks me for anything and  manages to get what he asks for when I disapprove td it will he be blessed in that which  I give him.

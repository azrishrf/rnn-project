3|613|  Chapter: Bathing is obligatory for a woman after experiencing orgasm in dream.  It is reported on the authority of ‘Aisha that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) and inquired: Should a woman wash herself when she sees a  sexual dream and sees (the marks) of liquid? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. ‘Aisha  said to her: May your hand be covered with dust and injured. She narrated: The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Leave her alone. In what way does  the child resemble her but for the fact that when the genes contributed by woman  prevail upon those of man, the child resembles the maternal family, and when the genes  of man prevail upon those of woman the child resembles the paternal family.

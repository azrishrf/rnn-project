31|5932|  Chapter: Merits of Sa’d b. Abi Waqqis (Allah be pleased with him).  ‘Amir b. Sa’d reported on the authority of his father that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) gathered for him on the Day of Uhud his parents when a polytheist had set  fire to (i.e. attacked fiercely) the Muslims. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) said to him: (Sa’d), shoot an arrow, (Sa’d), may my mother and father be  taken as ransom for you. I drew an arrow and I shot a featherless arrow at him aiming         his side that lie fell down and his private parts were exposed. Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) laughed that I saw his front teeth.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

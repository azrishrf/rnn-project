5|2181|  Chapter: Beginning of spending for one’s own self, then for one’s family and then for relatives.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Of the  dinar you spend as a contribution in Allah’s path, or to set free a slave, or as a sadaqa         given to a needy, or to support your family, the one yielding the greatest reward is that  which you spent on your family.

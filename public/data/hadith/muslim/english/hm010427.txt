1|427|  Chapter: This Ummah (Ummah of Islam) would constitute half of the inhabitants of  Paradise.  Abdullah b. Mas’ud reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  addressing us said: Aren’t you pleased that you should constitute one-fourth of the  inhabitants of Paradise? He (the narrator) said: We glorified (our Lord, i.e. we called  aloud Allah-o Akbar, Allah is the Greatest). He, then, again said: Aren’t you pleased that  you should constitute one-third of the inhabitants of Paradise? He (the narrator) said:  We glorified (our Lord) and he (the Holy Prophet) then again said: I hope that you would  constitute half of the inhabitants of Paradise and I shall explain to you its (reason). The  believers among the unbelievers would not be more than a white hair on (the body of a)  black ox or a black hair on (the body of a) white ox.

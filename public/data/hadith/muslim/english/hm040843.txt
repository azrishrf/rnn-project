4|843|  Chapter: The Muqtadi (follower) should strictly follow the Imam in prayer.  Anas reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not come to us for  three days. When the prayer was about to start. Abu Bakr stepped forward (to lead the  prayer), and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) lifted the curtain. When the  face of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) became visible to us, we (found)         that no sight was more endearing to us than the face of the Apostle of Allah (may peace  be upon him) as it appeared to us. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) with  the gesture of his hand directed Abu Bakr to step forward (and lead the prayer). The  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) then drew the curtain, and we could not see  him till he died.

4|1106|  Chapter: Forbiddance of talking in prayer and abrogation of what was permissible.  Abu Darda’ reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up (to pray)  and we heard him say: “I seek refuge in Allah from thee.” Then said: ” curse thee with  Allah’s curse” three times, then he stretched out his hand as though he was taking hold  of something. When he finished the prayer, we said: Messenger of Allah, we heard you  say something during the prayer which we have not heard you say before, and we saw  you stretch out your hand. He replied: Allah’s enemy Iblis came with a flame of fire to  put it in my face, so I said three times: “I Seek refuge in Allah from thee.” Then I said  three times: “I curse thee with Allah’s full curse.” But he did not retreat (on any one of  these) three occasions. Thereafter I meant to seize him. I swear by Allah that had it not  been for the supplication of my brother Sulaiman he would have been bound, and made  an object of sport for the children of Medina.

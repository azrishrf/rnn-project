19|4351|  Chapter: The saying of the Prophet (may peace be upon him): “We (Prophets) do not  have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity”.  It is narrated on the authority of ‘Aisha who said: When the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) passed away, his wives made up their minds to send ‘Uthman b.  ‘Affan (as their spokesman) to Abu Bakr to demand from him their share from the legacy  of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). (At this), ‘Aisha said to them: Hasn’t the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: “We (Prophets) do not have any  heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity”?

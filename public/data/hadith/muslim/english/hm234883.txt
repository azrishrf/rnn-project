23|4883|  Chapter: Forbiddance of wine.  â€˜Abd al-Aziz b. Suhaib reported: They (some persons) asked Anas b. Malik, about  Fadikh (that is, a wine prepared from fresh dates), whereupon he said: There was no  liquor with us except this Fadikih of yours. It was only this Fadikh that I had been  serving to Abu Talha and Abu Ayyub and some persons from amongst the Companions  of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in our house. When a person came  and said: Has the news reached you? We said, No. He said: Verily liquor has been  declared forbidden. Thereupon, Abd Talha said: Anas, spill these large pitchers. He (the  narrator) said: They then never reverted to it, nor even asked about this after the  announcement by that person.

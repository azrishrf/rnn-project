30|5684|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  Abdullah b. ‘Amr al-‘As, reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: My  Cistern (is as wide and broad that it requires) a month’s journey (to go round it) all, and its sides  are equal and its water is whiter than silver, and its odour is more fragrant than the fragrance of  musk, and its jugs (placed round it) are like stars in the sky; and he who would drink from it would  never feel thirsty after that. Asma’, daughter of Abu Bakr said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon  him)  said:  I  would  be on  the  Cistern  and  so  that  I  would  be  seeing  those  who  would  be  coming to me from you, but some people would be detained (before reaching me). I would say:  My Lord, they are my followers and belong to my Umma, and it would be said to me: Do you know  what they did after you? By Allah, they did not do good after you, and they turned back upon their         heels. He (the narrator) said: Ibn Abu Mulaika used to say (in supplication): O Allah, I seek refuge  with Thee that we should turn back upon our heels or put to any trial about our religion.

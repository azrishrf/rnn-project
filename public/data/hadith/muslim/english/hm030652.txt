3|652|  Chapter: The woman who has a prolonged flow of blood, her bathing and prayer.  â€˜Aisha reported: Fatimah b. Abu Hubaish came to the Apostle (may peace be upon him)  and said: I am a woman whose blood keeps flowing (even after the menstruation  period). I am never purified; should I, therefore, abandon prayer? He (the Holy Prophet)  said: Not at all, for that is only a vein, and is not a menstruation, so when menstruation  comes, abandon prayer, and when it ends wash the blood from yourself and then pray.

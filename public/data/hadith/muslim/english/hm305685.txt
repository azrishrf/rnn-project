30|5685|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  ‘Aisha reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say in the company of his  Companions:  I  would  be  on  the  Cistern  waiting  for  those  who  would  be  coming to  me  from  amongst you. By Allah, some persons would be prevented from coming to me, and I would say:  My Lord, they are my followers and people of my Umma. And He would say,: You don’t know  what they did after you; they had been constantly turning back on their heels (from their religion).  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

31|5999|  Chapter: The merits of Fatima, daughter of Allah’s apostle (may peace be upon him).  Miswar b. Makhramali reported that he heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) say, as he sat on the pulpit: The sons of Hisham b. Mughira have asked my  permission to marry their daughter with ‘Ali b. Abi Talib (that refers to the daughter of  Abu Jahl for whom ‘All had sent a proposal for marriage). But I would not allow them, I  would not allow them, I would not allow them (and the only alternative possible is) that  ‘Ali should divorce my daughter (and then marry their daughter), for my daughter is part  of me. He who disturbs her in fact disturbs me and he who offends her offends me.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

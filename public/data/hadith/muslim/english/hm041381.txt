4|1381|  Chapter: Forbiddance to go out of the mosque after the Adhan has been announced by the  Mu’adhdhin.  Jundab b. ‘Abdullah reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  He who prayed the morning prayer (in congregation) he is in fact under the protection of  Allah. And it can never happen that Allah should demand anything from you in         connection with the protection (that He guarantees) and one should not get it. He would  then throw him in the fire of Hell.

8|3466|  Chapter: Advice in regards to woman.  AbuHuraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) as saying: Woman is like a rib. When you attempt to straighten it, you would  break it. And if you leave her alone you would benefit by her, and crookedness will  remain in her. A hadith like this is reported by another chain of narrators.

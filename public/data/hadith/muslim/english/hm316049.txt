31|6049|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Dharr (Allah be pleased with him).  Ibn ‘Abbas reported that when Abu Dharr heard of the advent of the Apostle (may peace  be upon him) in Mecca he said: Brother, ride in this valley and bring information for me  about the person who claims that there comes to him information from the Heavens.  Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he  heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu  Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his         expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I have not been  satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up  provisions for the journey and a small water-skin containing water (and set forth) until he  came to Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka’ba) and began to find out Allah’s Apostle  (may peace be upon him) and he did not recognise him (the Holy Prophet) and he did  not even like that he should ask about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept.  ‘Ali saw him and found him to be a stranger. So he went with him. He followed hive but  one did not make any inquiry from the other about anything until it was morning. He  then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he  did not see Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) until it was night. He then returned  to his bed that there happened to pass ‘Ali and he said: This man has not been able to  find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one  made an inquiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he  did the same. ‘Ali made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him,  besides Whom there is no god, why don’t you tell me (the reason) which brought you  here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a  covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He (‘Ali) said: Verily, he Is  truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and when it is  morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you  I would stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow  me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him). He entered (the house) of Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) along with him and listened to his words and embraced Islam at his  very place. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Go to your people and  inform them until my command reaches you. Thereupon he said: By Him in Whose  Hand is my life, I shall say to the people of Mecca this thing at the top of my voice So he  set forth until he came to the mosque and then spoke at the top of his voice (saying):I  bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the  Messenger of Allah. The people attacked him and made him fall down when ‘Abbas  came and he leaned over him and said: Woe be upon you, don’t you know that he is  from amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trading route to Syria passes through (the  settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him. He (Abu Dharr) did the same on the next  day and they (the Meccans) again attacked him and Abbas leaned upon him and he  rescued him.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

23|4892|  Chapter: It is forbidden to use wine as a medicine.  Wa’il al-Hadrami reported that Tariq b. Suwaid a-Ju’fi asked Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him) about liquor. He forbade (its use) and he expressed hatred that it should  be prepared. He (Tariq) said: I prepare it as a medicine, whereupon he (the Holy  Prophet) said: It is no medicine, but an ailment.

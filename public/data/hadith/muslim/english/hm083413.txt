8|3413|  Chapter: It is forbidden to marry the step daughter and the sister of the wife (when the wife is  alive and not divorced).  Umm Habiba, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him), reported that she  said to Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him): Messenger of Allah, marry my  sister ‘Azza, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) said: Do you like  it? She said: Yes, Messenger of Allah, I am not the exclusive wife of yours, and I wish  that the person who joins me in good should be my sister. Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (May peace be upon him) said: That is not lawful for me. I said: Messenger  of Allah, we discussed that You intend to marry Durrah bint Abu Salama. He (the Holy  Prophet) said: You mean the daughter of Abu Salama? She said: Yes, whereupon  Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) said: Even if she were not the step- daughter of mine, brought up under my guardianship, she would not have been lawful         for me, for she is the daughter of my foster-brother. Thuwaiba gave me suck and to Abu  Salama (also), so do not offer to me your daughters and sisters.

7|3091|  Chapter: The validity of the Hajj performed by a boy and reward for one who enables  him to perform it (by accompanying him and bearing expenses for him).  Ibn Abbas reported that Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) met some riders at al- Rauha and asked who they were. They replied that they were Muslims. They said: Who  art thou? He said: (I am) Messenger of Allah. A woman (then) lifted up a boy to him and  said: Would this child be credited with having performed the Hajj? Thereupon he said:  Yes, and you will have a reward.

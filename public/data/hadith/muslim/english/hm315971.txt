31|5971|  Chapter: The merits of Hadrat Khadija, mother of the faithful (Allah be pleased with her).  â€˜Aisha reported: Never did I feel jealous of any woman as I was jealous of Khadija. She  had died three years before he (the Holy Prophet) married me. I often heard him praise  her, and his lord, the Exalted and Glorious, had commanded him to give her the glad  tidings of a palace of jewels in Paradise: and whenever he slaughtered a sheep he  presented (its meat) to her female companions.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

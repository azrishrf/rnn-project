22|4878|  Chapter: It is forbidden to sacrifice the animal for anyone besides Allah, the Exalted,  and curse upon one who does it.  Abu Tufail reported: ‘Ali was asked whether Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) had showed special favour (by disclosing to him) a thing (which he kept secret  from others). Thereupon he said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) singled  us not for (disclosing to us) anything (secret) which he did not make public, (but those  few things) which lie in the sheath of my sword. He drew out the written document  contained in it and on that (it was mentioned): Allah cursed him who sacrificed for  anyone else besides Allah ; and Allah cursed him who stole the signposts (demarcating  the boundary lines of the) land; and Allah cursed him who cursed his father; and Allah  cursed him who accommodated an innovator (in religion).

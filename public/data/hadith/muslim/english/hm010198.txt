1|198|  Chapter: Serious prohibition of letting down the lower garment: of laying obligation of  selling goods by false oaths, and description of those three (persons) with whom Allah  would not speak on the Day of Resurrection nor would He see towards them nor would  absolve them, and for them is a painful chastisement.  This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that he (the Apostle of  Allah)observed: Three are the persons with whom Allah would neither speak (on the  Day of Resurrection) nor would He look at them, and there would be a painful  chastisement for them, a person who took an oath on the goods of a Muslim in the  afternoon and then broke it. The rest of the hadith is the same as narrated by Aâ€™mash.

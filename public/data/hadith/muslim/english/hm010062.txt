1|62|  Chapter: Concerning the comprehensive attributes of Islam.  It is narrated on the authority of Sufyan b. â€˜Abdulla al-Thaqafi that he said: I asked the  Messenger of Allah to tell me about Islam a thing which might dispense with the  necessity of my asking anybody after you. In the hadith of Abu Usama the (words) are:  other than you. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: Say I affirm my faith in Allah and then  remain steadfast to it.

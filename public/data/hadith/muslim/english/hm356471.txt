35|6471|  Chapter: Exhortation for the remembrance of Allah, the Exalted.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that Allah,  the Exalted and Glorious, thus stated: I am near to the thought of My servant as he  thinks about Me, and I am with him as he remembers Me. And if he remembers Me in  his heart, I also remember him in My Heart, and if he remembers Me in assembly I  remember him in assembly, better than his (remembrance), and if he draws near Me by  the span of a palm, I draw near him by the cubit, and if he draws near Me by the cubit I  draw near him by the space (covered by) two hands. And if he walks towards Me, I rush  towards him.  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

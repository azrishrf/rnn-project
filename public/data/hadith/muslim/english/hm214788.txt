21|4788|  Chapter: Pertaining to the flesh of the Lizard.  Ibn ‘Umar reported that there were some persons with Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) from among his Companions, Sa’d being one of them. There was brought to  them the flesh of the lizard when a lady amongst the wives of Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) said: It is the flesh of the lizard. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (way  peace be upon him) &aid: Eat, for it is lawful, but it is not my diet.

30|5661|  Chapter: The miracles of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  Jabir reported that a person came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and asked for food.  And  he  gave  him  half  a  wasq  of  barley,  and  the  person  and  his  wife  and  their  guests  kept  on  making use of it (as a food) until he weighed it (in order to find out the actual quantity, and it was  no more). He came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) (and informed him about it). He  said: Had you not weighed it, you would be eating out of it and it would have remained intact for  you.

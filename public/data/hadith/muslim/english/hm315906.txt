31|5906|  Chapter: Merits of ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan (Allah be pleased with him).         ‘Aisha reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was lying in the bed in my  apartment with his thigh or his shank uncovered that Abu Bakr sought permission to get  in. It was given to him and he conversed in the same very state (the Prophet’s thigh or  shank uncovered). Then ‘Umar sought permission for getting in and it was given to him  and he conversed in that very state. Then ‘Uthman sought permission for getting in;  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sat down and he set right his clothes.  Muhammad (one of the narrators) said: I do not say that it happened on the same day.  He (‘Uthman) then entered and conversed and as he went out, ‘Aisha said: Abu Bakr  entered and you did not stir and did not observe much care (in arranging your clothes),  then ‘Umar entered and you did not stir and did not arrange your clothes, then ‘Uthman  entered and you got up and set your clothes right, thereupon he said: Should I not show  modesty to one whom even the Angels show modesty.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

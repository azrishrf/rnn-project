1|423|  Chapter: The admittance into Paradise of a group of Muslims without rendering any  account and suffering punishment (torment).  â€˜Imran b. Husain reported: Verily the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  Seventy thousand men of my Ummah would enter Paradise without rendering account.  They (the companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Who would be those, Messenger of  Allah? He (the Holy Prophet) said: They would be those who neither practise charm, not  take omens, nor do they cauterise, but they repose their trust in their Lord.

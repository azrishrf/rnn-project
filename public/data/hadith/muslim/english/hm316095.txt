31|6095|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Sufyan b. Harb (Allah be pleased with him).  Ibn Abbas reported that the Muslims neither looked to Abu Sufyan (with respect) nor did  they sit in his company; he (Abu Sufyan) said to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him): Allah’s Apostle, confer upon me three things. He replied in the affirmative. He  (further) said: I have with me the most handsome and the best (woman) Umm Habiba,  daughter of Abu Sufyan; marry her, whereupon he said: Yes. And he again said: Accept  Mu’awiya to serve as your scribe. He said: Yes. He again said: Make me the  commander (of the Muslim army) so that I should fight against the unbelievers as I  fought against the Muslims. He said: Yes. Abu Zumnail said: If he had not asked for  these three things from Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), he would have never  conferred them upon him, for it was (his habit) to accede to everybody’s (earnest)  request.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

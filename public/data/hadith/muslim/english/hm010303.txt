1|303|  Chapter: The beginning of Revelation to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him).  This hadith has been reported from ‘Aisha by another chain of transmitters and the  words are: He (the Holy Prophet) came to Khadija an his heart was trembling. The rest  of the hadith has been narrated like one transmitted by Yunus and Ma’mar, but the first  part is not mentioned, i.e. the first thing with which was started the revelation to the Holy  Prophet was the true vision. And these words like those transmitted by Yunus are         mentioned thus: By Allah, Allah would never humiliate you. And there is also a mention  of the words of Khadija: O son of my uncle! Listen to the son of your brother.

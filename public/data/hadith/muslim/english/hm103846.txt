10|3846|  Chapter: Sale of wheat like for like.  Nafi’ reported that Ibn ‘Umar told him that a person of the tribe of Laith said that Abu  Sa’id al-Kludri narrated it (the above-mentioned hadith) from tile Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) in a narration of Qutaiba. So ‘Abduliali and Nafi’ went along  with him, and in the hadith transmitted by Ibn Rumh (the words are) that Nafi’ said:  ‘Abdullah (b. ‘Umar) went and I along with the person belonging to Banu Laith entered  (the house) of Sa’id al-Khudri, and he (‘Abdullah b. Umar) said: I have been informed  that you say that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade the sale of silver  with silver except in case of like for like, and sale of gold for gold except in case of like  for like. Abu Sa’id pointed towards this eyes and his ears with his fingers and said: My         eyes saw, and my ears listened to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saying:  Do not sell gold for gold, and do not sell silver for silver except in case of like for like,  and do not increase something of it upon something, and do not sell for ready money  something, not present, but hand to hand.

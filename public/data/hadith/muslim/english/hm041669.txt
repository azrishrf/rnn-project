4|1669|  Chapter: Exhortation to supplicate and make mention (of Allah) at the end of the night and its  acceptance by the Lord.  Ubayy b Ka’b reported: By Allah, I know about Lailat-ul Qadr and I know it fully well that  it is the twenty-seventh night (during Ramadan) on which the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) commanded us to observe prayer. (Shu’ba was in doubt about  these words: “the night on which the Messenger of Allah [may peace be upon him]  commanded us to observe the prayer.” This has been transmitted to me by a friend of  mine.)

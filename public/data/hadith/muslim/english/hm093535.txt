9|3535|  Chapter: One who is divorced by three pronouncements of whose husband has died  can get out of her house for a need during her period of ‘Idda.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: My maternal aunt was  divorced, and she intended to pluck her dates. A person scolded her for having come  out (during the period of ‘Idda). She came to Allah’s Prophet (may peace be upon him.)  and he said: Certainly you can pluck (dates) from your palm trees, for perhaps you may  give charity or do an act of kindness.

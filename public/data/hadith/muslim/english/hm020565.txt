2|565|  Chapter: Pertaining to the urine of the suckling babe, and how it is to be washed away.  Ubaidullah b. Abdullah b. ‘Utba b. Mas’ud said: Umm Qais, daughter of Mihsan, was  among the earliest female emigrants who took the oath of allegiance to the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him), and she was the sister of ‘Ukkasha b. Mihsan, one  amongst the sons of Asad b. Khuzaima. He (the narrator) said: She (Umm Qais) told  me that she came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) with her son and  he had not attained the age of eating food. He (the narrator, ‘Ubaidullah), said: She told  me that her son passed urine in the lap of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent for water and sprayed it  over his garment (over that part which was contaminated with the urine of the child) and  he did not wash it thoroughly.

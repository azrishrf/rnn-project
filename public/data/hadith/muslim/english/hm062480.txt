6|2480|  Chapter: Permissibility of observing the fast or not observing it in the month of Ramadan for a  traveller.         Abu Saâ€™id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We went out on an expedition  with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) during Ramadan. Some of us  observed the fast and some of us broke it. Neither the observer of the fast had any  grudge against one who broke it, nor the breaker of the fast had any grudge against one  who had fasted They knew that he who had strength enough (to bear its rigour) fasted  and that was good, and they also found that he who felt weakness (and could not bear  the burden) broke it, and that was also good.

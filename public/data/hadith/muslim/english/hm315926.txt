31|5926|  Chapter: Merits of Sa’d b. Abi Waqqis (Allah be pleased with him).  ‘Aisha reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon him) laid down on bed  during one night on his arrival at Medina and said: Were there a pious person from  amongst my Companions who should keep a watch for me during the night? She  (‘Aisha) reported: We were in this state that we heard the clanging noise of arms lie (the  Holy Prophet) said: Who is it? He said: This is Sa’d b. Abi Waqqas. Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) said to him: What brings you here? Thereupon he said: I  harboured fear (lest any harm should come to) Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him), so I came to serve as your sentinel. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  invoked blessings upon him. He then slept. This hadith has been transmitted on the  authority of Ibn Rumh with a slight variation of wording.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

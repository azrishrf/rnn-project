7|2753|  Chapter: What is to be done with a Muhrim when he dies.  Sa’id b. Jubair heard Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) as saying: A person came  to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) while he was in the state of ihram. He fell  down from his camel and broke his neck. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) commanded to bathe him with water (mixed with the leaves of) the lote (tree),  and shroud him in two (pieces of) cloth and not to apply perfume (to him), keeping his  head out (of the shroud). Shu’ba said: He then narrated to me after this (the words)  “keeping his head out,” his face out, for he would be raised on the Day of Resurrection  pronouncing Talbiya.

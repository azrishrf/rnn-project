31|5977|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her).  ‘Aisha reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said: I saw you in a  dream for three nights when an angel brought you to me in a silk cloth and he said:  Here is your wife, and when I removed (the cloth) from your face, lo, it was yourself, so I  said: If this is from Allah, let Him carry it out.           HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

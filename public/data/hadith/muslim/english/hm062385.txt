6|2385|  Chapter: The month may consist of twenty-nine days.  Jabir (Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon  him) separated himself from his wives for a month.

Thereupon  he said: So far as the month is concerned, (and he, with a view to explaining it) flapped  his hands thrice, but held back one finger at the last turn.

5|2255|  Chapter: It is forbidden to beg.  Hakim b. Hizam reported: I begged the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), and  he gave me. I again begged, he again gave me. I again begged, he again gave me, and  then said: This property is green and sweet; he who receives it with a cheerful heart is  blessed in it, and he who receives it with an avaricious mind would not be blessed in it,  he being like one who eats without being satisfied, and the upper hand is better than the  lower hand.

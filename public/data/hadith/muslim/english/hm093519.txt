Sha’bi reported: I visited Fatima bint Qais and asked her about the verdict of Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) about (board and lodging during the ‘Idda) and  she said that her husband divorced her with an irrevocable divorce. She (further said): I  contended with him before Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about lodging  and maintenance allowance, and she said: He did not provide me with any lodging or  maintenance allowance, and he commanded me to spend the ‘Idda in the house of Ibn  Umm Maktum.

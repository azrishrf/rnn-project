17|4199|  Chapter: He who confesses his guilt of adultery.  Jabir b. Samura reported that there was brought to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) a short-statured person with thick uncombed hair, muscular body, having a  mantle around him and he had committed adultery. He turned him away twice and then  made pronouncement about him and he was stoned. Then Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: We set out for Jihad in the cause of Allah and one of you  lagged behind and shrieked like the bleating of a male goat and one of then (goats’  gave a small quantity of milk. In case Allah gives me power over one of them, I will  punish him (in such a way that it may have a deterrent effect upon others). In another  narration transmitted on the authority of Sa’id b Jubair (the words are), that He (the Holy  Prophet) turned him away four times.”

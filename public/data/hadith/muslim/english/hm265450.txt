26|5450|  Chapter: The excellence of curing (with the help of incantation) the influence of the evil eye and  small pustules and the poison (especially of snake and scorpion).  Umm Salama, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), reported that  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to a small girl in the house of Umm  Salama that he had been seeing on her face black stains and told her that that was due  to the influence of an evil eye, and he asked that she should be cured with the help of  incantation (hoping) that her face should become spotless.

1|133|  Chapter: The unbelief of one who said: We got rainfall by the movement (of the stars).  It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  and blessings be upon him) said: Donâ€™t you know what your Lord said? He observed: I  have never endowed My bondsmen with a favour, but a section amongst them  disbelieved it and said: Stars, it was due to the stars.

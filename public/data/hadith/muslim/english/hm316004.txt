31|6004|  Chapter: The merits of Fatima, daughter of Allah’s apostle (may peace be upon him).  ‘Aisha reported: We, the wives of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), were with  him (during his last illness) and none was absent there-from that Fatima, who walked  after the style of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), came there, and when  he saw her he welcomed her saying: You are welcome, my daughter. He their made her  sit on his right side or on his left side. Then he said something secretly to her and she  wept bitterly and when he found her (plunged) in grief he said to her something secretly  for the second time and she laughed. I (‘Aisha) said to her: Allah’s Messenger has  singled you amongst the women (of the family) for talking (to you something secretly)  and you wept. When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) recovered from  illness, I said to her. What did Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say to you?  Thereupon she said: I am not going to disclose the secret of Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him). When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) died, I said to  her: I adjure you by the right that I have upon you that you should narrate to me what  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to you. She said: Yes, now I can do  that (so listen to it). When he talked to me secretly for the first time he informed me that  Gabirel was in the habit of reciting the Qur’an along with him once or twice every year,  but this year it had been twice and so he perceived his death quite near, so fear Allah  and be patient (and he told me) that he would be a befitting forerunner for me and so I  wept as you saw me. And when he saw me in grief he talked to me secretly for the  second time and said: Fatima, are you not pleased that you should be at the head of the  believing women or the head of this Umma? I laughed and it was that laughter which  you saw.           HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

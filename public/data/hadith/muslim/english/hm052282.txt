5|2282|  Chapter: one is not rich because of the abundance of goods.  Anas reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If the son of  Adam were to possess two valleys of riches, he would long for the third one. And the  stomach of the son of Adam is not filled but with dust. And Allah returns to him who  repents.

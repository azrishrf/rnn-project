Munabbih said: These are some of the a Hadith of Muhammad. the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), transmitted to us on the authority of Abu  Huraira. So he narrated one Hadith out of them (as this): The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: No woman should observe fast when her spouse is present  (in the house) but with his permission. And she should not admit any (mahram) in his         house, while he (her husband) is present, but with his permission. And whatever she  spends from his earnings without his sanction, for him is half the reward.

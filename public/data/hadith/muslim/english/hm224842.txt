22|4842|  Chapter: It is meritorious to sacrifice the animal with one’s own hand and so is  meritorious the recitation of Bismillah (in the name of Allah) and Takbir (Allah o-Akbar).  Anas reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sacrificed two horned  rams of white colour with black markings over them. He also stated: I saw him  sacrificing them with his own hand and saw him placing his foot on their sides, and  recited the name of Allah and Glorified Him.

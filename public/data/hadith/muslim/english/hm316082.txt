31|6082|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Huraira Al-Dawsi Al-Yamani (Allah be pleased with him).  Abu Huraira reported: I invited my mother, who was a polytheist, to Islam. I invited her  one day and she said to me something about Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) which I hated. I came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) weeping and  said: Allah’s Messenger, I invited my mother to Islam but she did not accept (my  invitation). I invited her today but she said to me something which I did not like. (Kindly)  supplicate Allah that He may set the mother of Abu Huraira right. Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, set the mother of Abu Huraira on  the right path. I came out quite pleased with the supplication of Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) and when I came near the door it was closed from within. My  mother heard the noise of my footsteps and she said: Abu Huraira, just wait, and I heard  the noise of falling of water. She took a bath and put on the shirt and quickly covered  her head with a headdress and opened the door and then said: Abu Huraira, I bear  witness to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His bondsman and  His Messenger. He (Abu Huraira) said: I went back to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) and (this time) I was shedding the tears of joy. I said: Allah’s Messenger, be  happy, for Allah has responded to your supplication and He has set on the right path the  mother of Abu Huraira. He (the Holy Prophet) praised Allah, and extolled Him and  uttered good words. I said: Allah’s Messenger, supplicate to Allah so that He may instil  love of mine and that of my mother too in the believing servants and let our hearts be  filled with their love, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O  Allah, let there be love of these servants of yours, i.e. Abu Huraira and his mother, in  the hearts of the believing servants and let their hearts be filled with the love of the  believing servants. (Abu Huraira said: This prayer) was so well granted by Allah that no  believer was ever born who heard of me and who saw me but did not love me.         HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

22|4848|  Chapter: Permissibility of slaughtering the animal with anything which may make its  blood flow except tooth, nail and bone.  Rafi’ b. Khadij reported from his grandfather that he said: Allah’s Messenger, we are  going to encounter the enemy tomorrow, but we do not have long knives with us, should  we then slaughter them with the peel of the reed? The rest of the hadith is the same.  (And at the end the words are): “A camel became wild (and got out of our control). We  attacked it with arrows until we made it fall down.” This hadith has been narrated on the  authority of Sa’id b. Masruq with the same chain of transmitters with a slight variation of  words.

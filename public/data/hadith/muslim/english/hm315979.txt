31|5979|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her).  ‘Aisha reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: I can well  discern when you are pleased with me and when you are annoyed with me. I said: How  do you discern it? Thereupon be said: When you are pleased with me you say; “No, by  the Lord of Muhammad,” and when you are annoyed with me, you say: “No, by the Lord  of Ibrahim.” I said: Allah’s Messenger, by Allah, I in fact leave your name (when I am  annoyed with you).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

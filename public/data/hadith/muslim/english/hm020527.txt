2|527|  Chapter: Wiping over the socks.  Mughira b. Shu’ba reported: I was in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) on a journey when he said: Mughira take hold of this jar (of water). I  took hold of it and I went out with him. (I stopped but) the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) proceeded on till he was out of my sight. He relieved himself and  then came back and he was wearing a tight-sleeved Syrian gown. He tried to get his  forearms out, but the sleeve of the gown was very narrow, so he brought his hands out  from under the gown. I poured water over (his hands) and he performed ablution for  prayer, then wiped over his socks and prayed.

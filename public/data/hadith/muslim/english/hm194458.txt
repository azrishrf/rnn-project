19|4458|  Chapter: Women participants in jihid to be given a prize but not a regular share in the booty,  and prohibition to kill children of the enemy.  It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Hurmuz who said: Najda b. ‘Amir al- Haruri wrote to Ibn Abbas asking him about the slave and the woman as to whether  they would get a share from the booty (it they participated in Jihad); about the killing of  (enemy) children (in war); about the orphan as to when his orphan-hood comes to an  end; about kinsmen (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. He said to Yazid: Write to  him. (If he were not likely to fall into folly, I would not have written to him.) Write: You  have written asking about the woman and the slave whether they would get a share of  the booty if they participated in Jihad. (You should know that) there is nothing of the sort  for them except that they will be given a prize. And you have written asking me about  the killing of the enemy children in war. (You should understand that) the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) did not kill them and thou shouldst not kill them unless  thou knew what the companion of Moses (i.e. Khadir) knew about the boy he had killed.  And you have written asking me about the orphan as to when the period of his orphan- hood comes to an end, so that the sobriquet of “orphan” is dropped from him. (In this  regard, you should know that) the sobriquet “orphan” will not be dropped from him until  he attains maturity of body and mind. And you have written asking me about the close  relatives (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. We think that it is we, but our people  have denied us this (position and its concomitant privileges).

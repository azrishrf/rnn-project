30|5728|  Chapter: It is very seldom that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said ‘No” to anyone  when asked to give anything, and he gave charity to the people very freely.  Musa b. Anas reported on the authority of his father: It never happened that Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) was asked anything for the sake of Islam and he  did not give that. There came to him a person and he gave him a large flock (of sheep  and goats) and he went back to his people and said: My people, embrace Islam, for  Muhammad gives so much charity as if he has no fear of want.

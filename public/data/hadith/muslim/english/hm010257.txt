1|257|  Chapter: Warning for one appropriating the right of a Muslim by taking a false oath: the  fire (of Hell) is his chastisement.  It is narrated on the authority of Waâ€™il that there came a person from Hadramaut and  another one from Kinda to the Apostle (may peace be upon him). One who had come  from Hadramaut said: Messenger of Allah, only this man has appropriated my land  which belonged to my father. The one who had came from Kinda contended. This is my  land and is in my possession: I cultivate it. There is no right for him in it. The Messenger  of Allah said to the Hadramite: Have you any evidence (to support you)? He replied in  the negative. He (the Apostle of Allah) said: Then your case is to be decided on his  oath. He (the Hadramite) said: Messenger of Allah, he is a liar and cares not what he  swears and has no regard for anything. Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah)  remarked: For you then there is no other help to it. He (the man from Kinda) set out to  take an oath. When he turned his back the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) observed: If he took an oath on his property with a view to usurping it, he would  certainly meet his Lord in a state that He would turn away from him.

9|3567|  Chapter: Li’an (Invoking curse).  Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported: Mention was made of li’an in the  presence of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). And Asim b. ‘Adi passed a  remark about it and then turned away, and a man of his tribe came to him complaining  that he had found a man with his wife, whereupon ‘Asim said: I have been taken by my  words. He took him to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and told him about  the man whom he had found with his wife and this man was a lean, yellow-coloured  man with lank hair, and the person who was accused of committing adultery with her  (his wife) had fleshy shanks, with wheat complexion and heavy bulk. Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, make (this case) manifest. And as she gave  birth to a child, whose face resembled that person about whom her husband had made  mention that he had found her with, and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be, upon him)  had asked them to invoke curses. A person said to Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with  him): Is she (that woman) about whom Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  (said): “If I were to stone anybody without evidence, I would have stoned her”? Ibn  ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) said: No, it is not she. That woman was one who         openly spread evil in society. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn  ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) through another chain of transmitters with the  addition of these words: ‘With flesh, and curly tangled hair.”

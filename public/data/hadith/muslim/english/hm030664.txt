3|664|  Chapter: One should draw around a curtain while taking a bath.  Umm Hani b. Abu Talib reported: It was the day of the conquest (of Mecca) that she  went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he was staying at a  higher part (of that city). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) got up for  his bath. Fatimah held a curtain around him (in order to provide him privacy). He then  put on his garments and wrapped himself with that and then offered eight rakâ€™ahs of the  forenoon prayer.

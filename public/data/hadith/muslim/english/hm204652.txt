20|4652|  Chapter: Merit of Jihad and of keeping vigilance (over the enemy).  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Saâ€™id Khudri that a man came to the Holy  Prophet (may peace he upon him) and said: Who is the best of men? He replied: A man  who fights in the way of Allah spending his wealth and staking his life. The man then  asked: Who is next to him (in excellence)? He said: Next to him is a believer who lives  in a mountain gorge worshipping hid Lord and sparing men from his mischief.

1|205|  Chapter: Suicide is the gravest sin.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira: We participated in the Battle of Hunain  along with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He (the Holy Prophet) said  about a man who claimed to be a Muslim that he was one of the denizens of the Fire (of  Hell). When we were in the thick of the battle that man fought desperately and was  wounded. It was said: Messenger of Allah, the person whom you at first called as the  denizen of Fire fought desperately and died. Upon this the Apostle of Allah (may peace  be upon him) remarked: He was doomed to the Fire (of Hell). Some men were on the  verge of doubt (about his fate) when it was said that he was not dead but fatally  wounded. When it was night he could not stand the (pain of his) wound and killed  himself. The Apostle (may peace be upon him) was informed of that. He (the Holy  Prophet) observed: Allah is Great, I bear testimony to the fact that I am the servant of  Allah and His messenger. He then commanded Bilal to announce to the people that  none but a Muslim would enter Paradise. Verily Allah helps this faith even by a sinful  person.

20|4667|  Chapter: The merit of helping the warrior (fighting in the way of Allah) with something to  ride upon and looking after his family in his absence.  It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that a young man from Aslam  tribe said: Messenger of Allah, I wish to fight (in the way of Allah) but I donâ€™t have  anything to equip myself with for fighting. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Go to so and so,  for he had equipped himself (for fighting) but he fell ill. So, he (the young man) went to  him and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sends you his  greetings and says that you should give me the equipage that you have provided  yourself with. The man said (to his wife or maidservant): So and so, give him the  equipage I have collected for myself and do not withhold anything from him. Do not  withhold anything from him so that you may be blessed therein.

31|6160|  Chapter: Meaning of the saying of the Prophet (may peace be upon him): “No person would  survive after a century who is living by this time of mine”.  ‘Abdullah b. Umar reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) led us  ‘Isha prayer at the latter part of the night and when he had concluded it by salutations  he stood up and said: Have you seen this night of yours? At the end of one hundred  years after this none would survive on the surface of the earth (from amount my  Companions). Ibn Umar said: People were (not understanding) these words of the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) which had been uttered pertaining to one  hundred years. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in fact meant (by these  words) that on that day none from amongst those who had been living upon the earth  (from amongst his Companions) would survive (after one hundred years) and that would  be the end of this generation.         HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

35|6492|  Chapter: He who loves to meet Allah, Allah also loves to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet  Allah. Allah also abhors to meet him.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who  loves meeting Allah, Allah loves to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet Allah, Allah  abhors to meet him. I (Shuraih b. Hani, one of the narrators) came to ‘Aisha and said to  her: Mother of the faithful, I heard Abu Huraira narrate from Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) which, if it is actually so, is a destruction to us. Thereupon she said:  Those are in fact ruined who are ruined at the words of Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him). What are (the words which in your opinion would cause your  destruction)? He said that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had stated: He  who loves to meet Allah, Allah too loves to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet Allah,  Allah too abhors to meet him, and there is none amongst us who dons not hate death.  Thereupon she said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has in fact stated  this, but it does not mean what you construe, but it implies (the time) when one loses  the lustre of the eye, and there is rattling in the throat, shudder in the body and  convulsion in fingers (at the time of death). (It is about this time) that it has been said:         He who loves to meet Allah, Allah would love to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet  Allah, Allah would abhor to meet him  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

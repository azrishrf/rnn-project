4|1828|  Chapter: Excellence of observing two Rak’ahs before the evening prayer.  Sahl b. Abu Hathma reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led  his Companions in prayer in danger. He made them stand in two rows behind him. He  led them who were close to him in one rak’ah. He then stood up and kept standing till  those who were behind them observed one rak’ah. Then they (those standing in the  second row) came in front and those who were in front went into the rear. He then led  them In one rak’ah. He then sat down, till those who were behind him observed one  rak’ah and then pronounced salutation.

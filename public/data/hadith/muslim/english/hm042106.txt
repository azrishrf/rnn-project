4|2106|  Chapter: Supplication for the dead in the funeral prayer.  ‘Anas b. Malik said: I heard the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) say (while  offering prayer on a dead body): O Allah ! forgive him, have mercy upon him. Give him  peace and absolve him. Receive him with honour and make his grave spacious. Wash  him with water, snow and hail, cleanse him from faults as is cleaned a white garment  from impurity. Requite him with an abode more excellent than his abode, with a family  better than his family, and with a mate better than his mate, and save him from the trial  of the grave and torment of Hell. ‘Auf b. Malik said: I earnestly desired that I were the  dead person to receive the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  as this dead body had (received).

30|5666|  Chapter: The reliance of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on Allah the Exalted, and  Allah’s protecting him against the people.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah al-Ansiri, who was one amongst the Companions of Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him), reported that he went on an expedition along with Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) towards Najd and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stayed there, and  when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came back he also came back along with him.  They, for one day, stayed for rest; the rest of the hadith is the same.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

40|6819|  Chapter: The haughty and the proud would Set into the fire of hell and the humble and meek  would get into Paradise.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The Hell  and the Paradise fell into dispute and the Hell said: I have been distinguished by the  proud and the haughty. And the Paradise said: What is the matter with me that the  meek and the humble amongst people and the downtrodden and the simple enter me?  Thereupon Allah said to the Paradise: You are (the means) of My Mercy whereby I  show mercy to those of My servants whom I wish, and He said to the Hell: You are (the  means) of punishment whereby I punish those of My servants whom wish. Both of you  will be full. The Hell will riot be filled up until Allah puts down His foot in it. The Hell  would say: Enough, enough, enough, and at that time it will be filled up, all its parts  integrated together.         INTIMATES

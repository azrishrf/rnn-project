7|2656|  Chapter: What is permitted for the Muhrim (wearer of Ihram) in Hajj and Umra, what is  not permissible and forbiddance of the use of perfume.         Safwan b. Ya’la b. Umayya reported that Ya’la used to say to ‘Umar b. Khattab (Allah be  pleased with him): Would that I see revelation descending upon the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him). (Once) when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  was in Ji’rana and there was a cloth which provided shade over him, and there were his  Companions with him. ‘Umar being one of them, there came a person with a cloak of  wool on him daubed with perfume and he said: Messenger of Allah, what about the  person who, entered upon the state of Ihram with a cloak after daubing it with perfume?  The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) looked at him for a short while, and then  became quiet, and revelation began descending upon him, and ‘Umar gestured (with his  hand) to Ya’la b Umayya to come. Ya’la came and he entered his head (beneath the  cloth and saw) the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) with his face red, and  breathing with a snore. Then he felt relieved (of that burden) and he said: Where is the  man who was just asking me about Umra? The man was searched for and he was  brought, and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: So far as the perfume  is concerned, wash it three times, and remove the cloak too (as it was sewn) and do in  ‘Umra as you do in Hajj.

7|2698|  Chapter: Applying of perfume to the body before entering upon the state of Ihram.  Muhammad b. al-Muntashir reported on the authority of his father: I asked ‘Abdullah b.  ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) about a person who applied perfume and then (on  the following) morning entered upon the state of Ihram. Thereupon he said: I do not like  to enter upon the state of Ihram shaking off the perfume. Rubbing of tar (upon my body)  is dearer to me than doing this (i.e. the applying of perfume), I went to ‘Aisha (Allah be  pleased with her) and told her that Ibn ‘Umar stated: “I do not like to enter upon the  state of Ihram shaking off the perfume. Rubbing of tar (upon my body) is dearer to me  than doing it (the applying of perfume).” Thereupon ‘Aisha said: I applied perfume to the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) at the time of his entering upon the state  of Ihram. He then went round his wives and then put on Ihram in the morning.

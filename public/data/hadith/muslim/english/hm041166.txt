4|1166|  Chapter: It is forbidden to cry out for finding out the lost thing in the mosque.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  When any one of you is in doubt about his prayer and he does Not know how much he  has prayed, three or four (rak’ahs), he should cast aside his doubt and base his prayer         on what he is sure of, then perform two prostrations before giving salutations. If he has  prayed five rak’ahs, they will make his prayer an even number for him, and if he has  prayed exactly four, they will be humiliation for the devil.

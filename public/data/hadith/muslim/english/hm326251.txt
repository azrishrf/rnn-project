32|6251|  Chapter: It is forbidden to commit oppression.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do you  know who is poor? They (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: A poor man  amongst us is one who has neither dirham with him nor wealth. He (the Holy Prophet)  said: The poor of my Umma would be he who would come on the Day of Resurrection  with prayers and fasts and Zakat but (he would find himself bankrupt on that day as he  would have exhausted his funds of virtues) since he hurled abuses upon others, brought  calumny against others and unlawfully consumed the wealth of others and shed the  blood of others and beat others, and his virtues would be credited to the account of one  (who suffered at his hand). And if his good deeds fall short to clear the account, then his  sins would be entered in (his account) and he would be thrown in the Hell-Fire.           OF RELATIONSHIP

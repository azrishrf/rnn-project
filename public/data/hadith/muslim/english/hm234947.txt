23|4947|  Chapter: It is forbidden to prepare Nabidh is varnished jar, gourd, green pitcher, and hollow  stumps.  Sa’id b. Musayyib reported: I heard ‘Abdullah b ‘Umar saying this near the pulpit while  pointing towards the pulpit of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him): A group of  the tribe of ‘Abd al-Qais came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and  asked him about (vessels) which might (be used for preparing Nabidh and) drinking in  them. He (the Holy Prophet) forbade them (to use) gourd, hollow stump, vessel  besmeared with pitch. I said to him: Abu Muhammad, (what about) varnished jar? and  we think he had forgotten to mention the word ‘varnished jar”. Thereupon he said: I did  not hear it from him on that day, i.e. from ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar, and he hated that (i.e.  preparation of Nabidh in gourd).

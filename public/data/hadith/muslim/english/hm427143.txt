42|7143|  Chapter: It is prohibited to praise anyone so much that there may be fear of his being  intoxicated because of that.  Hammam b. al-Harith reported that a person began to praise ‘Uthman and Miqdad sat  upon his knee; and he was a bulky person and began to throw pebbles upon his  (flatterer’s) face. Thereupon ‘Uthman said: What is the matter with you? And he said:  Verily, Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: When you see those who  shower (undue) praise (upon others), throw dust upon their faces.

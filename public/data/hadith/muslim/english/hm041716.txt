4|1716|  Chapter: Preference for observing Nafl prayer in the house and permissibility of  observing it in the mosque also.  ‘Urwa b. Zubair reported that ‘Aisha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be  upon him), told him that (once) Haula’ dint Tuwait b. Habib b. Asad b. ‘Abd al-‘Uzzi  passed by her (at the time) when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was  with her. I (‘Aisha) said: It Is Haula’ bint Tuwait and they say that she does not sleep at  night. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: (Oh) she does  not sleep at night ! Choose an act which you are capable of doing (continuously). By  Allah, Allah would not grow weary, but you will grow weary.

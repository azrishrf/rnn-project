4|1759|  Chapter: Excellence of the recitation of the Qur’an in prayer and that of its learning.  An-Nawwas b. Sam’an said he heard the Apostle (may peace be upon him) say: On the  Day of Resurrection the Qur’an and those who acted according to it will be brought with  Surah Al-Baqara and Al-‘Imran preceding them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) likened them to three things, which I did not forget afterwards. He (the Holy  Prophet) likened them to two clouds, or two black canopies with light between them, or  like two flocks of birds in ranks pleading for one who recited them.

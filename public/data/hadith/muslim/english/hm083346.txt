8|3346|  Chapter: When one is invited to a wedding feast, one should accept it.  Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon  him) said: When any one of you is invited to a feast, he should accept it. He may eat if  he likes, or he may abandon (eating) if he likes. Ibn Mathanni did not make mention of  the word “feast”.

23|4879|  Chapter: Forbiddance of wine.  ‘Ali b. Abu Talib reported; There fell to my lot along with Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) an old she-camel from the spoils of Badr. Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) granted me another camel. I made them kneel down one day at the door  of an Ansari, and I wanted to carry on them Idhkhir (a kind of grass) in order to sell that.  There was with me a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa’. I sought to give a wedding feast  (on the occasion of marriage with) Fatima with the help of that (the price accrued from  the sale of this grass). And Hamza b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib was busy in drinking in that house  in the company of a singing girl who was singing to him. She said: Hamza, get up for  slaughtering the fat she-camels. Hamza attacked them with the sword and cut off their  humps and ripped their haunches, and then took out their livers. I said to Ibn Shihab:  Did he take out anything from the hump? He said: He cut off the humps altogether. Ibn  Shihab reported ‘Ali having said: I saw this (horrible) sight and it shocked me, and I  came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and there was Zaid b, Haritha with  him and communicated to him this news. He came in the company of Zaid and I also  went along with him and he went to Hamza and he expressed anger with him. Hamza  raised his eyes and said: Are you (not) but the servants of my father? Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) turned back on his heels (on hearing this) until he  went away from them.

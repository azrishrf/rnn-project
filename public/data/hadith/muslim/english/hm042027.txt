4|2027|  Chapter: The dead body is punished for the lamentation of his family.  Hisham narrated on the authority of his father that it was mentioned to ‘Aisha that Ibn  ‘Umar had narrated as marfu’ Hadith from the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  that the dead would be punished in the grave because of the lamentation of his family  for him. Upon this she said: He (Ibn ‘Umar) missed (the point). The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) had (in fact) said: He (the dead) is punished for his faults or  for his sins, and the members of his family are waiting for him now. (This  misunderstanding of Ibn ‘Umar is similar to his saying:) The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) stood by the well in which were lying the dead bodies of those  polytheists who had been killed on the Day of Badr, and he said to them what he had to  say, i.e.: They hear what I say. But he (Ibn ‘Umar) misunderstood. The Holy Prophet  (may peace be upon him) had only said: They (the dead) understand that what I used to  say to them was truth. She then recited: “Certainly, thou canst not make the dead hear  the call” (xxvii. 80), nor can you make those hear who are in the graves, nor can you  inform them when they have taken their seats in Hell.

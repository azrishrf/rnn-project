21|4810|  Chapter: Good attitude even in slaughter and killing and sharpening of large knife.  Shaddid b. Aus said: Two are the things which I remember Allahâ€™s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) having said: Verily Allah has enjoined goodness to everything; so  when you kill, kill in a good way and when you slaughter, slaughter in a good way. So  every one of you should sharpen his knife, and let the slaughtered animal die  comfortably.

7|2869|  Chapter: Saying of people to Ibn ‘Abbas: What to this religious verdict of yours that has  engaged the attention of the people?  Ata’ said: Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) used to say that a pilgrim or non- pilgrim (one performing ‘Umar) who circumambulates the House is free from the  responsibility of Ihram. I (Ibn Juraij, one of the narrators) said to ‘Ata’: On what authority  does he (Ibn Abbas) say this? He said: On the authority of Allah’s words: “Then their  place of sacrifice is the Ancient House” (al-Qur’an, xxii. 33). I said: It concerns the time  after staying at ‘Arafat, whereupon he said: Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) had  stated (that the place of sacrifice is the Ancient House); it way be after staying at ‘Arafat  or before (staying there). And he (Ibn Abbas) made this deduction I from the command  of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) when he had ordered to put off Ihram on  the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage.

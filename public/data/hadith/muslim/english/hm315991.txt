31|5991|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her).  ‘Aisha reported that when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out on a  journey, he used to cast lots amongst his wives. Once this lot came out in my favour  and that of Hafsa. They (Hafsi, and ‘Aisha) both went along with him and Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to travel (on camel)when it was night along  with ‘Aisha and talked with her. Hafsa said to ‘Aisha: Would you like to ride upon my  camel tonight and allow me to ride upon your camel and you would see (what you do  not generally see) and I would see (what I do not see) generally? She said: Yes. So  ‘Aisha rode upon the camel of Hafsa and Hafsa rode upon the camel of ‘Aisha and  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came near the camel of ‘Aisha. (whereas)  Hafsa had been riding over that. He greeted her and then rode with her until they came  down. She (‘Aisha) thus missed (the company of the Holy Prophet) and when they sat  down, ‘Aisha felt jealous. She put her foot in the grass and said: O Allah, let the  scorpion sting me or the serpent bite me. And so far as thy Messenger is concerned, I  cannot say anything about him.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

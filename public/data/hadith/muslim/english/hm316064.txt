31|6064|  Chapter: The merits of Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him).  Anas b. Malik said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) passed (by our house)  that my mother Umm Sulaim listened to his voice and said: Allah’s Messenger, let my         father and mother be sacrificed for thee, here is Unais (and requested him to invoke  blessings upon me). So Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) invoked three  blessings upon me. I have seen (the results) of the two in this very world (in regard to  wealth and progeny) and I hope to see (the result) of the third one in the Hereafter.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

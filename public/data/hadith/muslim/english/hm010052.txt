1|52|  Chapter: He who meets his Lord with implicit faith would enter Heaven and fire would  be forbidden to harm him.  It is narrated on the authority of â€˜Itban b. Malik that he came to Medina and said:  Something had gone wrong with my eyesight. I, therefore, sent (a message to the Holy  Prophet): Verily it is my ardent desire that you should kindly grace my house with your  presence and observe prayer there so, that I should make that corner a place of  worship. He said: The Prophet (may peace be upon him) came there, and those  amongst the Companions whom Allah willed also accompanied him. He entered (my  place) and offered prayer at my residence and his Companions began to talk amongst  themselves (and this conversation centred round hypocrites), and then the conspicuous  one, Malik b. Dukhshum was made the target and they wished that he (the Holy  Prophet) should curse him and he should die or he should meet some calamity. In the         meanwhile the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) completed  his prayer and said: Does Malik b. Dukhshum not testify the fact that there is no god but  Allah and verily I am the messenger of Allah. They replied: He makes a profession of it  (no doubt) but does not do it out of (sincere) heart. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He who  testifies that there is no god but Allah and I am the messenger of Allah would not enter  Hell or its (flames) would not consume him. Anas said: This hadith impressed me very  much and I told my son to write it down.

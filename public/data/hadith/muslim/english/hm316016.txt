Abdullah reported that when this verse was revealed: “There is no harm on persons  who believe and perform good acts, what they had eaten (formerly) when they avoided  it (now) and they affirmed their faith” (v. 93) up to the end. Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said to me: You are one amongst them.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

1|234|  Chapter: Whenever a person intends to do a good deed, it is recorded, but whenever  he intends to commit evil, it is not written.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) observed: Allah, the Great and Glorious, said: Whenever my bondsman  intends to do good, but does not do it, I write one good act for him, but if he puts it into  practice I wrote from ten to seven hundred good deeds in favour of him. When he  intends to commit an evil, but does not actually do it, do not record it. But if he does it, I  write only one evil.

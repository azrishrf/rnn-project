33|6440|  Chapter: The span of life and livelihood does not increase or decrease beyond that what is laid  down.  Ibn Mas’dd reported that Umm Habiba said: O Allah, enable me to derive benefit from  my husband, Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and from my father Abu  Sufyan, and from my brother Mu’awiya. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  said to her: Verily, you have asked Allah about the durations of life already set, and the  steps which you would take, and the sustenance’s the share of which is fixed. Nothing  would take place earlier than its due time, and nothing would be deferred beyond that  when it is due. So, if you were to ask Allah about your safety from the torment of Hell- Fire and from the torment of the grave, it would have been better for you. A person said:  Allah’s Messenger, what about those apes and swine which suffered metamorphosis?  Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah, the Exalted and  Glorious, did not destroy a people or did not torment a people, and let their race grow.  Apes and swine had been even before that (when the deniers of truth were tormented  and suffered metamorphosis). This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sufyin  through another chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.

Thereupon he said: You have not been fair to me for I have heard  from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saying: He who built a mosque  for Allah, the Exalted, Allah would build for him a house in Paradise. Bukair said: I think  he (the Holy Prophet) said: While he seeks the pleasure of Allah (by building the  mosque). And in the narration of Ibn ‘Isa (the words are): “(a house) like that (mosque)  in Paradise.”

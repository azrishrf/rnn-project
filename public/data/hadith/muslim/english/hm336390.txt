33|6390|  Chapter: The growth of a child in the womb of a mother and his destiny in regard to his  livelihood, his deeds. both good and evil.  Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who is  the most truthful (of the human beings) and his being truthful (is a fact) said: Verily your  creation is on this wise. The constituents of one of you are collected for forty days in his  mother’s womb in the form of blood, after which it becomes a clot of blood in another  period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump of flesh and forty days later Allah sends  His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his  livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune. By Him, besides Whom  there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people deserving Paradise until  between him and Paradise there remains but the distance of a cubit, when suddenly the  writing of destiny overcomes him and he begins to act like the denizens of Hell and thus  enters Hell, and another one acts in the way of the denizens of Hell, until there remains  between him and Hell a distance of a cubit that the writing of destiny overcomes him  and then he begins to act like the people of Paradise and enters Paradise.

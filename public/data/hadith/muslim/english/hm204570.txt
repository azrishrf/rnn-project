20|4570|  Chapter: Justification for hating the Amirs for violating the laws of the Shari’ah.  It has been narrated (through a different chain of transmitters) on the authority of Umm  Salama (wife of the Holy Prophet) that he said: Amirs will be appointed over you, and  you will find them doing good as well as bad deeds. One who hates their bad deeds is  absolved from blame. One who disapproves of their bad deeds is (also) safe (so far as  Divine wrath is concerned). But one who approves of their bad deeds and imitates them  (is doomed). People asked: Messenger of Allah, shouldn’t we fight against them? He  replied: No, as long as they say their prayer. (“Hating and disapproving” refers to liking  and disliking from the heart.)

4|1388|  Chapter: Permission to remain away from the congregational prayer for any valid reason.  Anas b. Malik reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) wits the  best among people in character. On occasions, the time of prayer would come while he  was in our house. He would then order to spread the mat lying under him. That was  dusted and then water was sprinkled over it. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) then led the prayer and we stood behind him, and that mat was made of the  leaves of date-palm.

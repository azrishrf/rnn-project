9|3588|  Chapter: The right of inheritance of property vests with one who emancipates the slave.  Hisham b. ‘Urwa narrated a hadith like this with the same chain of transmitters except  (with this change) that in the hadith transmitted on the authority of jartr (the words are):  Her (Barira’s) husband was a slave, so Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  gave her the option (either to retain her matrimonial relation with her husband or sever it  off). She opted to break off (and secure freedom for her even from the matrimonial  alliance). And if he were free he would not have given her the option. In the hadith  narrated on the authority (of this chain of transmitters) these words are not found:  Amma ba’du.

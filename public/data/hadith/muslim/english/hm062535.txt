6|2535|  Chapter: Forbiddance to observe fast on ‘Id-ul-Fitr and ‘Id-al-Adha.  Qaza’a related from Abu Sa’id. He said: I heard from him (Abu Sa’id) a Hadith which  impressed me, and I said to him: Did you hear it from the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him)? Thereupon he said: (Is it possible) that (I should) say about the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that which I have not heard? I heard him  saying: It is not proper to fast on two days, Adha and Fitr (at the end) of Ramadan.

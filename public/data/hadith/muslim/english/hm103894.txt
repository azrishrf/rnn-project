10|3894|  Chapter: Hoarding of foodstuff is forbidden.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported this narration from Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) but with this variation that he said: He (the Holy  Prophet) bought the camel from me on a stipulated price. And he did not mention two  ‘uqiyas and a dirham or two dirhams, and he commanded a cow (to be slaughtered) and  it was slaughtered, and he then distributed its flesh.

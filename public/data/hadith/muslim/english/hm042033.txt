4|2033|  Chapter: The dead body is punished for the lamentation of his family.  Abu Malik al-Ash’ari reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  Among my people there are four characteristics belonging to pre-Islamic period which  they do not abandon: boasting of high rank, reviling other peoples’ genealogies, seeking  rain by stars, and walling. And he (further) said: If the wailing woman does not repent  before she dies, she will be made to stand on the Day of Resurrection wearing a  garment of pitch and a chemise of mange.

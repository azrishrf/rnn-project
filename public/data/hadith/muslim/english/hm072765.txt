7|2765|  Chapter: Types of Ihram- It is permissible to enter into the state of Ihram singularly for  the sake of Hajj or for tamattu’ bi’l-‘umra ila’l-Hajj or for both hajj and ‘umra together.  ‘Aisha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), said: We went out with  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) during the year of the Farewell  Pilgrimage. There were some amongst us who had put on Ihram for Umra and there  were some who had put on Ihram for Hajj. (We proceeded on till) we came to Mecca.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who put on Ihram for ‘Umra  but did not bring the sacrificial animal with him should put it off and he who put on Ihram  for Umra and he who had brought the sacrificial animal with him should not put it off  until he had slaughtered the animal; and he who put on ihram for Hajj should complete  it. ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) said: I was in the monthly period, and I remained In  this state till the day of ‘Arafa, and I had entered into the state of Ihram for ‘Umra. The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) thus commanded me to undo my hair and         comb them (again) and enter into the state of Ihram for Hajj, and abandon (the rites of  ‘Umra). She (‘Aisha) said: I did so, and when I had completed my Pilgrimage, the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent with me ‘Abd al-Rabman b. Abu  Bakr and commanded me to (resume the rites of) ‘Umra at Tan’im. the place where (I  abandoned) ‘Umra and put on Ihram for Hajj (before completing Umra).

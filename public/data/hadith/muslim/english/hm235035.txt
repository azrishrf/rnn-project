23|5035|  Chapter: It is desirable to circulate water or milk (in an assembly) from the right-hand side of  the one who serves.  Sahl b. Sa’d Sa’idi reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was given  a drink, and he drank from that, and there was on his right side a boy and on his left  some old men. He said to the boy: Do you permit me to give it to them (the old men),  but that boy said: by God. I will not give preference at your hand over me in my share.  He (the narrator) said that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then gave it in  his hand.

20|4635|  Chapter: The merit of Martyrdom.  It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik (through a different chain of  transmitters) that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Nobody who  enters Paradise will (ever like to) return to this world even if he were offered everything  on the surface of the earth (as an inducement) except the martyr who will desire to  return to this world and be killed ten times for the sake of the great honour that has  been bestowed upon him.

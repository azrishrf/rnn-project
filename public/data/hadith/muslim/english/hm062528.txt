6|2528|  Chapter: On which day the fast is to be observed in Muharram.  Ibn ‘Abbas reported that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) fasted  on the day of ‘Ashura and commanded that it should he observed as a fast, they (his  Companions) said to him: Messenger of Allah, it is a day which the Jews and Christians  hold in high esteem. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  When the next year comes, God willing, we would observe fast on the 9th But the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) died before the advent of the next year.

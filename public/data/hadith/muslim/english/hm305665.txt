30|5665|  Chapter: The reliance of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on Allah the Exalted, and  Allah’s protecting him against the people.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported: We went along with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on  an expedition towards Najd and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) found us in a valley  abounding in thorny trees. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stayed for rest under a  tree  and  he  suspended his  sword  by  one  of  its branches under  which  he  was  taking rest.  The  persons scattered in the valley and they also began to take rest under the shade of trees, and  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: A person came to me while I was asleep and  he  took  hold  of  the  sword.  I  woke up  and  found  him  standing  upon  my  head  and  I  had  hardly         become alert (and saw) that the sword was in his hand. And he said: Who can protect you from  me? I said: Allah. He again said: Who can protect you from me? I said: Allah. He put his sword in  the sheath (and you can see) this man sitting here. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  did not in any way touch him.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

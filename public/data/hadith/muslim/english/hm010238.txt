1|238|  Chapter: Whenever a person intends to do a good deed, it is recorded, but whenever  he intends to commit evil, it is not written.  This hadith has been narrated with another chain of transmitters with the addition of  these words: Allah would even wipe out (the evil committed by a man) and Allah does  not put to destruction anyone except he who is doomed to destruction.

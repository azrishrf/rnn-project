7|2711|  Chapter: Hunting is forbidden for one who is in the state of Ihram.  â€˜Abdullah b. Abu. Qatada reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with  him): The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) set out for Pilgrimage and we  also set out along with him. He (Abu Qatada) said: There proceeded on some of his  Companions and Abu Qatada was (one of them). He,(the Holy Prophet) said: You  proceed along the coastline till you meet me. He (Abfl Qatida) said: So they proceeded  ahead of the Prophet of God (may peace be upon him), all of them had entered upon  the state of Ihram, except Abu Qatada; he had not put on ihram. As they went on they  saw a wild ass, and Abu Qatada attacked it and cut off its hind legs. They got down and  ate its meat. They said: We ate meat In the state of Ihram. They carried the meat that  was left of it. As they came to the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) they  said: Messenger of Allah, we were in the state of Ihram where as Abu Qatada was not.  We saw a wild ass and Abu Qatada attacked it and cut off its hind legs. We got down  and ate its meat and we thus ate the meat of a game while we were In the state of         Ihram. We have (carried to you) what was left out of its meat. There upon he (the holy  Prophet) said: Did anyone among you command him (to hunt) or point to him with  anything (to do so)? They said: No. There upon he said: Then eat what is left out of its  meat.

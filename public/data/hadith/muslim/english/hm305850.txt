30|5850|  Chapter: Pertaining to the merits of Moses (peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported that Moses was a modest person. He was never seen naked and  Banu Isra’il said: (He was afraid to expose his private part) because he had been  suffering from scrotal hernia. He (one day) took bath in water and placed his garments  upon a stone. The stone began to move on quickly. He followed that and struck it with  the help of a stone (saying): O stone, my garment; O stone, my garments, O stone; until  it stopped near the big gathering of Isra’il, and this verse was revealed (pertaining to the  incident): “O you who believe, be not like those who maligned Moses, but Allah cleared  him of what they said, and he was worthy of regard with Allah” (xxxiii. 69).

6|2591|  Chapter: Forbiddance to observe perpetual fast and excellence of observing fast on alternate  days.  Abdu’llah b. ‘Amr b. ‘As (Allah be pleased with them) reported: It was conveyed to the  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) that I observe fast successively and pray  during the whole night. He sent for me or I met him and he (the Holy Prophet) said: It  has been conveyed to me that you observe fast continuously and do not break it and  pray during the whole night. Don’t do that. for there is share for your eyes, share for  your own self, share for your family; so observe fast and break it, pray and sleep and  observe fast for one day during the ten days, and there is a reward for you (for other)  nine (days besides the tenth day of the fast). I said: Apostle of Allah, I find myself more  powerful than this. He said: Then observe the fast of David (peace be upon him). He  (‘Amr) said: Apostle of Allah, how did David observe fast? He (the Holy Prophet) said:         He used to fast one day and break it on the other day, and he did not run (from the  battlefield) as he encountered (the enemy). He said: Apostle of Allah, who can  guarantee this for me (will I also encounter the enemy dauntlessly)? ‘Ata’, the narrator  of the Hadith, said: I do not know how there (crept in) the matter of perpetual fast. The  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), however, said: He who observed perpetual  fast did not fast at all; he who observed perpetual fast did not fast at all, he who  observed perpetual fast did not fast at all. This Hadith has been narrated by Ibn Juraij  with the same chain of transmitters. Imam Muslim has narrated this Hadith on the  authority of Abu ‘Abbas al-Sa’ib b. Farrukh and he was a trustworthy and reliable  (narrator) among the people of Mecca.

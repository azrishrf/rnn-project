30|5814|  Chapter: The knowledge of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) about Allah and his  utmost fear of him.  ‘Aisha reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did an act, and held it to  be valid. This news reached some persons amongst his Companions (and it was felt)  that they did not approve of it and avoided (it). This reaction of theirs was conveyed to  him. He stood to deliver an address; and said: What has happened to the people to  whom there was conveyed on my behalf a matter for which I granted permission and         they disapproved it and avoided it? By Allah, I have the best knowledge of Allah  amongst them, and I fear Him most amongst them.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

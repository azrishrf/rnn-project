10|3736|  Chapter: Leasing out land.  Nafi reported that Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) rented his land during the  lifetime of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and during the caliphate of Abu  Bakr and that of Umar and that of Uthman (Allah be pleased with them) and during the  early period of Muawiya’s caliphate until at the end of Muawiya’s reign, it reached him  (Ibn ‘Umar) that Rafi b. Khadij (Allah be pleased with him) narrated (a hadith) in which  (there was a decree) of prohibition by Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him). He (Ibn  ‘Umar) went to him (Rafi b. Khadij) and I was with him and he asked him, whereupon he  said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to forbid the renting of land. So  Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) abandoned it, and subsequently whenever he  was asked about it, he said: Rafi b. Khadij (Allah be pleased with him) alleged that  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade it.

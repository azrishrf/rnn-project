5|2232|  Chapter: Concerning the collection of Sadaqa and doing of good deeds.  ‘Aisha reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When a woman  gives in charity some of the food in her house, without causing any damage, there is  reward for her for whatever she has given, and a reward for her husband for what he  earned. The same applies to the trustee. In no respect does the one diminish the  reward of the other.

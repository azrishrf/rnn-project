20|4647|  Chapter: One who is killed in the way of Allah will have all his sins blotted out except  debt.         The tradition has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters on the authority  of Abu Qatada who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) while he was on the pulpit and said: Do you think if I am killed in the way of Allah...  (except this difference in its beginning, the rest of the tradition is the same as the  previous one).

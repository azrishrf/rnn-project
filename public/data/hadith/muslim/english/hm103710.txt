10|3710|  Chapter: Forbiddance of al-Mubiqala, and al-Muzabana, and al-Mukhabara and the  sale of fruits before their good condition is clear, and al-Mu’awama, i.e., the sale for  some years.  Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) forbidding Muhaqala, and Muzabana, and Mukhabara, and the buying of  date-palm until its fruit is ripened (ripening means that its colour becomes red or yellow,  or it is fit for being eaten). And Muhaqala implies that crops in the field are bought for  grains according to a customary measure. Muzabana implies that date-palm should be  sold for dry dates by measuring them with wisqs, and al-Mukhabara is (a share), maybe  one-third or one-fourth (in produce) or something like it. Zaid (one of the narrators) said  to Ata’ b. Abu Rabah (the other narrator): Did You bear Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be  pleased with them) making a mention of it that he had heard it directly from Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him)? He said: Yes.

31|5958|  Chapter: Merits of Zaid b. Harith and Usama b. Zaid (Allah be pleased with them).  Ibn ‘Umar reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent an expedition  and appointed Usama b. Zaid as its chief. The people objected to his command,  whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up and said: You object  to his command and before this you objected to the command of his father (Zaid). By  Allah, he was fit as the commander and he was one of the dearest of persons to me and  after him, behold! this one (Usama) is one of the dearest of persons to me.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

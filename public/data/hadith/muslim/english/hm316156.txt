31|6156|  Chapter: The merits of the companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and of  those who are next to them and then of those who are next to them.  Imran b. Husain reported Allah’s-Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The  best among you (are) the people (who belong to) my age. Then those next to them,  then those next to them, then those next to them. ‘Imran said: I do not know whether  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said twice or thrice (the words: “Then  next”) after (saying) about his (own age but he then said): Then after them (after  successors or those who would succeed them) would come a people who would give  evidence before they are asked for it, and would be dishonest and not trustworthy, who  would make vows but would not fulfil them, and would be significant in being bulky.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

31|6166|  Chapter: Meaning of the saying of the Prophet (may peace be upon him): “No person would  survive after a century who is living by this time of mine”.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: None  amongst the created beings (from my Companions) would survive after one hundred  years. Salim said: We made a mention of it to him (Jabir), whereupon he said: It means  those who had been living on that day.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

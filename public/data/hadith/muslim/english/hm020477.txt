2|477|  Chapter: It is commendable to include forehead in washing the face and elbow and  ankle in washing the hands and feet, while performing ablution.  Nu’aim b. ‘Abdullah al-Mujmir reported: I saw Abu Huraira perform ablution. He washed  his face and washed it well. He then washed his right hand including a portion of his  arm. He then washed his left hand including a portion of his arm. He then wiped his  head. He then washed his right foot including his shank, and then washed his left foot  including shank, and then said: This is how I saw Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) perform his ablution. And (Abu Huraira) added that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) had observed: You shall have your faces hands and feet  bright on the Day of Resurrection because of your perfect ablution. He who can afford  among you, let him increase the brightness of his forehead and that of hands and legs.

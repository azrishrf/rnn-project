8|3450|  Chapter: Sharing visits to one’s wives equally.  Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him)  had nine wives. So when he divided (his stay) with them, the turn of the first wife did not  come but on the ninth (day). They (all the wives) used to gather every night in the house  of one where he had to come (and stay that night). It was (the night when he had to  stay) in the house of ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her), when Zainab came there. He  (the Holy Prophet) stretched his hand towards her (Zainab), whereupon she (‘Aisha)  said: It is Zainab. Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) withdrew his hand. There  was an altercation between the two until their voices became loud (and it was at that  time) when Iqama was pronounced for prayer. There happened to come Abu Bakr and  he heard their voices and said: Messenger of Allah, (kindly) come for prayer, and throw  dust in their mouths. So the Prophet (May peace be upon him) went out. ‘Aisha said:  When Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) would finish his prayer there would also  come Abu Bakr and he would do as he does (on such occasions i.e. reprimanding).  When Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, there came to  her Abu Bakr and spoke to her (‘Aisha) in stern words and said: Do you behave like  this?

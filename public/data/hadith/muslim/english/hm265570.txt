26|5570|  Chapter: It is forbidden to kill the cat.  Nafi’ reported from ‘Abdullah that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: A  woman was punished because she had kept a cat tied until it died, and (as a  punishment of this offence) she was thrown into the Hell. She had not provided it with  food, or drink, and had not freed her so that she could eat the insects of the earth.

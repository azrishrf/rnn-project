30|5761|  Chapter: The fragrance of the sacred body of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its  agility and softness and the blessings of its touch.  Anas b. Malik reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) used to come to  our house and there was perspiration upon his body. My mother brought a bottle and  began to pour the sweat in that. When Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) got up  he said: Umm Sulaini, what is this that you are doing? Thereupon she said: That is your  sweat which we mix in our perfume and it becomes the most fragrant perfume.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

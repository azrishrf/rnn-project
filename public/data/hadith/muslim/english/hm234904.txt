23|4904|  Chapter: It is not approved to prepare Nabidh by mixing dry dates and grapes.  Abu Qatada, on the authority of his father, reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) having said this: Do not prepare Nabidh by mixing nearly ripe dates and fresh  dates together, and do not prepare Nabidh by mixing grapes and dates together, but  prepare Nabidh from each (one of them) separately.

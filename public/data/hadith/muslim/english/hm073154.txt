7|3154|  Chapter: Eminence of Medina, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) showered  blessings upon it. Its sacredness and unlawfulness of hunting and lopping of trees and  demarcation its precincts.  Amir b. Sa’d reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with him) that  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I have declared sacred the territory  between the two lava plains of Medina, so its trees should not be cut down, or its game  killed; and he also said: Medina is best for them if they knew. No one leaves it through  dislike of it without Allah putting in it someone better than he in place of him; and no one  will stay there in spite of its hardships and distress without my being an intercessor or  witness on behalf of him on the Day of Resurrection.

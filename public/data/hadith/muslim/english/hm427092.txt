42|7092|  Chapter: Not known.  ‘Aisha used to say to ‘Urwa: Son of my sister, by Allah, I used to see the new moon,  then the new moon, then the new moon, i.e. three moons in two months, and fire was  not kindled in the house of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him).I (‘Urwa) said:  Auntie, then what were your means of sustenance? She said: Dates and water. But it  (so happened) that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had some Ansar as his  neighbours and they had milch animals and they used to send to Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) some milk of their (animals) and he served that to us.

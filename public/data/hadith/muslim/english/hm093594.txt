9|3594|  Chapter: The right of inheritance of property vests with one who emancipates the slave.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her), the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may Peace be upon him)  said: Three are the Sunan (usages) (that we came to know in case of Bairara). She was  given option in regard to her husband when she was emancipated. She was given meat  as charity. Allah’s Messenger (way peace be upon him) visited me when an earthen pot  with meat in it was placed on the fire. He asked for food and be was given bread with  ordinary meat (usually cooked in the) house. Thereupon he (Allah’s Messenger) said:  Don’t I see the earthen pot on fire with meat in it? They said: Yes. Allah’s Messenger,  there is meat in it which was given as charity to Barira. We did not deem it advisable  that we should give you that to eat, whereupon he said: It is charity for her, but it is gift  for us. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) also said: The right of inheritance vests  with one who emancipates.

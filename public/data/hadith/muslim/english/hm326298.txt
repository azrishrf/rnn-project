32|6298|  Chapter: He upon whom Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) invoked curse  whereas he in fact did not deserve it, it would be a source of reward and mercy for him.  Ibn Abbas reported: I was playing with children that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) happened to pass by (us). I hid myself behind the door. He (the Holy  Prophet) came and he patted upon my shoulders and said: Go and call Mu’awiya. I  returned and said: He is busy in taking food. He again asked me to go and call  Mu’swiya to him. I went (and came back) and said that he was busy in taking food,  whereupon he said: May Allah not fill his belly! Ibn Muthanna, said: I asked Umm  Umayya what he meant by the word Hatani. He said: It means “he patted my  shoulders”.  OF RELATIONSHIP

4|1230|  Chapter: Desirability of seeking refuge from the torment of the grave.  Mughira b. Shu’ba wrote to Mu’awiya: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) finished the prayer and pronounced salutation he uttered (this supplication):  “There is no god but Allah. He is alone, Who has no partner. To Him belongs the  sovereignty and to Him praise is due and He is Potent over everything. O Allah! no one  can withhold what Thou givest, or give what Thou withholdest, and the riches cannot  avail a wealthy person with Thee.”

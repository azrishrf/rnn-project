21|4800|  Chapter: Pertaining to the flesh of the Lizard.  Abu Sa’id reported that an Arab of the desert came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) and said: I live in a low land abounding in lizards, and these are the  common diet of my family, but he (the Holy Prophet) did not make any reply. We said to  him: Repeat it (your problem) and so he repeated it, but he did not make any reply. (It  was repeated thrice) Then Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called him out  at the third time saying: O man of the desert, verily Allah cursed or showed wrath to a  tribe of Bani Isra’il and distorted them to beasts which move on the earth. I do not know,  perhaps this (lizard) may be one of them. So I do not eat it, nor do I prohibit the eating  of it.

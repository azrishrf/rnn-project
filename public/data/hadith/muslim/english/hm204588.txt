20|4588|  Chapter: It is good on the part of a leader to take the oath of allegiance from his forces  when intending to fight, and an account of the allegiance of God’s pleasure under the  tree.  It has been narrated on the authority of Sa’id b. Musayyab who said: My father was one  of those who swore fealty to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) near the  tree. When we passed that way next year intending to perform the Hajj, the place of the  tree was hidden to us. If you could point out clearly, you would (certainly) be knowing  better.  It has also been narrated on the authority of Sa’id b. Musayyib who learnt from his  father that they were with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the year  of the Tree (i.e. in the year of the fealty of God’s pleasure sworn under the tree at  Hudaibiya), but next year they forgot the spot of the tree.

22|4821|  Chapter: The proper time for sacrifice.  Jundab al-Bajali reported: I saw Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) observing  (‘Id) prayer on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu’l-Hijja) and then delivering a sermon         and he said: He who sacrificed the (animal) before offering (‘Id) prayer, he should offer  again in its stead, and he who did not sacrifice the animal should slaughter it by reciting  the name of Allah.

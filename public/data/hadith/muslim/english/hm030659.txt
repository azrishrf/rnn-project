3|659|  Chapter: The woman who has a prolonged flow of blood, her bathing and prayer.  â€˜Aisha, the wife of the Apostle (may peace be upon him), said: Umm Habiba b. Jahsh  who was the spouse of Abd al- Rahman b. Auf made a complaint to the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) about blood (which flows beyond the menstrual period).  He said to her: Remain away (from prayer) equal (to the length of time) that your  menstruation holds you back. After this, bathe yourself. And she washed herself before  every prayer.

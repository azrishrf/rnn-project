24|5287|  Chapter: It is forbidden to beat the animal on the face or cauterise at the face.  Anas reported: We went to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he was in  the fold and he was cauterising the animals of the flock and I think (he was cauterising  them) on their ears. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu’ba through  another chain of transmitters.

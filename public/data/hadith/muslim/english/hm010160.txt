1|160|  Chapter: Major sins and the gravest among these.  Ubaidullah b. Abu Bakr said: I heard Anas b. Malik saying: The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) talked about the major sins, or he was asked about the major  sins. Upon this he observed: Associating anyone with Allah, killing of a person,  disobedience to parents. He (the Holy Prophet further) said: Should I not inform you  about the gravest of the major sins, and (in this connection) observed: False utterance  or false testimony. Shu’ba said: It was most probably “false testimony”.

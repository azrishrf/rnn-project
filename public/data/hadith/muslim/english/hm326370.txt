32|6370|  Chapter: The merit of one who resigns himself to the will of God calmly at the time of  the death of one’s son.  Abu Hassan reported: I said to Abu Huraira that my two children had died. Would you  narrate to me anything from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) a hadith  which would soothe our hearts in our bereavements? He said: Yes. Small children are  the fowls of Paradise. If one of them meets his father (or he said his parents) he would  take hold of his cloth, or he said with his hand as I take hold of the hem of your cloth  (with my hand). And he (the child) would not take off (his hand) from it until Allah causes  his father to enter Paradise. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Tamim  with the same chain of transmitters. And he is reported to have said: Did you hear from  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) anything which may soothe our heart in  our bereavements? He said: Yes.               OF RELATIONSHIP

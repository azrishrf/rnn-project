4|1659|  Chapter: The most excellent prayer is one in which one stands for a longer time.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah  descends to the lowest heaven at half of the night or at one-third of the latter part and  says: Who is there to supplicate Me so that I answer him? Who is there to ask Me so  that I grant him? And then says: Who will lend to One Who is neither indigent nor  tyrant? (This Hadith has been narrated by Sa’d b. Sa’id with the same chain of  transmitters with this addition: “Then the Blessed and the Exalted (Lord) stretches His  Hands and says: Who will lend to One Who is neither indigent nor tyrant?)

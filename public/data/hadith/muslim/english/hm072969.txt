7|2969|  Chapter: It is excellent that the aged and the weak, especially among the women,  should hasten from Muzdalifa to Mina at the latter part of the night before the people  moving in multitude. and excellence of staying there for others until they observe the  dawn prayer at Muzdalifa.  Salim b. ‘Abdullah reported that ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) used to  send ahead of him the weak members of his household to stay during the night at  Mash’ar al-Haram at Muzdalifa. They remembered Allah so long as they could afford,  and then they proceeded before the stay of the Imam, and before his return. So some of  them reached Mina for the dawn prayer and some of them reached there after that; and  as they reached there, they stoned al-Jamra; and Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with         them) used to say: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has granted this  concession to them.

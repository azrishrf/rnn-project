32|6197|  Chapter: Joining the tie of, relationship and prohibition to break it.  Abu Huraira reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Verily  Allah created the universe and when He had finished that, ties of relationship came  forward and said This is the place for him who seeks refuge from severing (of blood- relationship). He said: Yes. Are you not satisfied that I should keep relationship with one  who joins your ties of relationship and sever it with one who severs your (ties of  relationship)? They (the ties of blood) said: Certainly so. Thereupon He said: Well, that  is how things are for you. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then said: Recite  if you like: “But if you turn away you are sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the  ties of kinship. Those it is whom Allah has cursed, so He has made them deaf and  blinded their eyes. Do they not reflect on the Qur’an? Or, are there locks on their  hearts?”.  OF RELATIONSHIP

7|2655|  Chapter: What is permitted for the Muhrim (wearer of Ihram) in Hajj and Umra, what is  not permissible and forbiddance of the use of perfume.  Safwan b. Ya’la reported on the authority of his father (who said): A person came to the  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as he was staying at Ji’rana and I (the  narrator’s father) was at that time in the apostle’s (may peace be upon him) company  and (the person) was donning a cloak having the marks of perfume on it, and he said: I  am in a state of Ihram for the sake of Umra, and it (this cloak) is upon me and I am  perfumed. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to him: What would you  do in your Hajj? He said: I would take off the clothes and would wash from me this  perfume. Thereupon the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What you do in  your Hajj do it in your Umra.

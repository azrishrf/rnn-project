24|5275|  Chapter: Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.  Abu Zur’a reported: I visited the house of Marwan in the company of Abu Huraira and  he found pictures there, whereupon he said: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, said: Who is a more wrongdoer  than one who tries to create creation like Mine creation. Let him create an atom or a  grain of wheat or that of barley. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu  Zur’a and he said: Abu Huraira went to the house of Sa’ld or Marwan which they had  built in Medina and he (Abu Huraira) saw a painter who had been painting pictures in  his house, whereupon he told that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had  said like this, but he made no mention of the words: “Let him create the grain of barley.”

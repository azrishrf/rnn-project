7|3212|  Chapter: The merit of praying in the two mosques, at Mecca and Medina.  Yahya b. Sa’id (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said to Abu Salih: Did you hear  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) making a mention of the excellence of prayer in  the mosque of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? He said: No (I did not hear  directly from Abu Huraira), but I heard Abdullah b. Ibrahim b. Qariz; say that’ he had  heard from Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) that Allah’s Messenger(may peace  be upon him) had said: Prayer in this mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers  or is like one thousand prayers observed in other mosques besides It, except that it be  in al-Masjid al-Haram. This Hadith has been narrated by Yahya b. Sa’id with the same  chain of transmitters.

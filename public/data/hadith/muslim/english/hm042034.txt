4|2034|  Chapter: The dead body is punished for the lamentation of his family.  ‘Aisha reported that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was told  that Ibn Haritha, Ja’far b. Abu Talib and Abdullah b. Rawaha were killed, he sat down,  showing signs of grief. She (further) said: I was looking (at him) through the crevice of  the door. A man came to him and mentioned that Ja’far’s women were lamenting. He  (the Holy Prophet) commanded him to go and forbid them (to do so). So he went away  but came back and told (him) that they did not obey (him). He commanded him a  second time to go and forbid them (to do so). He again went but came back to him and  said: I swear by God, Messenger of Allah, that they have overpowered us. She (‘Aisha)  said that she thought the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had told (her) to  throw dust in their mouths. Thereupon ‘Aisha said: May Allah humble you ! You did not  do what Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) ordered you, nor did you stop  annoying Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him).

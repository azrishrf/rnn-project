1|151|  Chapter: Belief in Allah is the best of deeds.  It is narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud that he observed. I asked the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) which deed was the best. He (the Holy  Prophet) replied: Prayer at its appointed hour. I (again) said: Then what? He (the Holy  Prophet) replied: Kindness to the parents. I (again) said: Then what? He replied:  Earnest endeavour (Jihad) in the cause of Allah. And I would have not ceased asking  more questions but out of regard (for his feelings).

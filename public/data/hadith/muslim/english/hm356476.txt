35|6476|  Chapter: The names of Allah, the Exalted, and the merit of one who enumerates them.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: Verily, there  are ninety-nine names for Allah, i.e. hundred excepting one. He who enumerates them  would get into Paradise. And Hammam has made this addition on the authority of Abu  Huraira who reported it from Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) that he said: “He  is Odd (one) and loves odd number.”  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

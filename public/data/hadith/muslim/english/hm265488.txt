26|5488|  Chapter: Treatment with the help of Indians Aloeswood.  Umm Qais, daughter of Mihsan, was one of the earlier female emigrants who had  pledged allegiance to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). She was the sister  of Ukisha b. Mihsan, one of the posterity of Asad b. Khuzaima. She reported that she  came to Allah’s messenger (may peace be upon him) along with her son who had not  attained the age of weaning and she had compressed the swelling of his uvula. (Yunus  said: She compressed the uvula because she was afraid that there might be swelling of  uvula.) Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Why do you afflict  your children by compressing in this way? You should use Indian aloeswood, for it has  seven remedies in it, one of them being the remedy for pleurisy. Ubaidullah reported  that she had told that that was the child who pissed in the lap of Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him), and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called for  water and sprinkled it on his urine, but he did not wash it well.

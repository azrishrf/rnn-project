31|6173|  Chapter: Instructions of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) in regard to the people of  Egypt.         Abu Dharr reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: You would  soon conquer a land where people are in the habit of using foul language. They have a  right of kinship upon you. And when you see two persons fighting for the space of a  brick, then get out of that. He (Abu Dharr) then happened to pass by Rabila and ‘Abd al- Rahman, the two sons of Shurahbil b. Hasana, and they had been disputing for the  space of a brick. So he left the land.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

8|3232|  Chapter: One who can support a wife should marry.  ‘Alqama reported: While I was going along with ‘Abdullah b. Ma’sud (Allah he pleased  with him) in Mina, ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan (Allah be pleased with him) happened to meet him  and said: Come here, Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman (kunya of Abdullah b. Ma’sud), and he  isolated him (from me), and when ‘Abdullah (b. Ma’sud) saw that there was no need (for  this privacy), he said to me: ‘Alqama, come on, and so I went there. (Then) ‘Uthman  said to him: Abu Abd al-Rahman, should we not marry you to a virgin girl that your past  may be recalled to your mind? ‘Abdullah said: If you say so, the rest of the hadith is the  same as narrated above.

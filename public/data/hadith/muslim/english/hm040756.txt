4|756|  Chapter: He who hears the Adhin should respond like it, invoke blessings upon the Apostle  (may peace be upon him)and then beg for him the Wasila.  Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle (may peace be upon him) said When the call to  prayer is made, Satan runs back and breaks wind so as not to hear the call being made,  and when the call is finished, he turns round. When Iqama is proclaimed he turns his  back, and when it is finished he turns round to distract a man, saying: Remember such  and such; remember such and such, referring to something the man did not have in his  mind, with the result that he does not know how much he has prayed.

7|2833|  Chapter: The Qarin should not put off the Ihram but at the time when a Mufrid pilgrim  takes it off.  Hafsa (Allah be pleased with her), the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him),  said: Messenger of Allah, what about people who have put off Ihram whereas you have  not put it off after your ‘Umra? He said: I have stuck my hair and have driven my  sacrificial animal, and would not, therefore, put off Ihram until I have sacrificed the  animal.

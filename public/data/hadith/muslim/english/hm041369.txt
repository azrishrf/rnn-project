4|1369|  Chapter: Disapproval of delaying the prayer from the prescribes time; what one who is led in  prayer should do when the Imam delays it ?.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) found some  people absenting from certain prayers and he said: I intend that I order (a) person to  lead people in prayer, and then go to the persons who do not join the (congregational  prayer) and then order their houses to be burnt by the bundles of fuel. If one amongst  them were to know that he would find a fat fleshy bone he would attend the night prayer.

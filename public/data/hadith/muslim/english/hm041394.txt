4|1394|  Chapter: Permissibility of observing Nafl (supererogatory) prayer in congregation and that too  on the mat or the covering cloth or any other thing which is free from filth and rubbish.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A man’s  prayer in congregation is more valuable than twenty degrees and some above them as  compared with his prayer in his house and his market, for when he performs ablution  doing it well, then goes out to the mosque, and he is impelled (to do so) only by (the  love of congregational) prayer, he has no other objective before him but prayer. He         does not take a step without being raised a degree for it and having a sin remitted for it,  till he enters the mosque, and when he is busy in prayer after having entered the  mosque, the angels continue to invoke blessing on him as long as he is in his place of  worship, saying: O Allah, show him mercy, and pardon him ! Accept his repentance  (and the angels continue this supplication for him) so long as he does not do any harm  in it, or as long as his ablution is not broken.

Samura reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as  saying: Before the Last Hour there would be many liars, and there is an addition in the  hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Ahwas of these words: “I said to him: Did you  hear it from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? He said: Yes.”

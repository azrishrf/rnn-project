4|1743|  Chapter: Descending of tranquillity by the recitation of the Qur’an.  Abu Musa al-Ash’ari reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A  believer who recites the Qur’an is like an orange whose fragrance is sweet and whose  taste is sweet; a believer who does not recite the Qur’an is like a date which has no  fragrance but has a sweet taste; and the hypocrite who recites the Qur’an is like a basil  whose fragrance is sweet, but whose taste is bitter; and a hypocrite who does not recite  the Qur’an is like the colocynth which has no fragrance and has a bitter taste.

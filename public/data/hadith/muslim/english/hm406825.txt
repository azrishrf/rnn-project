40|6825|  Chapter: The haughty and the proud would Set into the fire of hell and the humble and meek  would get into Paradise.  ‘Abd al-Wahhab b. Ata’ reported in connection with the words of Allah, the Exalted and  the Glorious: We would say to Hell on the Day of Resurrection: Have you been  completely filled up? and it would say: Is there anything -more? And he stated on the  authority of Anas b. Malik that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: (The  sinners) would be thrown therein and it would continue to say: Is there anything more,  until Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would keep His foot therein and some of its part  would draw close to the other and it would say: Enough, enough, by Thy Honour and by  Thy Dignity, and there would be enough space in Paradise until Allah would create a  new creation and He would make them accommodate that spare place in Paradise.

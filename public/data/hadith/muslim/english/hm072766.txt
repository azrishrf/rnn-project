7|2766|  Chapter: Types of Ihram- It is permissible to enter into the state of Ihram singularly for  the sake of Hajj or for tamattu’ bi’l-‘umra ila’l-Hajj or for both hajj and ‘umra together.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: We went with the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) during the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. I put on Ihram for Umra  and did not bring the sacrificial animal. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  said: He who has the sacrificial animal with him should enter into the state of Ihram for  Hajj along with ‘Umra, and he should not put the Ihram off till he has completed both of  them. She (Hadrat ‘Aisha) said: The monthly period began. When it was the night of  Arafa,I said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him): I entered into the state  of Ihram for ‘Umra, but now how should I perform the Hajj? Thereupon he said: Undo  your hair and comb them, and desist from performing Umra, and put on Ihram for Hajj  She (‘Aisha, said: When I had completed my Hajj he commanded ‘Abd al-Rahman b.  Abu Bakr to carry me behind him (on bone-back) in order to enable me to resume the  rituals of Umra from Tan’im, the place where I abandoned its rituals.

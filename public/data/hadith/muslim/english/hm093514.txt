9|3514|  Chapter: There is no maintenance allowance for one who has been given irrevocable  divorce.  Fatima bint Qais reported that her husband al-Makhzulmi divorced her and refused to  pay her maintenance allowance. So she came to Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace he  upon him) and informed him, whereupon he said: There is no maintenance allowance  for you, and you better go to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum and live with him for he is a  blind man and you can put off your clothes in his house (i.e. you shall not face much  difficulty in observing purdah there).

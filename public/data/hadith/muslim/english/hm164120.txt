16|4120|  Chapter: Al-Qasamah.  Sahl. b. Abu Hathma and Rafi’ b. Khadij reported that Muhayyisa b. Mas’ud and  ‘Abdullah b. Sahl went towards Khaibar and they separated near the palm-trees.  ‘Abdullah b. Sahl was killed. They accused the Jews (for this act).

Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:  Show regard for the greatness of the old, or he said: Let the eldest begin speaking.

Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) said: Let fifty (persons) among you take oath for levelling the charge (of  murder) against a person amongst them, and he would be surrendered to you. They  said: We have not witnessed this matter ourselves. How can we then take oath? He (the         Holy Prophet) said: The Jews will exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them.  They said: Messenger of Allah, they are non-believing people. Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) paid the blood wit for him. Sahl said: As one day I  entered the fold a she-camel amongst those camels hit me with its leg.  MURDERS, FIGHTING, REQUITAL

31|5962|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Abdullah b. Ja’far (Allah be pleased with him).  Abdullah b. Ja’far reported that when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be, upon him)  came back from a journey, the children of his family used to accord him welcome. It was  in this way that once he came back from a journey and I went to him first of all. He  mounted me before him. Then there came one of the two sons of Fatima and he  mounted him behind him and this is how we three entered Medina riding on a beast.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

5|2343|  Chapter: The posterity of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) is not allowed to make  use of Sadaqa.  Out of so many ahadith which Hammam b. Munabbih narrated on the authority of Abu  Huraira from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) one is this that the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I go back to my family and I find a  date lying on my bed or in my house, and I take it up to eat it, but then I throw it away  fearing that it may be a Sadaqa or from Sadaqa.

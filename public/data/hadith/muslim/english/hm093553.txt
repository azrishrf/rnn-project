9|3553|  Chapter: Li’an (Invoking curse).  Sahl b. Sa’d al-Sa’idi reported that ‘Uwaimir al-‘Ajlani came to ‘Asim b. ‘Adi al-Ansari  and said to him. Tell me about a person who finds a man with his wife; should he kill  him, and be killed In retaliation; or how should he act? ‘Asim, ask for me (religious  verdict about it) from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). So ‘Asim asked  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he did not like this question and he  disapproved of it so much that ‘Asim felt aggrieved at what he had heard from Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him). When ‘Asim came back to his family, ‘Uwaimir  came to him and said: ‘Asim, what did Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say  to you? ‘Asim said to ‘Uwaimir: You did not bring something good. Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) did not like this religious verdict that I sought from him.  ‘Uwaimir said: By Allah, I will not rest until I have asked him about it. ‘Uwaimir  proceeded until he came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he was  sitting amidst people, and said: Messenger of Allah, tell me about a person who found a  man with his wife. Should he kill him, and then you would kill him, or how should he act?  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: (Verses) have been  revealed concerning you and your wife; so go and bring her. Sahl said that they both         invoked curses (and further said): I was along with people in the company of Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him). And when they had finished, Uwaimir said:  Allah’s Messenger, I shall have told a lie against her if I keep her (now). So he divorced  her with three pronouncements before Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had  commanded him. Ibn Shihab said: Subsequently that was the practice of invokers of  curses (al Mutala’inain)

28|5602|  Chapter: Not known.  ‘Amr b. Sharid reported his father as saying: One day when I rode behind Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him), he said (to me): Do you remember any Poetry of  Umayya b. Abu Salt. I said: Yes. He said: Then go on. I recited a couplet, and he said:  Go on. Then I again recited a couplet and he said: Go on. I recited one hundred  couplets (of his poetry). This hadith has been reported on the authority of Sharid  through another chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.

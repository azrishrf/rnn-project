3|714|  Chapter: Tayammum.  ‘Aisha reported: We went with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) on one of  his journeys and when we reached the place Baida’ or Dhat al-jaish, my necklace was  broken (and fell somewhere). The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) along  with other people stayed there for searching it. There was neither any water at that  place nor was there any water with them (the Companions of the Holy Prophet). Some  persons came to my father Abu Bakr and said: Do you see what ‘Aisha has done? She  has detained the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and persons  accompanying him, and there is neither any water here or with them. So Abu Bakr came  there and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was sleeping with his head  on my thigh. He (Abu Bakr) said: You have detained the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) and other persons and there is neither water here nor with them.  She (‘Aisha) said: Abu Bakr scolded me and uttered what Allah wanted him to utter and  nudged my hips with his hand. And there was nothing to prevent me from stirring but for  the fact that the messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was lying upon my thigh.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) slept till it was dawn at a waterless  place. So Allah revealed the verses pertaining to tayammum and they (the Holy Prophet         and his Companions) performed tayammum. Usaid b. al-Hudair who was one of the  leaders said: This is not the first of your blessings, O Family to Abu Bakr. ‘Aisha said:  We made the case) stand which was my mount and found the necklace under it.

4|1607|  Chapter: Permissibility of observing Nafl (voluntary prayer) standing or sitting and observing  some part of it standing or sitting.  Abu Salama b.

She said: The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not observe either in Ramadan or in         other months more than eleven rak’ahs (of the night prayer). He (in the first instance)  observed four rak’ahs. Ask not about their excellence and their length (i.e. these were  matchless in perfection and length).

He said: O ‘Aisha, my eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.

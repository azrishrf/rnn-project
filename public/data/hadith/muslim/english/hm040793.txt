4|793|  Chapter: The placing of the right hand over the left hand after the first Takbir in prayer (Takbir-i- Tahrima) below the chest and above the navel and then placing them opposite the shoulders in  prostration.         ‘Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) said: While observing prayer behind the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) we used to recite: Peace be upon Allah, peace be upon so and so.  One day the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to us: Verily Allah is  Himself Peace. When any one of you sits during the prayer, he should say: All services  rendered by words, by acts of worship, and all good things are due to Allah. Peace be  upon you, O Prophet, and Allah’s mercy and blessings. Peace be upon us and upon  Allah’s upright servants, for when he says this it reaches every upright servant in  heaven and earth (and say further): I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify  that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. Then he may choose any supplication  which pleases him and offer it.

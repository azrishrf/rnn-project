22|4873|  Chapter: It is not permissible for one who intends to sacrifice the animal to get one’s  hair or nails cut after the beginning of Dhull-Hijja.  Umm Salama, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), reported Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) to have said: He who has a sacrificial animal with  him whom (he intends) to offer as sacrifice, and he enters the month of Dhu’I-Hijja, he  should not get his hair cut or nails trimmed until he has sacrificed the animal.

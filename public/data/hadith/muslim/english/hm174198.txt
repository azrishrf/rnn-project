17|4198|  Chapter: He who confesses his guilt of adultery.  Jabir b. Samura reported: As he was being brought to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) I saw Ma’iz b. Malik a short-statured person with strong sinews, having no  cloak around him. He bore witness against his own self four times that he had  committed adultery, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:  Perhaps (you kissed her or embraced her). He said: No. by God, one deviating (from  the path of virtue) has committed adultery. He then got him stoned (to death), and then  delivered the address: Behold, as we set out for Jihad in the cause of Allah, one of you  lagged behind and shrieked like the bleating of a male goat, and gave a small quantity  of milk. By Allah, in case I get hold of him, I shall certainly punish him.

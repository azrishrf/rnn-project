5|2353|  Chapter: Accepting of gift by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and refusing the  Sadaqa.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) said: Three are the decisions (of the Shari’ah that we  have come to know) through Barira. The people gave her sadaqa and she offered us as  gift. We made a mention of it to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him),  whereupon he said: It is a sadaqa for her and a gift for you; so eat it.

4|1782|  Chapter: Excellence of one who acts upon (the teachings of the) Qur’an and one who  teaches it.  ‘Umar b. Khattab said: I heard Hisham b. Hakim b. Hizam reciting Surah al-Furqan in a  style different from that in which I used to recite it, and in which Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) had taught me to recite it. I was about to dispute with him (on this  style) but I delayed till he had finished that (the recitation). Then I caught hold of his  cloak and brought him to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said:  Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Surah al-Furqan in a style different from  the one in which you taught me to recite. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) told (me) to leave him alone and asked him to recite. He then recited in  the style in which I beard him recite it. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) then said: Thus was it sent down. He then told me to recite and I recited it, and he  said: Thus was it sent down. The Qur’an was sent down in seven dialects. So recite  what seems easy there-from.

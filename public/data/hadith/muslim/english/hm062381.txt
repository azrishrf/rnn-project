6|2381|  Chapter: Fasting in Ramadan should necessarily be commenced with the sight of the new  moon and finished with the sight of the new moon. If the weather is cloudy at the beginning or at  the end, then complete thirty days.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace he upon him) made a mention of the new moon and (in this connection) said:  Observe fast when you see it (the new moon) and breakfast when you see it (the new  moon of Shawwal), but when (the actual position of the month is) concealed from you  (on account of cloudy sky), then count thirty days.

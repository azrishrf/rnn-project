31|5900|  Chapter: The excellent qualities of ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Abu Huraira reported that Umar b. Khattab came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) while there were some women with him and they were raising their voices  above the voice of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and when Umar sought  permission to get into the house they went behind the curtain hurriedly. The rest of the  hadith is the same.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

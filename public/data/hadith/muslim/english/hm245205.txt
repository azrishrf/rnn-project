24|5205|  Chapter: It is forbidden to walk with pride, over pleased with fine clothes.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There  was a person who walked with pride because of his (fine) mantles and well pleased with  his personality. Allah made him sink in the earth and he would go on sinking in that until  the Day of Resurrection.

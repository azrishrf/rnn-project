8|3448|  Chapter: How long after marrying one should stay with a virgin or a woman previously married.  Anas b. Malik reported: When anyone who has already a wife marries virgin, he should  stay with her for seven nights (and then turn to his other wife), but when anyone having  a virgin with him (as his wife) marries a woman who has been previously married he  should stay with her for three nights. Khalid (one of the narrators) said. If I were to say  that it could be directly traced to the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him). I would  have told the truth, but he (Hadrat Anas) said: Such is the tradition.

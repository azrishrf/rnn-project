7|3147|  Chapter: It is permissible to enter Mecca without Ihram.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) entered on the  day of Victory of Mecca wearing a black turban on his head. and she said: In case Allah  cures me I will certainly go and observe prayer in Bait al-Maqdis. She recovered and so  she made preparations to go out (to that place). She came to Maimuna, the wife of  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and after greeting her she informed her about  it, whereupon she said: Stay here and eat the provision (which you had made) and  observe prayer In the mosque of the Messenger (may peace be upon him), for I heard  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say: Prayer in it is better than a thousand  prayers observed in other mosques except the mosque of the Ka’ba.

7|3163|  Chapter: Eminence of Medina, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) showered  blessings upon it. Its sacredness and unlawfulness of hunting and lopping of trees and  demarcation its precincts.  Ibrahim al-Taimi reported on the authority of his father: ‘Ali b. Abi Talib (Allah be  pleased with him) addressed us and said: He who thought that we have besides the  Holy Qur’an anything else that we recite, he told a lie. And this document which is  hanging by the sheath of the sword contains but the ages of the camels, and the nature  of the wounds. He (Hadrat ‘Ali) reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as  saying: Medina is sacred from ‘Air to Thaur’; So if anyone makes an innovation or  accommodates an innovator, the curse of Allah, the angels, and all persons will fall  upon him, and Allah will not accept any obligatory or supererogatory act as recompense  from them. And the protection granted by the Muslims is one and must be respected by  the humblest of them. If anyone makes a false claim to paternity, or being a client of  other than his own masters, there is upon him the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the  people. Allah will not accept from him any recompense in the form of obligatory acts or  supererogatory acts. The Hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Bakr and Zabair  ends with (these words): The humblest among them should respect it; and what follows         after it is not mentioned there, and in the Hadith transmitted by them (these words are)  not found: (The document was hanging) on the sheath of his sword.

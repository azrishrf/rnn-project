4|809|  Chapter: Blessing on the Prophet (may peace be upon him) after Tashahhud.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When  the Imam says: “Allah listens to him who praises Him.” you should say: “O Allah, our         Lord for Thee is the praise.” for if what anyone says synchronises with what the angels  say, his past sins will be forgiven.

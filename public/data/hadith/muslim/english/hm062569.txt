6|2569|  Chapter: Excellence of fasting.  Sahl b. Sa’d (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: In Paradise there is a gate which is called Rayyan through which  only the observers of fast would enter on the Day on Resurrection. None else would  enter along with them. It would be proclaimed: Where are the observers of fast that they  should be admitted into it?-and when the last of them would enter, it would be closed  and no one would enter it.

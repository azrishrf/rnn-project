30|5733|  Chapter: The mercy-and tenderness shown by Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  towards children, members of his family. and his humility and his sublime qualities.  Anas b. Malik reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: A child  was born into me this night and I named him after the name of my father Ibrihim. He  then sent him to Umm Saif, the wife of a blacksmith who was called Abu Saif. He (the  Holy Prophet) went to him and I followed him until we reached Abu Saif and he was  blowing fire with the help of blacksmith’s bellows and the house was filled with smoke. I  hastened my step and went ahead of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and  said: Abu Saif, stop it, as there comes Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon him). He  stopped and Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) called for the child. He embraced  him and said what Allah had desired. Anas said: I saw that the boy breathed his last in  the presence of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). The eyes of Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) shed tears and he said: Ibrahim, our eyes shed  tears and our hearts are filled with grief, but we do not say anything except that by  which Allah is pleased. O Ibrahim, we are grieved for you.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

22|4841|  Chapter: It is meritorious to sacrifice the animal with one’s own hand and so is  meritorious the recitation of Bismillah (in the name of Allah) and Takbir (Allah o-Akbar).  Anas reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sacrificed with his own  hands two horned rams which were white with black markings reciting the name of Allah  and glorifying Him (saying Allah-o-Akbar). He placed his foot on their sides (while  sacrificing).

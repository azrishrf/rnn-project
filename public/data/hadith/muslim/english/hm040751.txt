4|751|  Chapter: He who hears the Adhin should respond like it, invoke blessings upon the Apostle  (may peace be upon him)and then beg for him the Wasila.  Abu Sufyan reported it on the authority of Jabir that he had heard the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him) say: When Satan hears the call to prayer, he runs away to a  distance like that of Rauha. Sulaiman said: I asked him about Rauha. He replied: It is at  a distance of thirty-six miles from Medina.

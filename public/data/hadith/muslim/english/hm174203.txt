17|4203|  Chapter: He who confesses his guilt of adultery.  Dawud narrated the hadith with the same chain of transmitters (and the words are):  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) stood tip (to address the audience) in the  evening and praised Allah, glorified Him and then said: What about the people, that as  we set out on an expedition, one of you remained behind us and he shrieked like the  bleating of a male goat? But he did not mention (these words):People connected with  us.”

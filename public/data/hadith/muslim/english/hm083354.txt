8|3354|  Chapter: It is not permissible to marry a woman, who is divorced by three pronouncements until  she is married to another, man and he has a sexual intercourse with her, and then he abandons  her and she completes her ‘Idda.  ‘Aisha (Allah he pleased with her) reported: There came the wife of Rifa’a to Allah’s  Apostle (May peace be upon him) and said: I was married to Rifa’a but he divorced me,  making may divorce irrevocable. Afterwards I married Abd al-Rahman b. al-Zubair, but  all he possesses is like the fringe of a garment (i.e. he is sexually weak). Thereupon  Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) smiled, and said: Do you wish to return to  Rifa’a.

Sa’id) was at the door waiting for the permission to be granted  to him to enter), He (Khalid) said; Abu Bakr, do you hear what she is saying loudly in the  presence of Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him)?

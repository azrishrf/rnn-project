10|3704|  Chapter: Pertaining to one who sells date-palm tree with dates hanging on Its  branches.  Abdullah b. Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) as saying: He who buys a tree after it has been fecundated, its fruit  belongs to one who sells it except when the provision has been laid down by the buyer  (that it will belong to him), and he who buys a slave, his property belongs to one who  sells him except when a provision has been laid down by the buyer (that it will be  transferred to him with the slave).

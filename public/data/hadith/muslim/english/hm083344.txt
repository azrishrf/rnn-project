8|3344|  Chapter: When one is invited to a wedding feast, one should accept it.  Nafil reported: I heard Abdullah b. Umar (Allah be pleased with them) narrating that  Allahâ€™s Messenger (May peace be upon him) said: Accept the feast when you are  invited to it. And Abdullah (b. Umar) used to come to the feast, whether it was a  wedding feast or other than that, and he would come there even in the state of fasting.

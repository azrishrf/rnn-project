39|6747|  Chapter: The believer is likened to the date-palm tree.  ‘Abdullah b. Umar reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:  There is a tree amongst trees, the leaves of which do not wither and that is like a         Muslim; tell me which that (tree) can be? The people began to think of the trees of the  forest. Abdullah said: I thought that it could be the date-palm tree, but I felt hesitant (to  say that). They (the Companions) then said: Allah’s Messenger, (kindly) tell us which  that can be? Thereupon he said: It is the date-palm tree. I made a mention of that to  ‘Umar, whereupon he said: Had you said that it meant the date-palm tree, this  statement of yours (would have been dearer to me) than such and such things.

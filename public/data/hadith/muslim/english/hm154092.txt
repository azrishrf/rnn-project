15|4092|  Chapter: Feeding of slave with what the master cats himself and clothing him with what  he wears himself and not to burden him beyond capacity.  Al-Ma’rur b. Suwaid said: We went to Abu Dharr (Ghifari) in Rabadha and he had a  mantle over him, and his slave had one like it. We said: Abu Dharr, had you joined them  together, it would have been a complete garment. Thereupon he said: There was an  altercation between me and one of the persons among my brothers. His mother was a  non-Arab. I reproached him for his mother. He complained against me to Allah’s Apostle  (may peace be upon him). As I met Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) he said:  Abu Dharr, you are a person who still has (in him the remnants) of the days (of  Ignorance). Thereupon I said: Allah’s Messenger, he who abuses (other) persons, they  abuse (in return) his father and mother. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Abu Dharr, you are  a person who still has (the remnants) of Ignorance in him They (your servants and  slaves) are your brothers. Allah has put them in your care, so feed them with what you  eat, clothe them with what you wear and do not burden them beyond their capacities;  but if you burden them (with an unbearable burden), then help them (by sharing their  extra burden).

7|2672|  Chapter: The people of Medina are commanded to enter upon the state of ihram at a  mosque in Dhu’l Hulaifa.  Salim b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he heard his father saying:  This place Baida’ is for you that about which you attribute lie to the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him). And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did  not enter upon the state of Ihram but near the mosque at Dhu’l-Hulaifa.

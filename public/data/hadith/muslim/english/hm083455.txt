8|3455|  Chapter: Permissibility of bestowing the turn on one’s fellow-wife.  ‘Ata related that when they were with Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) at the  funeral of Maimuna In Sarif, Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) said: This is the  wife of Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him); so when you lift her bier, do not shake  her or disturb her, but be gentle, for Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) had  nine wives, with eight of whom he shared his time, but to one of them, he did not allot a  share. ‘Ati said: The one to whom he did not allot a share of time was Safiyya, daughter  of Huyayy b. Akhtab.

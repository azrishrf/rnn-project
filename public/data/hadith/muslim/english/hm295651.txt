29|5651|  Chapter: The vision of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: While I  was sleeping, the treasures of the earth were presented to me and I was made to wear  in my hands two gold bangles. I felt a sort of burden upon me and I was disturbed and it  was suggested to me that I should blow over them, so I blew and both of them  disappeared. I interpreted them as two great liars who would appear at any time, one is  the inhabitant of Sana’ and the other is that of Yamama.

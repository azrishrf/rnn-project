30|5845|  Chapter: The merits of Ibrahim. the Friend of Allah (peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: We have  more claim to doubt than Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when he said, My Lord, show me  how thou wilt quicken the dead. He said: Believeth thou not? He said: Yes, but that my  heart rest at ease (the Holy Qur’an. 260). May Lord have mercy on Lot that he wanted a  strong support and had I stayed in the prison as long as Yusuf stayed I would have  responded to him who invited me.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

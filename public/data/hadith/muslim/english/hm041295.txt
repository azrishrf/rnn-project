4|1295|  Chapter: Desirability of saying the noon prayer when the extreme heat is over.  Khabbab reported: We came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and  we complained to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) about (saying  prayer) on the extremely heated ground (or sand), but he paid no heed to us. Zuhair  said: I asked Abu Ishaq whether it was about the noon prayer. He said: Yes. I again  said whether it concerned the (offering) of the noon (prayer) in earlier hours. He said:  Yes. I said: Did it concern expediting it? He said: Yes.

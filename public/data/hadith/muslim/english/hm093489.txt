9|3489|  Chapter: It is forbidden to divorce the woman during her menses.  Abu Zubair reported that he heard ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Aiman (the freed slave of ‘Azza)  say that he asked Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) and Abu Zubair heard: What  is your opinion about the person who divorced his wife in the state of menses?  Thereupon he said: Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) divorced his wife during the  lifetime of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) while she was in the state of  menses. Upon this Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) told him to take her  back and so he took her back and he (further) said: When she is pure, then either  divorce her or retain her. Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) said that Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) then recited this verse: “O Apostle, when you divorce  women, divorce them at the commencement of their prescribed period” (ixv 1).

31|5893|  Chapter: The excellent qualities of ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: While I  was asleep I saw myself drawing water from my tank in order to quench the thirst of the  people that there came to me Abu Bakr. He took hold of the leathern bucket from my  hand so that he should serve water to the people. He drew two bucketfuls and there  was some weakness in his drawing (Allah may forgive him). Then there came Ibn  Khattab and he took hold of that, and I did not see a person stronger than he (drawing  water) until the people went away with their thirst quenched and the tank filled with  water.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

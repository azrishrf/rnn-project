41|7025|  Chapter: The appearance of the Dajjal and his stay upon the earth and the descent of Jesus  and his killing him (Dajjal) and the departure of good people of strong conviction and the         survival of the wicked people and the worship of idols and the blowing of the trumpet and the  raising up from the graves.  Abdullah b. ‘Amr reported: I committed to memory a hadith from Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) and I did not forget it after I had heard Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) as saying: The first sign (nut of the signs of the appearance of  the Dajjal) would be the appearance of the sun from the west, the appearance of the  beast before the people in the forenoon and which of the two happens first, the second  one would follow immediately after that.

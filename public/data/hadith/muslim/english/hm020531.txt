2|531|  Chapter: Wiping (over) the forelock and turban.  ‘Urwa b. al Mughira b. Shu’ba reported it on the authority of his father that he said: The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) lagged behind (in a journey) and I also  lagged behind along with him. After having relieved himself he said: Have you any water  with you? I brought to him a jar of water; he washed his palms, and face, and when he  tried to get his forearms out (he could not) for the sleeve of the gown was tight. He,  therefore, brought them out from under the gown and, throwing it over his shoulders, he  washed his forearm. He then wiped his forelock and his turban and his socks. He then  mounted and I also mounted (the ride) and came to the people. They had begun the  prayer with ‘Abd ar-Rabmin b. ‘Anf leading them and had completed a rak’ah. When he  perceived the presence of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) he began to  retire. He (the Holy Prophet) signed to him to continue and offered prayer along with  them. Then when he had pronounced the salutation, the Apostle (may peace be upon  him) got up and I also got up with him, and we offered the rak’ah which had been  finished before we came.

4|1768|  Chapter: Excellence of sura Fatiha and concluding verses of surat al-Baqara and  exhortation to recite the last two verses of surat al-Baqara.  Ubayy b. Ka’b said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Abu’ al- Mundhir, do you know the verse from the Book of Allah which, according to you, is the  greatest? I said: Allah and His Apostle (may peace be upon him) know best. He again  said: Abu’l-Mundhir, do you know the verse from the Book of Allah which, according to  you, is the greatest? I said: Allah, there is no god but He, the Living, the Eternal.  Thereupon he struck me on my breast and said: May knowledge be pleasant for you, O  Abu’l-Mundhir!

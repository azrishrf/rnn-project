31|6015|  Chapter: The merits of Bilal (Allah be pleased with him).  Abu Huraira reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Bilal:  Bilal, narrate to me which act at the time of morning prayer you did in Islam for which  you hope to receive good reward, for I heard during the night the sound of your steps         before me in Paradise. Bilal said: I did not do any act in Islam for which I hope to get  any benefit but this that when I perform complete ablution during the night or day I  observe prayer with that purification what Allah has ordained for me to pray.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

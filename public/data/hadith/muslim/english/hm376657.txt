37|6657|  Chapter: The words of Allah “The good deeds take away the evil deeds”.         This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sulaiman Taimi with the same chain of  transmitters that a person had taken liberty with a woman less than fornication. He  came to ‘Umar b. Khattab and he took it to be a serious offence. Then he came to Abu  Bakr and he also took it to be a serious offence. Then he came the Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) and he made a mention of this to him. The rest of the hadith is the  same.

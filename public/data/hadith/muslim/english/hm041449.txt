4|1449|  Chapter: The excellence of Qunut in all the prayers when any calamity befalls the Muslims.  Abu Huraira reported: We stopped for rest along with the Apostle of Allah (may peace  be upon him) and did not awake till the sun rose. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be  upon him) then told us that everybody should take hold of his camel’s nose-string (get  out of this ground) for it was the place where devil had visited us. We did accordingly.  He then called for water and performed ablution and then performed two prostrations.  Ya’qub said: Then he prayed (performed) two prostrations, then takbir was pronounced  for prayer and then he offered the morning prayer (in congregation).

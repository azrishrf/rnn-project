8|3359|  Chapter: It is not permissible to marry a woman, who is divorced by three pronouncements until  she is married to another, man and he has a sexual intercourse with her, and then he abandons  her and she completes her ‘Idda.  ‘A’Asha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: A person divorced his wife by three  pronouncements; then another person married her and he also divorced her without  having sexual intercourse with her. Then the first husband of her intended to remarry  her. It was about such a case that Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) was  asked, whereupon he said: No, until the second one has tasted her sweetness as the  first one had tasted.

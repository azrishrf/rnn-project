15|4069|  Chapter: Expressing the words “God willing” in the oath.  Abu Huraira reported that Sulaiman b. Dawud said: I will certainly have intercourse with  seventy wives during the night, and every wife amongst them will give birth to a child,  who will fight in the cause of Allah. It was said to him: Say: “Insha’ Allah” (God willing),  but he did not say so and forgot it. He went round them but none of them give birth to a  child except one woman and that too was an incomplete person. Upon this Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If he had said “Insha’ Allah.” he would not  have failed, and his desire must have been fulfilled.

20|4565|  Chapter: Decision about one who tries to disrupt the unity of the Muslims.  It has been narrated on the authority of â€˜Arfaja who said: I have heard the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) say: Different evils will make their appearance in the  near future. Anyone who tries to disrupt the affairs of this Umma while they are united  you should strike him with the sword whoever he be. (If remonstrance does not prevail  with him and he does not desist from his disruptive activities, he is to be killed.)

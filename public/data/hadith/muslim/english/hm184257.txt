18|4257|  Chapter: It is forbidden to ask many questions, and wasting of wealth.  Mughira b. Shu’ba reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  Verity Allah, the Glorious and Majestic, has forbidden for you: disobedience to mothers,  and burying alive daughters, withholding the right of others in spite of having the power  to return that to them and demanding that (which is not one’s legitimate right). And He  disapproved three things for you; irrelevant talk, persistent questioning and wasting of  wealth.

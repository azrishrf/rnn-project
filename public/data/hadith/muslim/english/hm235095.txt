23|5095|  Chapter: The merit of vinegar as a condiment.  This hadith is reported on the authority of Jabir b. ‘Abdullah that Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) took hold of his hand and led him to his residence as narrated  above up to the words: “Vinegar is a good condiment.” But in the hadith transmitted  through this chain of transmitters, there is no mention of the subsequent part.

24|5258|  Chapter: Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.  ‘Aisha reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) entered (my  apartment) and I had hung (on the door of my apartment) a thin curtain having pictures  on it. The colour of his face underwent a change. He then took hold of that curtain and  tore it and then said: The most grievous torment for the people on the Day of  Resurrection would be for those who try to imitate Allah in the act of creation.

Munabbih reported: This is what Abu Huraira transmitted to us from  Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and he narrated (some)  ahadith out of (these narrations and one of them is this): The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: When any one of you stands to lead people In prayer, he  should shorten it, for amongst them are the aged, and amongst them are the weak, but  when he prays by himself, he may prolong his prayer as he likes.

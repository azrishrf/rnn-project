3|656|  Chapter: The woman who has a prolonged flow of blood, her bathing and prayer.  This Hadith has been thus reported by another chain of transmitters: Umm Habiba b.  Jahsh came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and she had been a  mustahada for seven years, and the rest of the Hadith was narrated like that of ‘Amr b.  al-Harith up to the words: “There came the redness of the blood over water.” and  nothing was narrated beyond it.

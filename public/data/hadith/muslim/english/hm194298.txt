Abu Burda through his father through his  grandfather that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent him and Mu’adh  (on a mission) to the Yemen, and said (by way of advising them): Show leniency (to the  people); don’t be hard upon them; give them glad tidings (of Divine favours in this world  and the Hereafter); and do not create aversion. Work in collaboration and don’t be  divided.

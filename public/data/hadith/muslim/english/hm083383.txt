8|3383|  Chapter: Al-Azl (incomplete sexual intercourse): Coitus Interruptus.  Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man came to Allah’s Messenger (May  peace be upon him) and said: I have a slave-girl who is our servant and she carries  water for us and I have intercourse with her, but I do not want her to conceive. He said:  Practise ‘azl, if you so like, but what is decreed for her will come to her. The person  stayed back (for some time) and then came and said: The girl has become pregnant,  whereupon he said: I told you what was decreed for her would come to her.

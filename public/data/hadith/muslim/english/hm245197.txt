24|5197|  Chapter: It to forbidden to trail one’s garment out of conceit or pride.  Muslim b. Yannaq reported that Ibn Umar saw a person trailing his lower garment,  whereupon he said: From whom do you come? He described his relationship (with the  tribe he belonged) and it was found that he belonged to the tribe of Laith. Ibn Umar  recognised him and said: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with  these two ears of mine saying: He who trailed his lower garment with no other intention  but pride, Allah would not look toward him on the Day of Resurrection.

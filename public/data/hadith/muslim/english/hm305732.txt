30|5732|  Chapter: It is very seldom that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said ‘No” to anyone  when asked to give anything, and he gave charity to the people very freely.         Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: When Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) died, there  came to Abfi Bakr wealth from al-‘Ala’ b. al-Hadrami. Abu Bakr said: He to whom Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) owed any debt or held out any promise should come  to us; the rest of the hadith is the same.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

22|4869|  Chapter: It is not permissible for one who intends to sacrifice the animal to get one’s  hair or nails cut after the beginning of Dhull-Hijja.  Umm Salama reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said this:  When any one of you intending to sacrifice the animal enters in the month (of Dhu’l- Hijja) he should not get his hair or nails touched (cut). It was said to Sufyan that some of  the (scholars) did not deem this hadith to be Maffu’. He said: But I deem it as Marfu’ (i.e.  chain of narration traceable right up to the Holy Prophet).

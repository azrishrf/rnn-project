20|4723|  Chapter: Keeping the good of the animals in view during a journey and forbiddance  from halting for the night on the track.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: When you journey through a fertile land, you should (go slow  and) give the camels a chance to graze in the land. When you travel In an arid (land)  where there is scarcity of vegetation, you should quicken their pace (lest your camels  grow feeble and emaciated for lack of fodder). When you halt for the night, avoid  (pitching your tent on) the road, for it is the abode of noxious little animals at night.

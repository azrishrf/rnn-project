24|5134|  Chapter: The use of gold and silver vessels to forbidden to men and women and it is  also prohibited to drink in them.  ‘Abdullah b. Ukaim reported: While we were with Hudhaifa in Mada’in he asked for  water. A villager brought a drink for him in a silver vessel. He (Hudhaifa) threw it away  saying: I inform you that I have already conveyed to him that he should not serve me  drink in it (silver vessel) for Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said: Do  not drink in gold and silver vessels, and do not wear brocade or silk, for these are meant  for them (the non-believers) in this world, but they are meant for you in the Hereafter on  the Day, of Resurrection.

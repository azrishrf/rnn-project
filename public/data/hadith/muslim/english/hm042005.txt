4|2005|  Chapter: Closing the (eyes) of the dead and supplication for him on visiting him.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Did you  not see when the man died and his eyes were fixedly open? He (Abu Huraira) said:  Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) said: It is due to the fact that when (the soul leaves the  body) his eyesight follows the soul.

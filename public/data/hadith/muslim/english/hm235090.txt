23|5090|  Chapter: The merit of the fruit of Arak tree.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported: We were with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  at Marr az-Zahran, and we were plucking the fruit of the Arak tree, whereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: Pluck only its black ones (for they are the  most pleasant). We said: Allah’s Messenger, it seems you shepherded the flock. He  said: Yes. Has there been a prophet who did not shepherd it (or some words like it)?

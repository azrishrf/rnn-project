41|7020|  Chapter: The Dajjak would be very insignificant in the eye of Allah, the Majestic and Glorious.         Mughira b. Shu’ba reported: No one asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  more about Dajjil than I asked him. He said: He should not be a source of worry to you  for he would not be able to do any harm to you. I said: Allah’s Messenger, it is alleged  that he would have along with him (abundance of) food and water. Thereupon he said:  He would be very insignificant in the eye of Allah (even) with all this.

24|5293|  Chapter: Prohibition of sitting on the roadsides and to honour the obligations of the  roadside.  Abu Sa’id Kbudri reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: Avoid  sitting on the paths. They (his Companions) said: Allah’s Messenger, there is no other  help to it (but to sit here as we) hold our meetings and discuss matters there.  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If you have to sit at all,  then fulfil the rights, of the path. They said: What are their rights? Thereupon he said:  Keeping the eye downward (so that you may not stare at the women), refraining from  doing some harm to the other and exchanging mutual greetings (saying as-Salamu  ‘Alaikum to one another) and commanding the good and forbidding the evil.

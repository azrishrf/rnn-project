4|1935|  Chapter: Abandoning of prayer before Id and after it in the place of worship (outside the  habitation) especially meant for Id.  Ibn ‘Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) went out on  the day of Adha or Fitr and observed two rak’ahs, and did not observe prayer (at that  place) before and after that. He then came to the women along with Bilal and  commanded them to give alms and the women began to give their rings and necklaces.  This Hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu’ba with the same chain of  transmitters.

33|6409|  Chapter: The excellence of arguments between Adam and Moses (Allah be pleased with both  of them).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying: There  was argument between Adam and Moses. Moses said to Adam: You are our father. You  did us harm and caused us to get out of Paradise. Adam said to him: You are Moses.  Allah selected you (for direct conversation with you) and wrote with His own Hand the  Book (Torah) for you. Despite this you blame me for an act which Allah had ordained for  me forty years before He created me. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said:  This is how Adam came the better of Moses and Adam came the better of Moses.

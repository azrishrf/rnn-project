4|1038|  Chapter: The excellence of the prayer and the way it is begun and the excellence of  Ruku’ and moderation in it and prostration and moderation in it, etc.  Masruq reported: It was mentioned before ‘Aisha that prayer is invalidated (in case of  passing) of a dog, an ass and a woman (before the worshipper, when he is not  screened). Upon this ‘Aisha said: You likened us to the asses and the dogs. By Allah I  saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saying prayer while I lay on the  bedstead interposing between him and the Qibla. When I felt the need, I did not like to  wit to front (of the Holy Prophet) and perturb the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) and quietly moved out from under its (i.e. of the bedstead) legs.

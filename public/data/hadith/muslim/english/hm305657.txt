30|5657|  Chapter: The miracles of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).     Anas b. Malik reported: I saw Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) during the time of the  afternoon prayer and the people asking for water for performing ablution which they did not find.  (A small quantity) of water was brought to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he  placed his hand in that vessel and commanded people to perform ablution. I saw water spouting  from his fingers and the people performing ablution until the last amongst them performed it.     (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

7|2714|  Chapter: Hunting is forbidden for one who is in the state of Ihram.  ‘Abdullah b. Abu Qatada reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with  him) that they went out with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and they  were Muhrim except Abu Qatada. The rest of the Hadith Is the same (but with the  exception of these words): “He (the Holy Prophet) said: 15 there anything out of it? They  said: We have its leg with us. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took it  and ate it.”

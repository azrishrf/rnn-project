5|2234|  Chapter: Concerning the collection of Sadaqa and doing of good deeds.  ‘Aisha reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When a woman  spends (something as Sadaqa) out of the household of her husband without causing         any damage, there is a reward for her and for him too like it for whatever he earned, and  for her (for the wife) because of her spending (for the sake of Allah), and for the trustee  also (there is a reward like it), without any reduction from their rewards.

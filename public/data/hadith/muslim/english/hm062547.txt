6|2547|  Chapter: Abrogation of the words of Allah: “And as for those who can fast (but do not) the  expiation is” by the words: “Whosoever witnesses it he shall have to fast the whole month” (ii.  184).  Salama b. Akwa’ (Allah be pleased with him) reported that when this verse was  revealed: “And as for those who can fast (but do not) expiation is the feeding of a needy  person” (ii. 183), (he who liked to observe fast did observe it) and he who felt reluctant  to observe it ate and expiated till the verse was revealed which abrogated it.

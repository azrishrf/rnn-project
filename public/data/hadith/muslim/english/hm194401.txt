19|4401|  Chapter: The treaty of Hudaibiya.  It has been narrated on the authority of al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib who said: ‘Ali b. Abu Talib  penned the treaty between the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and the  polytheists on the Day of Hudaibiya. He wrote: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger  of Allah, has settled. They (the polytheists) said: Do not write words “the Messenger of  Allah”. If we knew that you were the Messenger of Allah, we would not fight against you.  The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said to ‘Ali: Strike out these words. He (Ali) said:  I am not going to strike them out. So the Prophet (may peace be upon him) struck them  out with his own hand. The narrator said that the conditions upon which the two sides  had agreed included that the Muslims would enter Mecca (next year) and would stay  there for three days, and that they would not enter bearing arms except in their sheaths  or bolsters.

6|2398|  Chapter: The timing of fast begins with the dawn.  Sahl b. Sa’d (Allah be pleased with him) said: When this verse was revealed. “Eat and  drink till the white streak becomes distinct from the dark streak for you,” the person who  decided to observe fast tied on one of his feet a black thread and on the other a white  thread. And he went on eating and drinking till he could distinguish (between their  colour) on seeing them. It was after this that Allah revealed (the words): min al-fajr. And  they (the Muslims) came to know that (the word khait) refers to the night and day.

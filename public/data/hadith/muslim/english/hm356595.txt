35|6595|  Chapter: Supplication is granted if the supplicant does not show impatience.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The  supplication of the servant is granted in case he does not supplicate for sin or for  severing the ties of blood, or he does not become impatient. It was said: Allah’s  Messenger, what does: “If he does not grow impatient” imply? He said: That he should  say like this: I supplicated and I supplicated but I did not find it being responded and  they he becomes frustrated and abandons supplication.            Traditions

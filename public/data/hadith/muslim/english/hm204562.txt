20|4562|  Chapter: Instruction to stick to the main body of the Muslims in the time of trials and  warning against those inviting people to disbelief.         It has been reported on the authority of Nafi, that ‘Abdullah b. Umar paid a visit to  Abdullah b. Muti’ in the days (when atrocities were perpetrated on the People Of  Medina) at Harra in the time of Yazid b. Mu’awiya. Ibn Muti’ said: Place a pillow for Abu  ‘Abd al-Rahman (family name of ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar). But the latter said: I have not  come to sit with you. I have come to you to tell you a tradition I heard from the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I heard him say: One who withdraws his  band from obedience (to the Amir) will find no argument (in his defence) when he  stands before Allah on the Day of Judgment, and one who dies without having bound  himself by an oath of allegiance (to an Amir) will die the death of one belonging to the  days of Jahillyya.

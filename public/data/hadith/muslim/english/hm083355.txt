8|3355|  Chapter: It is not permissible to marry a woman, who is divorced by three pronouncements until  she is married to another, man and he has a sexual intercourse with her, and then he abandons  her and she completes her ‘Idda.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her), the wife of Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him),  reported that Rifa’a al-Quraid (Allah be pleased with him) divorced his wife, making her  divorce irrevocable. Afterwards she married Abd at-Rahman b. al-Zubair (Allah be  pleased with him), She came to Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him and said to  Allah’s messenger (May peace be upon him) that she had been the wife of Rifa’a (Allah  be pleased with him) and he had divorced her by three pronouncements and afterwards  she married ‘Abd al-Rahman b. al-Zubair. By Allah, all he possesses is like the fringe of  a garment, and she took hold of the fringe of her garment. Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (May peace be upon him) laughed and said: Perhaps you wish to return to  Rifa’a, (but you) cannot (do it) until he has tasted your sweetness and you have tasted  his sweetness. Abu Bakr al-siddiq (Allah be pleased with him) was sitting at that time  with Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) and Khalid b. Sa’id b. al-‘As (Allah be  pleased with him) was sitting at the door of his apartment and he was not permitted to  (enter the room), and Kbalid called loudly saying: Abu Bakr, why don’t you scold her for  what she is saying loudly in the presence of Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon  him)?

6|2380|  Chapter: Fasting in Ramadan should necessarily be commenced with the sight of the new  moon and finished with the sight of the new moon. If the weather is cloudy at the beginning or at  the end, then complete thirty days.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Observe  fast on sighting it (the new moon) and break it on sighting it. But if (due to clouds) the  actual position of the month is concealed from you, you should then count thirty (days).

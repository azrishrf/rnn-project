4|1184|  Chapter: It is forbidden to cry out for finding out the lost thing in the mosque.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led us in the  ‘Asr prayer and gave salutation after two rak’ahs. Dhu’l-Yadain (the possessor of long  arms) stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, has the prayer been shortened or have  you forgotten? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Nothing like this  has happened (neither the prayer has been shortened nor have I forgotten). He (Dhu’l-        Yadain) said: Messenger of Allah, something has definitely happened. The Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) turned towards people and said: Is Dhu’l-Yadain true  (in his assertion)? They said: Messenger of Allah, he is true. Then the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) completed the rest of the prayer and then performed  two prostrations while he was sitting after salutation.

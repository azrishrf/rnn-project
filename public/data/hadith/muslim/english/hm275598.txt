27|5598|  Chapter: The use of Musk and that is the best scent, and the disapproval of rejecting the gift of  scent and flower.         Abd Sa’id Khudri reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: There  was a woman from Bani Isra’il who was short-statured and she walked in the company  of two tall women with wooden sandals in her feet and a ring of gold made of plates with  musk filled in them and then looked up, and musk is the best of scents; then she walked  between two women and they (the people) did not recognise her, and she made a  gesture with her hand like this, and Shu’ba shook his hand in order to give an indication  how she shook her hand.

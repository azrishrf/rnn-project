17|4209|  Chapter: He who confesses his guilt of adultery.  Abu Huraira and Zaid b Khalid al-Juhani reported that one of the desert tribes came to  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, I beg of you  in the name of Allah that you pronounce judgment about me according to the Book of  Allah. The second claimant who was wiser than him said: Well, decide amongst us  according to the Book of Allah, but permit me (to say something). Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon ham) said: Say. He said: My son was a servant in the  house of this person and he committed adultery with his wife. I was informed that my  son deserved stoning to death (as punishment for this offence). I gave one hundred         goats and a slave girl as ransom for this. I asked the scholars (if this could serve as an  expiation for this offence). They informed me that my son deserved one hundred lathes  and exile for one year and this woman deserved stoning (as she was married).  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is  my life, I will decide between you according to the Book of Allah. The slave-girl and the  goats should be given back, and your son is to be punished with one hundred lashes  and exile for one year. And, O Unais (b. Zuhaq al-Aslami), go to this woman in the  morning, and if she makes a confession, then stone her. He (the narrator) said: He went  to her in the morning and she made a confession. And Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) made pronouncement about her and she was stoned to death.

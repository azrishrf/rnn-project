30|5768|  Chapter: Pertaining to the hair of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), his features.  Ibn Abbas reported that the People of the Book used to let their hair fall (on their  foreheads) and the polytheists used to part them on their heads, and Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) liked to conform his behaviour to the People of the Book in  matters in which he received no command (from God); so Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) let fall his hair upon his forehead, and then he began to part it after  this.

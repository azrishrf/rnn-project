8|3377|  Chapter: Al-Azl (incomplete sexual intercourse): Coitus Interruptus.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported that mention was made of ‘azl  in the presence of Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) whereupon he said: Why  do you practise it? They said: There is a man whose wife has to suckle the child, and if  that person has a sexual intercourse with her (she may conceive) which he does not  like, and there is another person who has a slave-girl and he has a sexual intercourse  with her, but he does not like her to have conception so that she may not become Umm  Walad, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: There is no harm if you do not do that,  for that (the birth of the child) is something preordained. Ibn ‘Aun said: I made a mention  of this hadith to Hasan, and he said: By Allah, (it seems) as if there is upbraiding in it  (for ‘azl).

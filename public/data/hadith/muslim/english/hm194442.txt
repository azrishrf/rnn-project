19|4442|  Chapter: The battle of Ahzab or Khandaq (the tribes or the ditch).  It has been reported on the authority of Barraâ€™ who said: The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) was carrying the earth with us on the Day of Ahzab and the  whiteness of his belly had been covered with earth, (While engaged in this toil) he was  reciting:  By God, if Thou hadst not guided us, we would have neither been guided aright nor  practised charity, nor offered prayers. Descend on us peace and tranquillity. Behold I  these people (the Meccans) refused to follow us. According to another version, he  recited:  The chieftains (of the tribes) refused to follow us when they contemplated mischief, we  rejected it. And with this (verse) he would raise his voice.

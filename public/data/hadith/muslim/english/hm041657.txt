4|1657|  Chapter: The most excellent prayer is one in which one stands for a longer time.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah  descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the first part of the night is  over and says: I am the Lord; I am the Lord: who is there to supplicate Me so that I  answer him? Who is there to beg of Me so that I grant him? Who is there to beg  forgiveness from Me so that I forgive him? He continues like this till the day breaks.

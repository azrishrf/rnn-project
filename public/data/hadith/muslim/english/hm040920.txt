4|920|  Chapter: Recitation in noon and afternoon prayers.  Qutba b. Malik reported: I said prayer and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) led it and he recited “Qaf. (I.). By the Glorious Qur’an” till he recited “and the tall  palm trees” (l. 10). I wanted to repeat it but I could not follow its significance.

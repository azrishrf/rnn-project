20|4682|  Chapter: In proof of the martyr’s attaining paradise.         It has been reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that some people came to the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said to him: Send with us some men  who may teach us the Qur’an and the Sunnah. Accordingly, he sent seventy men from  the Ansar. They were called the reciters and among them was my maternal uncle.  Haram. They used to recite the Qur’an, discuss and ponder over its meaning at night. In  the day they brought water and poured it (in pitchers) in the mosque, collected wood  and sold it, and with the sale proceeds bought food for the people of the Suffa and the  needy. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) sent the Reciters with these people,  but these (treacherous people) fell upon them and killed them before they reached their  destination (While dying), they said: O Allah, convey from us the news to our Prophet  that we have met Thee (in a way) that we are pleased with Thee and Thou art pleased  with us. (The narrator said): A man attacked Haram (maternal uncle of Anas)) from  behind and smote him with a spear which pierced him. (While dying), Haram said: By  the Lord of the Ka’ba, I have met with success. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said to his Companions: Your brethren have been slain grid they were  saying: O Allah, convey from us to our Prophet the news that we have met Thee in a  way that we are pleased with Thee and Thou art pleased with us.

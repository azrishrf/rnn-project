23|5005|  Chapter: Etiquette relating to eating and drinking.  Hudhaifa b. al-Yaman reported: When we were invited to a dinner with Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him); the rest of hadith is the same but there is a slight  variation of wording (and the variation is) that in that hadith the desert Arab precedes  the arrival of that girl, and at the conclusion there is an addition (to this effect): “He (the  Holy Prophet) then mentioned the name of Allah and ate.” This hadith is reported on the  authority of A’mash with the same chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of  wording.

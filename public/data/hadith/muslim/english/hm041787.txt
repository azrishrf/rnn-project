4|1787|  Chapter: Excellence of one who acts upon (the teachings of the) Qur’an and one who  teaches it.  Ubayy b. Ka’b reported: I was in the mosque when a man entered and prayed and  recited (the Qur’an) in a style to which I objected. Then another man entered (the  mosque) and recited in a style different from that of his companion. When we had  finished the prayer, we all went to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said  to him: This man recited in a style to which I objected, and the other entered and recited  in a style different from that of his companion. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) asked them to recite and so they recited, and the Apostle of Allah (may  peace be upon him) expressed approval of their affairs (their modes of recitation) and  there occurred In my mind a sort of denial which did not occur even during the Days of  Ignorance. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw how I was  affected (by a wrong idea), he struck my chest, whereupon I broke into sweating and felt  as though I were looking at Allah with fear. He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Ubayy, a  message was sent to me to recite the Qur’an in one dialect, and I replied: Make (things)  easy for my people. It was conveyed to me for the second time that it should be recited  in two dialects. I again replied to him: Make affairs easy for my people. It was again  conveyed to me for the third time to recite in seven dialects And (I was further told): You  have got a seeking for every reply that I sent you, which you should seek from Me. I         said: O Allah ! forgive my people, forgive my people, and I have deferred the third one  for the day on which the entire creation will turn to me, including even Ibrahim (peace be  upon him) (for intercession).

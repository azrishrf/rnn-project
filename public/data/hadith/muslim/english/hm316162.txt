31|6162|  Chapter: Meaning of the saying of the Prophet (may peace be upon him): “No person would  survive after a century who is living by this time of mine”.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as  saying this one month before his death: You asked me about the Last Hour whereas its  knowledge is with Allah. I, however, take an oath and say that none upon the earth, the  created beings (from amongst my Companions), would survive at the end of one  hundred years. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Juraij with the  same chain of transmitters, but there is no mention of the words: “one month before his  death”.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

23|5065|  Chapter: Permissibility of a person’s taking anyone along with him where the host is very  intimate with the guest.  Anas b. Malik reported: I visited Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) one day  and found him sitting in the company of his Companions and talking to them, and he  had tied his belly with a bandage. Usama said: I am in doubt whether there was stone  on that (his belly) or not. I asked some of his Companions why Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) had bandaged his belly. They said: (He has done that to relieve)  his hunger. I went to Abu Talha, the husband of Umm Sulaim, the daughter of Milhan,  and said to him: Father, I saw Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having  bandaged his belly. I asked some of his Companions (the reason of it) and they said         that it was due to hunger. Abu Talha came to my mother and said: Is there anything?  She said: Yes, I have some pieces of bread with me and some dates. If Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) comes to us alone we can feed him to his fill, but  if someone comes along with him this would be insufficient for them. The rest of the  hadith is the same.

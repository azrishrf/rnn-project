4|1658|  Chapter: The most excellent prayer is one in which one stands for a longer time.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When half  of the night or two-third of it is over. Allah, the Blessed and the Exalted, descends to the  lowest heaven and says: Is there any beggar, so that he be given? Is there any  supplicator so that he be answered? Is there any beggar of forgiveness so that he be  forgiven? (And Allah continues it saying) till it is daybreak.

32|6380|  Chapter: A person would be along with him whom he loves.  Anas b. Malik reported that a person came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) and said to Allah’s Messenger: When would be the Last Hour? Thereupon he (the  Holy Prophet) said: What preparation have you made for the Last Hour? He said: The  love of Allah and of His Messenger (is my only preparation). Thereupon he (the Holy  Prophet) said: You would be along with one whom you love. Anas said: Nothing pleased  us more after accepting Islam than the words of Allah’s Apostle: You would be along  with one whom you love. And Anas said. I love Allah and His Messenger and Abu Bakr  and Umar, and I hope that I would be along with them although I have not acted like  them.  OF RELATIONSHIP

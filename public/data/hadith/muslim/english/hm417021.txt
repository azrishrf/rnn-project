41|7021|  Chapter: The Dajjak would be very insignificant in the eye of Allah, the Majestic and Glorious.  Mughira b. Shu’ba reported that none asked Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  about Dajjal more than I asked him. I (one of the narrators other than Mughlra b.  Shu’ba) said: What did you ask? Mughira replied: I said that the people alleged that he  would have a mountain load of bread and mutton and rivers of water. Thereupon he  said: He would be more insignificant in the eye of Allah compared with all this.

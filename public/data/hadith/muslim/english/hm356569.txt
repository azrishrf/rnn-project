35|6569|  Chapter: Refuge from the evil of what one has done, and what one has not done.         Abdullah b. Mas’ud reported that when it was evening Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) used to supplicate: “We entered upon evening and the whole Kingdom of  Allah also entered upon evening and praise is due to Allah. There is no god but Allah,  the One Who has no partner with Him.” Hasan said that Zubaid reported to him that he  memorised it from Ibrahim in these very words. “His is the Sovereignty and Praise is  due to Him, and He is Potent over everything. O Allah, I beg of Thee the good of this  night and I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of this night and the evil which follows it. O  Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from sloth, from the evil of vanity. O Allah, I seek refuge in  Thee from torment in the Hell-Fire and from torment in the grave.”  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

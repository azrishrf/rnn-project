4|1804|  Chapter: That which concerns recitation.  Ibn ‘Abbas reported: I heard it from so many Companions of the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) and one among them is ‘Umar b. Khattab, and he is most  dear to me among them that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  prohibited observing of prayer after the dawn prayer till the sun rose and after the ‘Asr  till the sun set. This Hadith has been narrated by Qatada with the same chain of  transmitters with a minor alteration of words.

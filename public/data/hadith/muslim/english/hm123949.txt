12|3949|  Chapter: Disapproval of buying the donated property by the donor himself.  Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I donated a pedigree horse in the  path of Allah. Its possessor made it languish. I thought that he would sell it at a cheap  price. I asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about it, whereupon he said:  Don’t buy it and do not get back your charity, for one who gets back the charity is like a  dog who swallows its vomit. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Malik b.  Anas with the same chain of transmitters but with this addition: “Don’t buy that even if  he gives you for one dirham.”

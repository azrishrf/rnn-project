1|390|  Chapter: Pertaining to the words of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him): “I  would be the first among people to Intercede in the Paradise and among the Apostles I  would have the largest following”.  Abu Huraira said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Every  Messenger is endowed with a prayer which is granted and by which he would (pray to  his Lord) and it would he granted for him. I have, however, reserved my prayer for the  intercession of my Ummab on the Day of Resurrection.

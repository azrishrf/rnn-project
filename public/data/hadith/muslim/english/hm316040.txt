31|6040|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Dujana (Allah be pleased with him).  Anas reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took hold of his sword  on the Day of Uhud and said: Who would take it from me? All the persons stretched  their hands saying: I would do it, I would do it. He (Allah’s Apostle) said: Who would  take it in order to fulfil its rights? Then the people withdrew their hands. Simak b.  Kharasha Abu Dujana said: I am here to take it and fulfil its rights. He took it and struck  the heads of the polytheists.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

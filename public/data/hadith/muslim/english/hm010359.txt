1|359|  Chapter: Affirmation of intercession and rescue from Fire of the believers in Oneness of  Allah.  Abdullah b. Masâ€™ud reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  I know the last of the inhabitants of Fire to be taken out there-from, and the last of the  inhabitants of Paradise to enter it. A man will come out of the Fire crawling. Then Allah,  the Blessed and Exalted will say to him: Go and enter Paradise. So he would come to it  and it would appear to him as if it were full. He would go back and say: O my Lord ! I  found it full. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, would say to him: Go and enter Paradise.  He would come and perceive as if it were full. He would return and say: O my Lord ! I  found it full. Allah would say to him: Go and enter Paradise, for there is for you the like  of the world and ten times like it, or for you is ten times the like of this world. He (the  narrator) said: He (that man) would say: Art Thou making a fun of me? or Art Thou         laughing at me, though Thou art the King? He (the narrator) said: I saw the Messenger  of Allah laugh till his front teeth were visible. And it was said: That would be the lowest  rank among the inhabitants of Paradise.

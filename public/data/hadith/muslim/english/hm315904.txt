31|5904|  Chapter: The excellent qualities of ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Ibn Umar reported that when ‘Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul (the hypocrite) died, his son  Abdullah b. Abdullah came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon -him) and asked  him to give his shirt which should be used for the coffin of his father. He gave that to  him. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up to say prayer over him  Thereupon I Umar caught hold of the clothe of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) and said: Allah’s Messenger, are you going to offer prayer, whereas Allah has  forbidden to offer prayer for him, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) said: Allah has given me a choice saying: Ask forgiveness for them or you may not  ask for them; even if you ask for them seventy times, I will make an addition to the  seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said  prayer over him that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed the verse: “And never  pray over any one of them that has died and never should you stand by his grave” (ix.  84).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

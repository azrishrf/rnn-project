4|1721|  Chapter: Concerning dozing off in prayer, or faltering of one’s tongue in the recitation of  the Qur’an, or in mentioning of Allah, one should sleep, or stop it till one becomes lively.  ‘Aisha reported that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) listened to the  recitation of the Qur’an by a man in the mosque.

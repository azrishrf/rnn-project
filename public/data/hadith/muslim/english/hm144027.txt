14|4027|  Chapter: The vow is not to be fulfilled which is made in disobedience to Allah nor that  over which a man has no control.  Imran b. Husain reported that the tribe of Thaqif was the ally of Banu ‘Uqail. Thaqif took  two persons from amongst the Companions of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) as prisoners. The Companions of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  took one person at Banu Uqail as prisoner, and captured al-‘Adbi (the she-camel of the  Holy Prophet) along with him. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to him  and he was tied with ropes. He said: Muhammad. He came near him and said: What is  the matter with you? Thereupon he (the prisoner) said: Why have you taken me as  prisoner and why have you caught hold of one proceeding the pilgrims (the she-camel  as she carried the Holy Prophet on her back and walked ahead of the multitude)? He  (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yours is a great fault). I (my men) have caught hold of you for  the crime of your allies, Banu Thaqif. He (the Holy Prophet) then turned away. He again  called him and said: Muhammad, Muhammad, and since Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) was very compassionate, and tender-hearted, he returned to him,  and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am a Muslim, whereupon he (the Holy  Prophet) said: Had you said this when you had been the master of yourself, you would  have gained every success. He then turned away. He (the prisoner) called him again  saying: Muhammad, Muhammad. He came to him and said: What is the matter with  you? He said: I am hungry, feed me, and I am thirsty, so provide me with drink. He (the  Holy Prophet) said: That is (to satisfy) your want. He was then ransomed for two  persons (who had been taken prisoner by Thaqif). He (the narrator) said: A woman of         the Ansar had been taken prisoner and also al-Adbi’ was caught. The woman had been  tied with ropes. The people were giving rest to their animals before their houses. She  escaped one night from the bondage and came to the camels. As she drew near the  camels, they fretted and fumed and so she left them until she came to al-,Adbi’. It did  not fret and fume; it was docile She rode upon its back and drove it away and she went  off. When they (the enemies of Islam) were warned of this, they went in search of it, but  it (the she-camel) exhausted them. She (the woman) took vow for Allah, that in case He  would save her through it, she would offer that as a sacrifice. As she reached Medina,  the people saw her and they said: Here is al-Adbi, the she-camel of Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him). She (the woman) said that she had taken a vow that if Allah  would save her on its back, she would sacrifice it. They (the Prophet’s Companions)  came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to  him, whereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, how ill she rewarded it that she took vow to  Allah that if He saves her on its back, she would sacrifice it ! There is no fulfilment of the  vow in an act of disobedience, nor in an act over which a person has no control. In the  version of Ibn Hujr (the words are): “There is no vow in disobedience to Allah.”

39|6775|  Chapter: Moderation in giving sermon.         Shaqiq reported: We were sitting at the door of Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) waiting for him (to  come out and deliver a sermon to us). It was at this time that there happened to pass by  us Yazid b. Mu’awiya an-Nakha’i. We said: Inform him (‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud) of our  presence here. He went in and Abdullah b. Mas’ud lost no time in coming out to us and  said: I was informed of your presence here but nothing hindered me to come out to you  but the fact that I did not like to bore you (by stuffing your minds with sermons) as  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not deliver us sermon on certain days  fearing that it might prove to be boring for us.

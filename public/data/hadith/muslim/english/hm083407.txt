8|3407|  Chapter: Kitab Al-Rada’a-Book pertaining to fosterage.  ‘Ali (Allah be pleased with him) reported having said this: Messenger of Allah, why is it  that you select (your wife) from among the Quraish, but you ignore us (the nearest of  the kin)? Thereupon he said: Have you anything for me (a suitable match for me)? I  said; Yes, the daughter of Hamza, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon  him) said: She is not lawful for me, for she is the daughter of my brother by reason of  fosterage.

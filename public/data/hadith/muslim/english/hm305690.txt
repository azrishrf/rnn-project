30|5690|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  ‘Abdullah reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying; I shall be there at the  Cistern before you, and I shall have to contend for some people, but I shall have to yield. I would  be saying: My Lord, they are my friends, they are my friends, and it would be said: You don’t know  what innovations they made after you.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

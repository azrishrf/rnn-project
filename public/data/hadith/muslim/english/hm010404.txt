1|404|  Chapter: Regarding the words of Allah: “And warn thy nearest kindred”.  Qabisa b. al-Mukhariq and Zuhair b. ‘Amr reported: When this verse was revealed: “And  warn thy nearest kindred,” the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) set off towards  a rock of the hill and ascended the highest of the rocks and then called: O sons of ‘Abd  Manaf! I am a warner; my similitude and your similitude is like a man who saw the  enemy and went to guard his people, but, being afraid they might get there before him,  he shouted: Be on your guard!

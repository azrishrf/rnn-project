Thauban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) reported  Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who offered prayer for the  dead, for him is the reward of one qirat, and he who attended its burial, he would have  two qirats as his reward. And qirat is equivalent to Uhud.

42|7124|  Chapter: It is forbidden to publicise one’s sins.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: All the  people of my Ummah would get pardon for their sins except those who publicise them.  And (it means) that a servant should do a deed during the night and tell the people in         the morning that he has done so and so, whereas Allah has concealed it. And he does a  deed during the day and when it is night he tells the people, whereas Allah has  concealed it. Zuhair has used the word hijar for publicising.

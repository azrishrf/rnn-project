41|7037|  Chapter: The Remaining Ahadith Pertaining to the Dajjal.  Abu Qatada reported: We used to go to Imran b. Husain passing in front of Hisham b.  ‘Amir. He, one day, said: You pass by me (in order) to go to some persons but (amongst  the living persons) none remained in the company of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) more than I and none knows more ahadith than I heard Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would be no creation (creating more trouble)  than the Dajjal right from the creation of Adam to the Last Hour.

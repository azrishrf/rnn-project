10|3901|  Chapter: Shuf’a (pre-emption).  Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported: There came a slave and pledged allegiance  to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) on migration; he (the Holy Prophet) did not  know that he was a slave. Then there came his master and demanded him back,  whereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Sell him to me. And he  bought him for two black slaves, and he did not afterwards take allegiance from anyone  until he had asked him whether he was a slave (or a free man).

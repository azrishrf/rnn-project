1|255|  Chapter: Warning for one appropriating the right of a Muslim by taking a false oath: the  fire (of Hell) is his chastisement.  It is narrated on the authority of Abdullah that he heard the Prophet (may peace be  upon him) saying: He who took an oath in order to entitle himself (to the possession) of  a property, whereas he is a liar, would meet Allah in a state that He would be very much  angry with him. Then the remaining part of the hadith was narrated as transmitted by  Aâ€™mash but with the exception of these words: There was a dispute between me and  another person in regard to a well. We referred this dispute to the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him). Upon this he remarked: Either (you should produce) two  witnesses (to support your contention) or his oath (would be accepted as valid).

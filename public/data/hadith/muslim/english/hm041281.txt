4|1281|  Chapter: He who came up with the Rak’ah, he in fact came up with the prayer (led in  congregation with the Imam).  Abu Musa reported on the authority of his father that an Inquirer came to the Prophet  (may peace be upon him) and asked him about the times of prayers, and the rest of the  Hadith is the same (as narrated above) but for these words: “On the second day he (the  Holy Prophet) observed the evening prayer before the disappearance of the twilight.”

4|1682|  Chapter: Encouragement to observe prayers during Ramadhan and that is Tarawih.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Abbas reported: He spent (one night) in the house of the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him). He (the Holy Prophet) got up, brushed his teeth and  performed ablution and said: “In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the  alternation of the night and the day, there are indeed signs for people of understanding”  (al-Qur’an, iii. 190), to the end of the Surah. He then stood up and prayed two rak’ahs,  standing, bowing and prostrating himself at length in them. Then he finished, went to  sleep and snored. He did that three times, six rak’ahs altogether, each time cleaning his  teeth, performing ablution, and reciting these verses. Then he observed three rak’ahs of  Witr. The Mu’adhdhin then pronounced the Adhan and he went out for prayer and was  saying,: “O Allah I place light in my heart, light in my tongue, place light in my hearing,  place light in my eyesight, place light behind me, and light in front of me, and place light  above me, and light below me. O Allah ! grant me light.”

Anas b. Malik said: I went along with Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) to that feast. He presented to Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) barley bread and soup containing pumpkin, and sliced pieces of meat.  Anas said: I saw Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) going after the pumpkin  round the dish, so I have always liked the pumpkin since that day.

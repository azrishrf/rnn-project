1|399|  Chapter: Regarding the words of Allah: “And warn thy nearest kindred”.  Abu Huraira reported: When this verse was revealed: “And warn thy nearest kindred (al- Qur’an, xxvi. 214), the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called the Quraish;  so they gathered and he gave them a general warning. Then he made a particular         (reference to certain tribes) and said: O sons of Ka’b b. Luwayy, rescue yourselves from  the Fire; O sons of Murra b. Ka’b, rescue yourselves from the Fire: O sons of Abd  Shams, rescue yourselves from the Fire; O sons of Abd Manaf rescue yourselves from  the Fire; O sons of Hashim, rescue yourselves from the Fire; O sons of Abd al-Muttalib,  rescue yourselves from the Fire; O Fatimah, rescue thyself from the Fire, for I have no  power (to protect you) from Allah in anything except this that I would sustain relationship  with you.

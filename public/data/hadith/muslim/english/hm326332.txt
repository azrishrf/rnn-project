32|6332|  Chapter: He who goes in the mosque or in the bazaar or a place of gathering like it with  a weapon should see that the spearhead does not harm anyone.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported that a person happened to come to the mosque with arrows  and their iron-ends were exposed, so he was commanded that he should grasp the  pointed heads so that these might not do any harm to a Muslim.

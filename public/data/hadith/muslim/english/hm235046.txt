23|5046|  Chapter: The merit of licking the fingers after taking food and wiping the dish (with fingers) and  eating of the fallen mouthful after removing the dirt sticking to it.  Jabir reported: I heard Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: The Satan is  present with any one of you in everything he does; he is present even when he eats  food; so if any one of you drops a mouthful he should remove away anything filthy on it  and eat it and not leave for the devil; and when he finishes (food) he should lick his  fingers, for he does not know in what portion of his food the blessing lies.

Abu Salama asked ‘Aisha about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) She said: He observed thirteen rak’ahs (in the night prayer). He observed  eight rak’ahs and would then observe Witr and then observe two rak’ahs sitting, and  when he wanted to bow he stood up and then bowed down, and then observed two  rak’ahs in between the Adhan and Iqama of the dawn prayer.

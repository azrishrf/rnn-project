23|4984|  Chapter: It is good to drink milk.  Al-Bara’ reported: When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went forth from  Mecca to Medina, Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju’shum pursued him. Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) invoked curse upon him, and his horse sank (in the desert). He  (Suraqa) said: (Allah’s Messenger), invoke blessings for me and I will do no harm to  you. He (the Holy Prophet) then supplicated Allah. (At that time) he (the Holy Prophet)  felt thirsty, and they happened to pass by a shepherd. Abu Bakr Siddiq said: I took hold  of a bowl and milked some milk into it for Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  and gave it to him. He drank it and I was pleased.

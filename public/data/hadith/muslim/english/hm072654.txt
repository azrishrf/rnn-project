7|2654|  Chapter: What is permitted for the Muhrim (wearer of Ihram) in Hajj and Umra, what is  not permissible and forbiddance of the use of perfume.  Ya’la b. Umayya reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with them) that  a person came to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as he was at Ji’rana  and he (the person) had been putting on a cloak which was perfumed, or he (the  narrator) said: There was a trace of yellowness on it. He said (to the Holy Prophet):  What do you command me to do during my Umra? (It was at this juncture) that the  revelation came to the Apostle of Allah (way peace be upon him) and he was covered  with a cloth, and Ya’la said: Would that I see revelation coming to the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him). He (Hadrat ‘Umar) said: Would it please you to see the  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) receiving the revelations ‘Umar lifted a corner  of the cloth and I looked at him and he was emitting a sound of snorting. He (the  narrator) said: I thought it was the sound of a camel. When he was relieved of this he  said: Where is he who asked about Umra? When the person came, the Holy Prophet  (may peace be upon him) said: Wash out the trace of yellowness, or he said: the trace  of perfume and put off the cloak and do in your ‘Umra what you do in your Hajj.

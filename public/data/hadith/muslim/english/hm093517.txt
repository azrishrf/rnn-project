9|3517|  Chapter: There is no maintenance allowance for one who has been given irrevocable  divorce.  Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported that she had been married to Abu  ‘Amr b. Hafs b. al-Mughira and he divorced her with three pronouncements. She stated  that she went to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asking him about  abandoning that house. He commanded her to move to the house of Ibn Umm Maktum,  the blind. Marwan refused to testify the divorced woman abandoning her house (before  the ‘Idda was over). ‘Urwa said that ‘Aisha objected to (the words of) Fatima bint Qais.  This hadith has been transmitted through another chain of narrators.

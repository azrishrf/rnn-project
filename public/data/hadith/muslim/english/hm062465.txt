6|2465|  Chapter: Sexual Intercourse is completely forbidden during the day in the month of Ramadhan.  Abbad b. Abdullah b. Zubair reported that he had heard â€˜Aisha, the wife of the Apostle  of Allah (may peace be upon him), as saying: A person came to the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) in the mosque during (the month of) Ramadan and said:  Messenger of Allah, I am burnt I am burnt, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) asked him as to what the matter was. Upon this he said: I had  intercourse with my wife (in a state of fasting) Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said:  Give charity. Upon this he said: Apostle of Allah, I swear by God, there is nothing with  me (to give in charity) as I do not possess anything. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Sit         down. So he sat down and he was in this very state when there came a person urging a  donkey with a load of eatables upon it. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) said: Where is that burnt one who was just here? Thereupon the person stood up.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Give this (eatables brought by  the man) in charity. Upon this the person said: Messenger of Allah, can there be anyone  else (more deserving than I)? By Allah, we are hungry, we have nothing with us. Upon  this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Then eat (these eatables).

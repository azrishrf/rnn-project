29|5648|  Chapter: The vision of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  Abdullah b. ‘Umar reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I  saw in a dream that I was using miswak and the two persons contended to get it from  me, the one being older than the other one. I gave the miswak to the younger one. It  was said to me to give that to the older one and I gave it to the older one.

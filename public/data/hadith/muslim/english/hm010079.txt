1|79|  Chapter: Concerning the facts that Interdiction against abominable is a part of Faith,  that Faith increases and diminishes; enjoining that which is good and for bidding that  which is abominable are obligatory(acts).  It is narrated on the authority of Tariq b. Shihab: It was Marwan who initiated (the  practice) of delivering khutbah (address) before the prayer on the ‘Id day. A man stood  up and said: Prayer should precede khutbah. He (Marwan) remarked, This (practice)  has been done away with. Upon this Abu Sa’id remarked: This man has performed (his  duty) laid on him. I heard the Messenger of Allah as saying: He who amongst you sees  something abominable should modify it with the help of his hand; and if he has not  strength enough to do it, then he should do it with his tongue, and if he has not strength  enough to do it, (even) then he should (abhor it) from his heart, and that is the least of  faith.

37|6635|  Chapter: The mercy of Allah predominates his wrath.  ‘Umar b. Khattab reported that there were brought some prisoners to Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) amongst whom there was also a woman, who was searching  (for someone) and when she found a child amongst the prisoners, she took hold of it,  pressed it against her chest and provided it suck. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: Do you think this woman would ever afford to throw her child  in the Fire? We said: By Allah, so far as it lies in her power, she would never throw the  child in Fire.’ Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah is  more kind to His servants than this woman is to her child.

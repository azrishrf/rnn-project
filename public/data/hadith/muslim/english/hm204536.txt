20|4536|  Chapter: Obedience to the ruler is forbidden in matters sinful, but is otherwise  obligatory.  It has been narrated on the authority of ‘All who said: The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) sent an expedition and appointed over the Mujahids a man from  the Ansar. (While making the appointment), he ordered that his work should be listened  to and obeyed. They made him angry in a matter. He said: Collect for me dry wood.  They collected it for him. Then he said: Kindle a fire. They kindled (the fire). Then he  said: Didn’t the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) order you to listen to me  and obey (my orders)? They said: Yes. He said: Enter the fire. The narrator says: (At  this), they began to look at one another and said: We fled from the fire to (find refuge  with) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (and now you order us to enter  it). They stood quiet until his anger cooled down and the fire went out. When they  returned, they related the incident to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).  He said: If they had entered it, they would not have come out. Obedience (to the  commander) is obligatory only in what is good.

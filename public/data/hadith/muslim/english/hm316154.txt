31|6154|  Chapter: The merits of the companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and of  those who are next to them and then of those who are next to them.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may, peace be upon him) as saying: The best  age of my Umma is one in which I was sent (by Allah as an Apostle), then the one next  to that. (The narrator said): And Allah knows best whether he stated this third (time) or  not. Then there would come people who would love (to look) bulky and they would  hasten to the witness box before they are asked to bear witness.               HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

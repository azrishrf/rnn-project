1|330|  Chapter: Concerning Sidrat-ul-Muntabi (remotest Lote tree).  Al-Shaibini reported to us: I asked Zirr b. Hubaish about the words of Allah (the Mighty  and Great): “So he was (at a distance) of two bows or nearer” (al-Qur’an, liii 8). He said:  Ibn Mas’ud informed me that, verily, the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw  Gabriel and he had six hundred wings.

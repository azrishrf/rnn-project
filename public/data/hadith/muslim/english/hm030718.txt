3|718|  Chapter: Tayammum.  Abd al-Rahmin b. Abza narrated It on the authority of his father that a man came to  ‘Umar and said: I am (at times) affected by seminal emission but find no water. He  (‘Umar) told him not to say prayer. ‘Ammar then said: Do you remember, O Commander  of the Faithful, when I and you were in a military detachment and we had had a seminal  emission and did not find water (for taking bath) and you did not say prayer, but as for  myself I rolled in dust and said prayer, and (when it was mentioned before) the Apostle  (may peace be upon him) said: It was enough for you to strike the ground with your  hands and then blow (the dust) and then wipe your face and palms. Umar said: ‘Ammar,  fear Allah. He said: If you so like, I would not narrate it.  A Hadith like this has been transmitted with the same chain of transmitters but for the  words: ‘Umar said: We hold you responsible for what you claim.”

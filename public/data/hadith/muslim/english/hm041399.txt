Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Anyone  amongst you who sat in a place of worship waiting for the prayer is in prayer and his  ablution is not broken, the angels invoke blessing upon him (in these words): O Allah  !pardon him. O Allah ! have mercy upon him.

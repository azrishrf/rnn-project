19|4428|  Chapter: The persecution of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) at the hands of the  infidels and hypocrites.  It has been narrated on the authority of Aswad b. Qais who heard Jundub saying that  Gabriel delayed his visit to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) The  polytheists began to say that Muhammad has been forsaken. At this Allah, the Glorious  and Exalted, revealed: “Wa’dd hd wa’l-laili iza saja, ma wadda’ka Rabbuka wa’ ma qala”         [By the glorious morning light, and by the night when it is still: thy Lord has not forsaken  thee, nor is He displeased].

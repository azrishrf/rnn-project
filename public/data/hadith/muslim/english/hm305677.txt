30|5677|  Chapter: The finality of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Jabir reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The similitude of mine and  that of the Apostles is like that of a person who built a house and he completed it and made it  perfect but for the space of a brick. People entered therein and they were surprised at it and said:  Had there been a brick (it would have been complete in all respects). Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: I am that place where the brick (completing the building is to be placed),  and I have come to finalise the chain of Apostles.

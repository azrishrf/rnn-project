24|5252|  Chapter: Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.  Abu Tilha, the Companion of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), reported  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said: Verily, angels do not enter the  house in which there is a picture. Busr reported: Zaid fell ill and we went to inquire after  his health and (found) that there was hanging at his door a curtain with a picture on it. I  said to ‘Ubaidullah Khaulani who had been under the patronage of Maimuna, the wife of  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him): Did not Zaid himself inform us before about  (the Holy Prophet’s command pertaining to the pictures), whereupon ‘Ubaidullah said:  Did you not hear when he said: “Except the prints on the cloth”?

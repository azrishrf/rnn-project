Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that there was a person in the state of  Ihram whose camel broke his neck and he died. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: Bathe him with water mixed (with the leaves of) lote tree  and shroud him In his two (pieces of) cloth and cover neither his head nor his face, for  he would be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing Talbiya.

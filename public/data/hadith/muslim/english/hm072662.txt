Salim reported on the authority of his father (‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar) that the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The people of Medina should enter upon the state  of Ihram at Dhu’l-Hulaifa; the people of Syria at Juhfa, the people of Najd at Qarn (al- Manazil). Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) said: It was mentioned to me but I did  not myself bear it (directly) from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  having said this: The people of Yemen should enter upon the state of Ihram at  Yalamlam.

2|432|  Chapter: Merit of Wudu.  Abu Malik at-Ash’ari reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  Cleanliness is half of faith and al-Hamdu Liliah (Praise be to Allah) fills the scale, and  Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah) and al-Hamdu Liliah (Praise be to Allah) fill-up what is  between the heavens and the earth, and prayer is a light, and charity is proof (of one’s  faith) and endurance is a brightness and the Holy Qur’an is a proof on your behalf or  against you. All men go out early in the morning and sell themselves, thereby setting  themselves free or destroying themselves.

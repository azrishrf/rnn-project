1|136|  Chapter: The love of Ansar (helpers) and â€˜All (may Allah be pleased with all of them) is  (an Ingredient) of Iman and (one of) its signs, and hatred against them is a sign of  dissemblance.  It is reported on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace and  blessings Be upon him) observed: The sign of a hypocrite is the hatred against the  Ansar and the sign of a believer is the love for the Ansar.

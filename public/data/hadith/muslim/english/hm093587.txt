9|3587|  Chapter: The right of inheritance of property vests with one who emancipates the slave.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Barira came to me and said: My family  (owners) have made contract with me (for granting freedom) for nine ‘uqiyas (of silver)  payable in nine years, one ‘uqiya every year. Help me (in making this payment). I said  to her: If your family so desires, I am prepared to make them the full payment in one  installment, and thus secure freedom for you, but the right of inheritance will vest in me,  if I do so. She (Barira) made a mention of that to her family, but they refused (except) on  the condition that the right of inheritance would vest in them. She came to me and made  mention of if She (‘Aisha) said: I scolded her. She (Barira) said: By Allah, it is not  possible (they will never agree to it). And as she was saying it, Allah’s messenger (may  peace be upon him) heard, and he asked me, I informed him and he said: Buy her and  emancipate her, and let the right of inheritance vest in them, for they cannot claim it  (rightfully) since the right of inheritance vests with one who emancipates (the slave;  therefore, these people have no right to lay such false claims). And I did so. She  (‘Aisha) said: Then Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) delivered a sermon in  the evening. He extolled Allah and praised Him with what He deserves, and then said  afterwards,: What has happened to the people that they lay down conditions which are         not found in the Book of Allah? And the condition which is not found in the Book of Allah  is invalid, even if its number is one hundred. The Book of Allah is more true (than any  other deed) and the condition laid down by Allah is more binding (than any other  condition). What has happened to the people among you that someone among you  says: “Emancipate so and so, but the right of inheritance vests in me”? Verily, the right  of inheritance vests in one who emancipates.

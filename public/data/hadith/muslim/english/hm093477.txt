9|3477|  Chapter: It is forbidden to divorce the woman during her menses.  Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife during the  period of menses. ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him) asked Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him), and he commanded him (‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar) to have her back and then  allow her respite until she enters the period of the second menses, and then allow her  respite until she is purified, then divorce her (finally) before touching her (having a  sexual intercourse with her), for that is the prescribed period which Allah commanded  (to be kept in view) for divorcing the women. When Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with  them) was asked about the person who divorces his wife in the state of menses, he  said: If you pronounced one divorce or two, Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) had commanded him to take her back, and then allow her respite until she enters  the period of the second menses, and then allow her respite until she is purified, and  then divorce her (finally) before touching her (having a sexual intercourse with her); and  if you have pronounced (three divorces at one and the same time) you have in fact  disobeyed your Lord with regard to what He commanded you about divorcing your wife.  But she is however (finally separated from you).

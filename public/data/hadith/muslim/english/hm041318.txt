4|1318|  Chapter: Preference for saying the 窶連sr prayer at the commencement of the prescribed time.  Jabir b. 窶連bdullah reported that Umar b. al-Khattab had been cursing the pagans of the  Quraish and the day (of the Battle) of Khandaq (Ditch). (He came to the Holy Prophet)  and said: Messenger of Allah, by God, I could not say the 窶連sr prayer till the sun set.  Upon this the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: By Allah I, too, have not  observed it. So we went to a valley. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  performed ablution and we too performed ablution, and then the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said the 窶連sr prayer after the sun had set and then said the  evening prayer after it.

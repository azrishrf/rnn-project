41|6925|  Chapter: The last hour would come when the Romans would have the maximum population.  Mustaurid al-Qurashi reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as  saying: The Last Hour would come (when) the Romans would form a majority amongst  people. ‘Amr said to him (Mustaurid Qurashi): See what you are saying? He said: I say  what I heard from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Thereupon he said: If  you say that, it is a fact for they have four qualities. They have the patience to undergo  a trial and immediately restore themselves to sanity after trouble and attack again after  flight. They (have the quality) of being good to the destitute and the orphans, to the  weak and, fifthly, the good quality in them is that they put resistance against the  oppression of kings.

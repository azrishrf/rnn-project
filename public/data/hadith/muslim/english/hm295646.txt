29|5646|  Chapter: Pertaining to the interpretation of dreams.  Ibn ‘Abbas reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to say to his  Companions: He who amongst you sees a vision should narrate it and I would interpret  it for him, and a person came and said: Allah’s Messenger, I saw a canopy. The rest of  the hadith is the same.

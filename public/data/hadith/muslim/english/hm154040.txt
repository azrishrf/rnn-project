15|4040|  Chapter: It is forbidden to take the oaths in the name of anyone else besides Allah.  Ibn ‘Umar heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who has to  take an oath, he must not take oath but by Allah. The Quraish used to take oath by their  fathers. So he (the Holy Prophet) said: Do not take oath by your fathers.

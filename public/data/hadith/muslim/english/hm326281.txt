32|6281|  Chapter: It is forbidden to curse the beasts.  Zaid b. Aslam reported that ‘Abd al-Malik b. Marwan sent some domestic goods for  decoration to Umm Darda’ on his own behalf, and when it was night ‘Abd al-Malik got up  and called for the servant. It seemed as if he (the servant) was late (in responding to his  call), so he (‘Abd al-Malik) invoked curse upon him, and when it was morning Umm  Darda’ said to him: I heard you cursing your servant during the night when you called  him, and she said: I heard Abu Darda’ as saying that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) said: The invoker of curse would neither be intercessor nor witness on the  Day of Resurrection.

20|4609|  Chapter: It is forbidden to take the Qur’an to the land of the infidels when it is feared  that it might fall into their hands.  It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: Do not take the Qur’an on a journey with you, for I am afraid  lost it should fall into the hands of the enemy. Ayyub (one of the narrators in the chain of  transmitters) said: The enemy may seize it and may quarrel with you over it.

21|4816|  Chapter: It is forbidden to tie the animal and make it a target of arrows.  Sa’id b. Jubair reported that Ibn ‘Umar happened to pass by some young men of the  Quraish who had tied a bird (and this made it a target) at which they had been shooting  arrows Every arrow that they missed came into the possession of the owner of the bird.  So no sooner did they see Ibn ‘Umar they went away. Thereupon Ibn ‘Umar said: Who  has done this? Allah has cursed him who does this. Verily Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) invoked curse upon one who made a live thing the target (of one’s  marksmanship).

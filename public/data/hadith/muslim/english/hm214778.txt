21|4778|  Chapter: The eating of the flesh of domestic asses is unlawful.  Anas b. Malik reported: When it was the Day of Khaibar a visitor came and said:  Messenger of Allah, the asses have been eaten. Then another came and said:  Messenger of Allah, the asses are being destroyed. Then Allahâ€™s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) commanded Abu Talha to make an announcement that Allah and  His Messenger have prohibited you (from eating) of the flesh of (domestic) asses, for  these are loathsome or impure. He (the narrator) said: The earth in pots were turned  over along with what was in them.

1|18|  Chapter: Concerning the saying of the Apostle; Islam is founded on five  (fundamentals).  It is narrated on the authority of (‘Abdullah) son of Umar (may Allah be pleased with  them) that the Holy Prophet (may peace of Allah be upon him) said: (The superstructure  of) al-Islam is raised on five (pillars), i.e. the oneness of Allah, the establishment of  prayer, payment of Zakat, the, fast of Ramadan, Pilgrimage (to Mecca).  A person said (to ‘Abdullah b. Umar the narrator): Which of the two precedes the other- Pilgrimage or the fasts of Rarnadan? Upon this he (the narrator) replied: No (it is not the  Pilgrimage first) but the fasts of Ramadan precede the Pilgrimage.

23|4909|  Chapter: It is not approved to prepare Nabidh by mixing dry dates and grapes.  Abu Huraira reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade (the  preparation of Nabidh) from grapes and dates, and unripe dates and dry dates (by  mixing them together). He (the Holy Prophet also) said: Prepare Nabidh from each one  of them separately. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira  through another chain of transmitters.

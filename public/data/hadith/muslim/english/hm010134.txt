1|134|  Chapter: The unbelief of one who said: We got rainfall by the movement (of the stars).  It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  and blessing be upon him) observed: Allah does not shower His blessings from the         heaven that in the morning a group of men disbelieve it (to be a blessing from Allah).  Allah sends down rain, but they (the disbelievers) say: Such and such star (is  responsible for that).

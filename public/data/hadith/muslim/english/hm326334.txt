32|6334|  Chapter: He who goes in the mosque or in the bazaar or a place of gathering like it with  a weapon should see that the spearhead does not harm anyone.  Abd Musa reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: When any  one of you happens to go to a meeting or the bazar with an arrow in his hand he must  grasp its pointed head; then (he again said): He must grasp its pointed head. Abu Musa  said: By Allah, we did not court death until some of us had flung arrows upon the faces  of one another.  OF RELATIONSHIP

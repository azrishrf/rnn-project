12|3974|  Chapter: Al-‘Umra (Life grant).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah al-Ansari (Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: Whoever a person conferred Umra (life grant) upon a person  and he says: I confer upon you this and upon your descendants and anyone who  survives you, and that becomes his possession and that of his posterity. It would  become (a permanent possession) of those who were conferred upon this gift, and it  would not return to its owner (donor), for he gave that as a gift in which accrued the right  of inheritance.

35|6554|  Chapter: Supplication at the time of sleeping and going to bed.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When any  one of you goes to bed, he should take hold of the hem of his lower garment and then  should clean (his bed) with the help of that and then should recite the name of Allah for  he himself does not know what he left behind him on his bed, and when he intends to lie  on bed, he should lie on his right side and utter these words: “Hallowed be Allah, my  Lord. It is with Thine (grace) that I place my side (upon the bed) and it is with Thee that I  take it up (after sleep), and in case Thou withholdst my being (if thou causest me to  die), then grant pardon to my being, and if Thou keepst (this process of breathing on),  then protect it with that with which Thou protected Thine pious servants.”  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

20|4602|  Chapter: How the women swore fealty (to the Holy Prophet).  It has been narrated on the authority of ‘Aisha, the wife of the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him). She said: When the believing women migrated (to Medina) and came to  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), they would be tested in accordance  with the following words of Allah, the Almighty and Exalted: “O Prophet, when believing  women come to thee to take the oath of fealty to thee that they will not associate in  worship anything with God, that they will not steal that, they will not commit adultery...”  to the end of the verse (lx. 62).  Whoso from the believing women accepted these conditions and agreed to abide by  them were considered to have offered themselves for swearing fealty. When they had  (formally) declared their resolve to do so, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon  him) would say to them: You may go. I have confirmed your fealty. By God, the hand of         the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) never touched the hand of a woman.  He would take the oath of fealty from them by oral declaration. By God, the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) never took any vow from women except that which  God had ordered him to take, and his palm never touched the palm of a woman. When  he had taken their vow, he would tell them that he had taken the oath from them orally.

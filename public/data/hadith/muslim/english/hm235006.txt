23|5006|  Chapter: Etiquette relating to eating and drinking.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  When a person enters his house and mentions the name of Allah at the time of entering  it and while eating the food, Satan says (addressing himself: You have no place to  spend the night and no evening meal; but when he enters without mentioning the name  of Allah, the Satan says: You have found a place to spend the night, and when he does  not mention the name of Allah while eating food, he (the Satan) says: You have found a  place to spend the night and evening meal. This hadith has been narrated on the  authority of Jabir b. Abdullah through the same chain of transmitters but with a slight  variation of wording.

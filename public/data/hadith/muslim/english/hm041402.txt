4|1402|  Chapter: Merit of praying in congregation and waiting for prayer.  Ubayy b. Kaâ€™b reported: There was a man, and I do not know of any other man, whose  house was farther than his from the mosque and he never missed the prayer (in  congregation). It was said to him or I said to him: It you were to buy a donkey you could  ride upon it In the dark nights and in the burning sand. He said: I do not like my house to  be situated by the side of the mosque, for I (eagerly) desire that my steps towards the  mosque and back from it, should be recorded when I return to my family. Upon this the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Allah has gathered all (rewards) for  you.

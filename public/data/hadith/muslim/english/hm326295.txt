32|6295|  Chapter: He upon whom Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) invoked curse  whereas he in fact did not deserve it, it would be a source of reward and mercy for him.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I have  held covenant with Thee which Thou wouldst not break, so for any believer whom I  curse or beat, make that an expiation on the Day of Resurrection.

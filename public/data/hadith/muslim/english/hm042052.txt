4|2052|  Chapter: Concerning the shrouding of the dead body.  ‘Aisha reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was shrouded in  three cotton garments of white Yamani stuff from Sahul, among which was neither a  shirt nor a turban; and so far as Hullah is concerned there was some doubt about it in  the minds of people, that it was brought for him in order to shroud him with it, but it was  abandoned, and he was shrouded in three cotton garments of white Yamani stuff from  Sahul. Then ‘Abdullah b. Abu Bakr got it and said: I would keep it in order to shroud  myself in it. He then said: If Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, would have desired it for  His Apostle, he would have been shrouded with it. So he sold it and gave its price in  charity.

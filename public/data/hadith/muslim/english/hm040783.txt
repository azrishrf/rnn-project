Husain reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led us In  Zuhr or â€˜Asr prayer (noon or the afternoon prayer). (On concluding it) he said: Who  recited behind me (the verses): Sabbih Isma Rabbik al-Ala (Glorify the name of thy  Lord, the Most High)? There upon a person said: It was I, but I intended nothing but  goodness. I felt that some one of you was disputing with me in it (or he was taking out  from my tongue what I was reciting), said the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).

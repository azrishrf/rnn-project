20|4542|  Chapter: When a ruler enjoins God consciousness and does justice. he will have a  (great) reward.         It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Prophet of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: A commander (of the Muslims) is a shield for them. They fight  behind him and they are protected by (him from tyrants and aggressors). If he enjoins  fear of God, the Exalted and Glorious, and dispenses justice, there will be a (great)  reward for him; and if he enjoins otherwise, it redounds on him.

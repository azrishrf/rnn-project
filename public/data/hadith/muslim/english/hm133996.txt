13|3996|  Chapter: Will can be made only for one-third.  Ibn Sa’d reported his father as saying: Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) visited  me during my illness. I said: I am willing away the whole of my property. He said: No. I  said: Then half? He said: No. I said: Should I will away one-third? He said: Yes, and  even one-third is enough.

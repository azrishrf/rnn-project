30|5805|  Chapter: How long did the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) stay in Medina and  Mecca.  ‘Ammar, the freed slave of Banu Hashim, reported: I asked Ibn ‘Abbas how old was he  when death overtook the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: I little  know that such a thing is not known to a man like you who belong to his people. He  said: I asked people about it but they differed with me, and I liked to know your opinion  about it. He said: Do you know counting? He said: Yes. He then said: Bear this in mind  very well that he was commissioned (as a Prophet) at the age of forty, and he stayed in  Mecca for fifteen years; sometime in peace and sometime in dread, and (lived) for ten  years after his migration to Medina.

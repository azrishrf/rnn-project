24|5273|  Chapter: Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.  Anas b. Malik said: I was sitting with Ibn Ahbas when he gave religious verdicts but he  did not say that it was Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had said that.  However when a man said to him (Ibn ‘Abbas): I am the painter of these pictures. Ibn  ‘Abbas said: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who  painted pictures in the world would be compelled to breathe soul in them on the Day of  Resurrection, but he would not be able to breathe soul (in them).

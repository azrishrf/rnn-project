7|2952|  Chapter: Returning from ‘Arafat to Muzdalifa and excellence of observing sunset and  ‘Isha prayers together at Muzdalifa.  Ubaidullah b. ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased  with them) that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) combined the sunset and  ‘Isha, prayers at Muzdalifa and there was no prostration (i.e. any rak’ahs of Sunan or  Nawafil prayers) in between them. He observed three rak’ahs of the sunset prayer and  two rak’ahs of the ‘Isha prayer, and ‘Abdullah (b. ‘Umar) observed the prayers in this  very manner (at Muzdalifa) until he met his Lord.

8|3371|  Chapter: Al-Azl (incomplete sexual intercourse): Coitus Interruptus.  Abu Sirma said to Abu Sa’id al Khadri (Allah he pleased with him): O Abu Sa’id, did you  hear Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) mentioning al-‘azl? He said: Yes, and  added: We went out with Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) on the expedition  to the Bi’l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them,  for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also  desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by  observing ‘azl (Withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid  conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah’s Messenger is amongst  us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him), and  he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the  Day of Resurrection will be born.

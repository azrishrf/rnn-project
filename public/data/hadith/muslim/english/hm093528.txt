9|3528|  Chapter: There is no maintenance allowance for one who has been given irrevocable  divorce.  Abu Bakr b. Abu’l-Jahm reported: I and Abu Salama b ‘Abd al-Rahman came to fatima  bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) and asked her (about divorce, etc.). She said: I  was the wife of Abu ‘Amr b. Hafs b. al-Mughira, and he set out to join the battle of  Najran. The rest of the hadith is the same, but he made this addition: “She said: I  married him and Allah honoured me on account of Ibn Zaid and Allah favoured me  because of him.”

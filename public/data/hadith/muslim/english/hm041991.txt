4|1991|  Chapter: Mention of the torment of grave in eclipse prayer.  ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Samura said: During the lifetime of Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) I was shooting my arrows in Medina, when an eclipse of the sun took  place. I, therefore, threw them away and said, I must see how the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) acts in a solar eclipse today. When I came to him, he had  been supplicating with his hands, raised, pronouncing Allah-o-Akbar, praising Him,  acknowledging that He is One God till the eclipse was over, then he recited two surahs  and prayed two rak’ahs.

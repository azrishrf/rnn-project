1|236|  Chapter: Whenever a person intends to do a good deed, it is recorded, but whenever  he intends to commit evil, it is not written.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) observed: He who intended to do good, but did not do it, one good was  recorded for him, and he who intended to do good and also did it, ten to seven hundred         good deeds were recorded for him. And he who intended evil, but did not commit it, no  entry was made against his name, but if he committed that, it was recorded.

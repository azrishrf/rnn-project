15|4100|  Chapter: Reward of the slave when he is loyal to bit master and is good in worshipping  Allah.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When a  slave fulfils obligation of Allah and obligation of his master, he has two rewards for him. I  narrated this to Ka’b, and Ka’b said: (Such a slave) has no accountability, nor has a  poor believer.

4|803|  Chapter: The Tashahhud in prayer.  Abdullah b. Zaid-he who was shown the call (for prayer in a dream) narrated it on the  authority of Mas’ad al-Ansari who said: We were sitting in the company of Sa’id b.  ‘Ubida when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to us. Bashir b.  S’ad said: Allah has commanded us to bless you. Messenger of Allah! But how should  we bless you? He (the narrator) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  kept quiet (and we were so much perturbed over his silence) that we wished we had not  asked him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then said: (For blessing  me) say: “O Allah, bless Muhammad and the members of his household as Thou didst  bless the members of Ibrahim’s household. Grant favours to Muhammad and the  members of his household as Thou didst grant favours to the members of the  household of Ibrahim in the world. Thou art indeed Praiseworthy and Glorious”; and  salutation as you know.

9|3599|  Chapter: It is forbidden for a slave to take anyone as his ally except one who  emancipates him.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) said: He who takes anyone as his ally without the consent of his previous  master, there will be the curse of Allah and that of His angels upon him, and neither,  any obligatory act of his nor the supererogatory one will be accepted (by Allah).

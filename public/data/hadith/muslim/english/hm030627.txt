3|627|  Chapter: The quantity of water that is desirable for a bath because of sexual  intercourse, bathing of the male and female with one vessel in the same condition and  washing of one of them with the left-over of the other.  Salama b. Abd al-Rahman narrated it on the authority of ‘Aisha that when the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took a bath, he started from the right  hand and poured water over it and washed it, and then poured water on the impurity  with the right band and washed it away with the help of the left hand and after having  removed it, he poured water on his head. ‘Aisha said: I and the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) took a bath from the same vessel, after sexual intercourse.

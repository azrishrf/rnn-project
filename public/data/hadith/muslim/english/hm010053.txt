1|53|  Chapter: He who meets his Lord with implicit faith would enter Heaven and fire would  be forbidden to harm him.  It is narrated on the authority of Anas that â€˜Itban b. Malik told him that he became blind.  He sent a message to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that he should  come and mark a place of worship for him. Thereupon came the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) and his people and then there was a discussion among them  about a man who was known as Malik b. Dukhshum, and subsequently the narrator  described the hadith of Sulaiman b. Mughira as stated above.

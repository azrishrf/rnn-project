23|4933|  Chapter: It is forbidden to prepare Nabidh is varnished jar, gourd, green pitcher, and hollow  stumps.  Sa’id b. Jubair reported: I asked Ibn ‘Umar about (the preparation of) Nabidh in a green  pitcher (besmeared with pitch), whereupon he said that Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) forbade the (preparation of) Nabidh in green pitcher (besmeared with  pitch). I then came to Ibn Abbas and said: Do you hear what Ibn ‘Umar has said?  Thereupon he said: What does he say? I said: He stated that Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) has forbidden the (preparation of) Nabidh in a green pitcher  (besmeared with pitch), whereupon he said: Ibn ‘Umar has told the truth. Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) declared unlawful the preparation of Nabidh in a  green pitcher (besmeared with pitch). I said: What is this thing, the Nabidh of a pitcher  (Nabidh prepared in a pitcher)? Thereupon, he said: Everything that is prepared in  earthen pitcher.

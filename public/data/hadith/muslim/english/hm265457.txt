26|5457|  Chapter: The excellence of curing (with the help of incantation) the influence of the evil eye and  small pustules and the poison (especially of snake and scorpion).  ‘Auf b. Malik Ashja’i reported We practised incantation in the pre-Islamic days and we  said: Allah’s Messenger, what is your opinion about it? He said: Let me know your  incantation and said: There is no harm in the incantation which does not smack of  polytheism.

1|401|  Chapter: Regarding the words of Allah: “And warn thy nearest kindred”.  It is narrated on the authority of ‘Aisha that when this verse was revealed: “And warn thy  nearest kindred,” the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood up on Safa’  and said: O Fatima, daughter of Muhammad. O Safiya, daughter of ‘Abd al-Muttalib, O  sons of ‘Abd al-Muttalib. I have nothing which can avail you against Allah; you may ask  me what you want of my worldly belongings.

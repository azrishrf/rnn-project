32|6338|  Chapter: The prohibition of pointing a weapon towards a Muslim.  Abu Huraira reported a hadith from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him); (one  of them was this) that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: None amongst  you should point a weapon towards his brother, for he does not know that Satan might  cause the weapon (to slip) from his hand and (he may injure anyone) and thus he may  fall into Hell-Fire.

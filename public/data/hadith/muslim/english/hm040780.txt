4|780|  Chapter: The reciting of Takbir at the time of bowing and rising in prayer except rising after  Ruku’ when it is said: Allah listened to him who praised Him.  ‘Ata’ reported it on the authority of Abu Huraira who said: Recitation (of Surat al-Fatiha)  in every (rak’ah) of prayer in essential. (The recitation) that we listened to from the  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) we made you listen to it. And that which he  recited inwardly to us, we recited it inwardly for you. And he who recites Umm Al- Qur’an, it is enough for him (to complete the prayer), and he who adds to it (recites  some other verses of the Holy Qur’an along with Surat al-Fatiha), it is preferable for him.

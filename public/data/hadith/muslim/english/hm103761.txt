10|3761|  Chapter: If the buyer becomes insolvent and the seller finds the commodity sold to the buyer  intact. he can take it back.  ‘Abdullah b. Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that when Khaibar had been  conquered, the Jews asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to let them  continue (cultivation in those lands) on half of the share of yield in fruits and crop,  whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I will allow you to  continue here, so long as we would desire. The rest of the hadith is the same, but with  this addition:” The fruit would be distributed equal to the half of Khaibar. And out of hall  of the produce of the land, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) got the fifth part.”

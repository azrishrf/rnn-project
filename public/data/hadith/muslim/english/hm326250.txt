32|6250|  Chapter: It is forbidden to commit oppression.  Salim reported on the authority of his father that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) said: A Muslim is the brother of a fellow-Muslim. He should neither commit  oppression upon him nor ruin him, and he who meets the need of a brother, Allah would  meet big needs, and he who relieved a Muslim from hardship Allah would relieve him  from the hardships to which he would be put on the Day of Resurrection, and he who  did not expose (the follies of a Muslim) Allah would conceal his follies on the Day of  Resurrection.

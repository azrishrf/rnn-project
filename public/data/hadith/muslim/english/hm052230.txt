5|2230|  Chapter: The reward for an honest trustee and for the woman as she gives charity from the  household of her husband. either with his explicit sanction or as it is Customary.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: A man  expressed his intention to give charity, so he came out with charity and placed it in the  hand of an adulteress. In the morning, the people were talking and saying: charity was  given to an adulteress last night. He (the giver of Sadaqa) said: O Allah, to Thee be the  praise-to an adulteress. He then again expressed his intention to give charity; so he  went out with the charity and placed it in the hand of a rich person. In the morning the  people were talking and saying: Charity was given to a rich person. He (the giver of  charity) said: O Allah, to Thee be the praise to a well to do person. He then expressed  his intention to give charity, so he went out with charity and placed it in the hand of a         thief. In the morning, the people were talking and saying: Charity was given to a thief.  So (one of the persons) said: O Allah, to Thee be the praise (what a misfortune it is that  charity has been given to) the adulteress, to a rich person, to a thief! There came (the  angel to him) and he was told: Your charity has been accepted. As for the adulteress  (the charity might become the means) whereby she might restrain herself from  fornication. The rich man might perhaps learn a lesson and spend from what Allah has  given him, and the thief might thereby refrain from committing theft.

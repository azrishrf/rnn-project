4|1075|  Chapter: Building of the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina.  Anas reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to pray towards  Bait-ul-Maqdis, that it was revealed (to him): “Indeed We see the turning of the face to  heaven, wherefore We shall assuredly cause thee to turn towards Qibla which shall  please thee. So turn thy face towards the sacred Mosque (Ka’ba)” (ii. 144). A person         from Banu Salama was going; (he found the people) in ruk’u (while) praying the dawn  prayer and they had said one rak’ah. He said in a loud voice: Listen ! the Qibla has  been changed and they turned towards (the new) Qibla (Ka’ba) in that very state.

1|144|  Chapter: Application of the word “Kufr” on one who neglects prayer.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that when, the son of Adam recites the  Ayat of Sajdah (prostration) and then falls down in prostration, the Satan goes into  seclusion and weeps and says: Alas, and in the narration of Abu Kuraib the words are:  Woe unto me, the son of Adam was commanded to prostrate, and he prostrated and         Paradise was entitled to him and I was commanded to prostrate, but I refused and am  doomed to Hell.

31|6077|  Chapter: The merits of Hassan b. Thabit (Allah be pleased with him).  Masruq reported: I visited ‘Aisha when Hassin was sitting there and reciting verses from  his compilation: She is chaste and prudent. There is no calumny against her and she  rises up early in the morning without eating the meat of the unmindful. ‘Aisha said: But  you are not so. Masruq said: I said to her: Why do you permit him to visit you, whereas  Allah has said: “And as for him among them who took upon himself the main part  thereof, he shall have a grievous punishment” (XXIV. 11)? Thereupon she said: What  torment can be more severe than this that he has become blind? He used to write satire  as a rebuttal on behalf of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

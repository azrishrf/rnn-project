31|5868|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Bakr Siddiq (Allah be pleased with him).  Anas b. Malik reported that Abu Bakr Siddiq reported him thus: I saw the feet of the  polytheists very close to us as we were in the cave. I said: Allahâ€™s Messenger, if one  amongst them were to see at his feet he would have surely seen us. Thereupon he  said: Abu Bakr, what can befall twain who have Allah as the third One with them.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

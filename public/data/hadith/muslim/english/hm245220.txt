24|5220|  Chapter: Pertaining to the discarding of rings.  Anas b. Malik reported that one day he saw on the finger of Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) a silver ring, and the people also made silver rings and put them  on. Then Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) threw his ring away, and so the  people also threw away their rings.

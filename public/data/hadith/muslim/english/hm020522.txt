2|522|  Chapter: Wiping over the socks.  Hudhaifa reported: I was with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) when he  came to the dumping ground of filth belonging to a particular tribe. He urinated while  standing, and I went aside. He (the Holy Prophet) asked me to come near him and I  went so near to him that I stood behind his heels. He then performed ablution and wiped  over his socks.

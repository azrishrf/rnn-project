1|293|  Chapter: The descent of Jesus son of Mary, and he will judge according to the Shari’ah  of our Apostle, Muhammad(may peace be upon him).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  say: A section of my people will not cease fighting for the Truth and will prevail till the  Day of Resurrection. He said: Jesus son of Mary would then descend and their  (Muslims’) commander would invite him to come and lead them in prayer, but he would  say: No, some amongst you are commanders over some (amongst you). This is the  honour from Allah for this Ummah.

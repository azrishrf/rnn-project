2|437|  Chapter: How to perform ablution.  Humran, the freed slave of ‘Uthman said: I saw Uthman call for a vessel (of water) and  poured water over his hands three times and then washed them. Then he put his right  hand in the vessel and rinsed his mouth and cleaned his nose. Then he washed his  face three times and his hands up to the elbow three times; then wiped his head, then  washed his feet three times. Then he said that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) had said: He who performed ablution like this ablution of mine and offered  two rak’ahs of prayer without allowing his thoughts to be distracted, all his previous sins  would be expiated.

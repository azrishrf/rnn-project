35|6488|  Chapter: He who loves to meet Allah, Allah also loves to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet  Allah. Allah also abhors to meet him.  ‘Aisha reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who loves to  meet Allah, Allah loves to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet Allah, Allah abhors to  meet him. I (‘Aisha) said: Allah’s Apostle, so far as the feeling of aversion against death  is concerned, we all have this feeling. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: It is not  that (which you construe), but (this) that when a believer (at the time of death) is given  the glad tidings of the mercy of Allah, His Pleasure, and of Paradise, he loves to meet  Allah, and Allah also loves to meet him, and when an unbeliever is given the news of  the torment at the Hand of Allah, and Hardship to be imposed by Him, he dislikes to  meet Allah and Allah also abhors to meet him.

10|3628|  Chapter: It is forbidden for the townsman to sell on behalf of the man of the desert.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported it directly from Allahâ€™s Apostle (may  peace be upon him): The townsman should not sell for a man from the desert (with a  view to taking advantage of his ignorance of the market conditions of the city). And  Zuhair reported from the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) that he forbade the  townsman to sell on behalf of the man from the desert.

25|5326|  Chapter: Forbiddance in calling one (other than Allah’s Apostle) with the Kunya of Abdu’l- Qasim and the fact pertaining to good names.  Mughira b. Shu’ba reported: When I came to Najran, they (the Christians of Najran)  asked me: You read “O sister of Harun” (i.e. Hadrat Maryam) in the Qur’an, whereas  Moses was born much before Jesus. When I came back to Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) I asked him about that, whereupon he said: The (people of the old  age) used to give names (to their persons) after the names of Apostles and pious  persons who had gone before them.

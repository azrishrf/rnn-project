26|5509|  Chapter: There is no infection, no evil omen, no Hama, no safar, no star promising rain,  no ghoul and the ill should not go to those who are healthy.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is  no transitive disease. Thereupon a desert Arab stood up. The rest of the hadith is the  same and in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Zuhri’ the Prophet (may peace be  upon him) is reported to have said: There is no transitive disease, no safar, no hama.

20|4473|  Chapter: The people are subservient to the Quraish and the Caliphate is the right of the  Quraish.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: People are subservient to the Quraish: the Muslims among  them being subservient to the Muslims among them, and the disbelievers among the  people being subservient to the disbelievers among them.

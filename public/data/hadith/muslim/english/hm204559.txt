20|4559|  Chapter: Instruction to stick to the main body of the Muslims in the time of trials and  warning against those inviting people to disbelief.  It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn â€˜Abbas that the messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: One who found in his Amir something which he disliked  should hold his patience, for one who separated from the main body of the Muslims  even to the extent of a hand-span and then he died would die the death of one  belonging to the days of Jahiliyya.

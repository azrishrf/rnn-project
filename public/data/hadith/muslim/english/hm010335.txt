1|335|  Chapter: The meaning of the words of Allah: “He saw Him in another descent” (Al- Qur’an 2, liii. 13).Did the Apostle (may peace be upon him) see his Lord on the night of  his journey (to Heaven) ?.  It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the words: “The heart belied not what he  saw” (al-Qur’an, liii. 11) and “Certainly he saw Him in another descent” (al-Qur’an, liii.  13) imply that he saw him twice with his heart.

4|1644|  Chapter: Forenoon prayer should be offered when it is sufficiently hot.  Ibn ‘Umar reported: A person called (the attention) of the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) as he was in the mosque, and said: Messenger of Allah, how  should I make the rak’ahs of the night prayer an odd number? Upon this the Messenger  of Allah (way peace he upon him) said: He who prays (night prayer) he should observe  it in pairs, but if he apprehends the rise of morning, he should observe one rak’ah; that  would make the number odd (for the rak’ahs) observed by him. This was narrated by  Abd Kuraib ‘Ubaidullah b. ‘Abdullah and Ibn ‘Umar did not make mention of it.

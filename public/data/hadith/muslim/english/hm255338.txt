25|5338|  Chapter: It is forbidden to call the ruler as the king of kings or Shahanshah.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The vilest  name in Allah’s sight is Malik al-Amidh (King of Kings). The narration transmitted on the  authority of Shaiba (contains these words): There is no king but Allah, the Exalted and  Glorious. Sufyan said: Similarly, the word Shahinshah (is also the vilest appellation).  Ahmad b. Hanbal said: I asked Abu ‘Amr about the meaning of Akhna. He said: The  vilest.

10|3867|  Chapter: The selling of the camel and stipulation of riding on it.  Hanash reported: We were along with Fadala b. Ubaid (Allah be pleased with him) in an  expedition.

I asked Fadala b. ‘Ubaid, whereupon he said: Separate its  gold and place it in one pan (of the balance) and place your gold in the other pan, and  do not receive but equal for equal, for I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) as saying: He who believes in Allah and the Hereafter should not take but equal for  equal.

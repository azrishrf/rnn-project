20|4706|  Chapter: About the martyrs.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira (through another chain of  transmitters) that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Whom do you  consider to be a martyr among you? They (the Companions) said: Messenger, of Allah,  one who is slain in the way of Allah is a martyr. He said: Then (if this is the definition of  a martyr) the martyrs of my Umma will be small in number. They asked: Messenger of  Allah, who are they? He said: One who is slain in the way of Allah is a martyr; one who  dies in the way of Allah, is a martyr; one who dies of plague is a martyr; one who dies of  cholera is a martyr.  Ibn Miqsam said: I testify the truth of your fatherâ€™s statement (with regard to this  tradition) that the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: One who is drowned is a  martyr.

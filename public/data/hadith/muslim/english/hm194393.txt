19|4393|  Chapter: The battle of Ta’if.  It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Amr who said: The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) besieged the people of Ta’if, but did get victory over them. He  said: God willing, we shall return. His Companions said: Shall we depart without having  conquered it? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: (All right) make a  raid in the morning. They did so. and were wounded (with the arrows showered upon  them). So the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: We shall depart  tomorrow. (The narrator says): (Now) this (announcement) pleased them, and the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed at (their waywardness).

Ibn ‘Abbas reported: (My father) Abbas sent me to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be  upon him) and he was in the house of my mother’s sister Maimuna and spent that night  along with him. He (the Holy Prophet) got up and prayed at night, and I stood up on his  left side. He caught hold of me from behind his back and made me stand on his right  side.

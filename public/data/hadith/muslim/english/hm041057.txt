4|1057|  Chapter: Prayer in a single garment.  Ibrahim b. Yazid al-Tayml reported: I used to read the Qurâ€™an with my father in the  vestibule (before the door of the mosque). When I recited the ayat (verses) concerning  prostration, he prostrated himself. I said to him: Father, do you prostrate yourself in the  path? He said: I heard Abu Dharr saying: I asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) about the mosque that was first set up on the earth. He said: Masjid  Harim. I said: Then which next? He said: The Masjid al-Aqsa. I said: How long is the  space of time between the two? He said: Forty years. He (then) further said: The earth  is a mosque for you, so wherever you are at the time of prayer, pray there.

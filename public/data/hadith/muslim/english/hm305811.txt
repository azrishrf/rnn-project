Mut’im reported on the authority of his father that he heard Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) as saying: I have many names: I am Muhammad, I am  Ahmad, I am al-Mahi through whom Allah obliterates unbelief, and I am Hashir (the  gatherer) at whose feet people will be gathered, and I am ‘Aqib (after whom there would  be none), and Allah has named him as compassionate and merciful.

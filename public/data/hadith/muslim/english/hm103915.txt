10|3915|  Chapter: Unknown.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) as saying: He who has a partner in a dwelling or a garden, it is not lawful  for him to sell that until he is permitted by his partner. If he (the partner) agrees, he  should go in for that, and if he disapproves of that, he should abandon (the idea of  selling it).

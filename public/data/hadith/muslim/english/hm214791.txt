21|4791|  Chapter: Pertaining to the flesh of the Lizard.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Abbas reported that Khalid b. Walid who is called the Sword of Allah had  informed him that he visited Maimuna, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him), in the company of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and she was the  sister of his mother (that of Khalid) and that of ‘Ibn Abbas, and he found with her a  roasted lizard which her sister Hufaida the daughter of al-Harith had brought from Najd,  and she presented that lizard to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). It was  rare that some food was presented to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and it  was not mentioned or named. While Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was  about to stretch forth his hand towards the lizard, a woman from amongst the women  present there informed the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) what they had  presented to him. They said: Messenger of Allah, it is a lizard. Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) withdrew his hand, whereupon Khalid b. Walid said: Messenger of  Allah, is a lizard forbidden? There upon he said: No, but it is not found in the land of my  people, and I feel that I have no liking for it. Khalid said: I then chewed and ate it, and  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was looking at me and he did not forbid  (me to eat it).

10|3882|  Chapter: Of salaam sale.  Nu’man b. Bashir (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) as having said this (and Nu’man) pointed towards his ears with his  fingers): What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them  are the things doubtful which many people do not know. So he who guards against  doubtful things keeps his religion and honour blameless, and he who indulges in  doubtful things indulges in fact in unlawful things, just as a shepherd who pastures his  animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it. Beware, every king has a  preserve, and the things God has declared unlawful are His preserves. Beware, in the  body there is a piece of flesh; if it is sound, the whole body is sound and if it is corrupt  the whole body is corrupt, and hearken it is the heart.

1|207|  Chapter: Suicide is the gravest sin.  It is reported on the authority of Hasan: A person belonging to the people of the past  suffered from a boil, when it pained him, he drew out an arrow from the quiver and  pierced it. And the bleeding did not stop till he died. Your Lord said: I forbade his  entrance into Paradise. Then he (Hasan) stretched his hand towards the mosque and  said: By God, Jundab transmitted this hadith to me from the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) in this very mosque.

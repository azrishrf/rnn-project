15|4041|  Chapter: He who takes an oath by Lat and Uzza’ he should say: There is no god but Allah.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who  takes an oath in the course of which he says: By Lat (and al-‘Uzza), he should say:  There is no god but Allah; and that it anyone says to his friend: “Come and I will gamble  with you,” he should pay sadaqa.

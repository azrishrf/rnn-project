1|231|  Chapter: Allah disregards the premonition of the evil promptings of the heart so long as  they do not take a firm-root.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) observed: Verily the Great and Mighty Allah forgave my people the evil  promptings arising in their minds, but they neither talked about them nor acted upon  them.

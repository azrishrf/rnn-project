23|4962|  Chapter: Every intoxicant is Khamr and every Khamr is forbidden.  Jabir reported that a person came from Jaishan, a town of Yemen, and he asked Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) about the wine which was drunk in their land and  which was prepared from millet and was called Mizr. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be         upon him) asked whether that was intoxicating. He said: Yes. Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Every intoxicant is forbidden. Verily Allah the  Exalted and Majestic, made a covenant to those who drank intoxicants to make their  drink Tinat al-Khabal. They said: Allah’s Messenger, what is Tinat a]-Khabal? He said: It  is the sweat of the denizens of Hell or the discharge of the denizens of Hell.

4|2007|  Chapter: Weeping for the dead.  Umm Salama reported: When Abu Salama died I said: I am a stranger in a strange  land; I shall weep for him in a manner that would be talked of. I made preparation for  weeping for him when a woman from the upper side of the city came there who  intended to help me (in weeping). She happened to come across the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) and he said: Do you intend to bring the devil into a  house from which Allah has twice driven him out? I (Umm Salama), therefore, refrained  from weeping and I did not weep.

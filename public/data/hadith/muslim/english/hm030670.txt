Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: When the Ka’ba was constructed the Apostle of Allah (may  peace be upon him) and Abbas went and lifted stones. Abbas said to the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him): Place your lower garment on your shoulder (so that you  may protect yourself from the roughness and hardness of stones).

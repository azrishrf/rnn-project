1|428|  Chapter: This Ummah (Ummah of Islam) would constitute half of the inhabitants of  Paradise.         ‘Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) reported: We, about forty men, were with the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) in a camp when he said: Aren’t you pleased that they should  constitute one-fourth of the inhabitants of Paradise? He (the narrator) said: Yes. He (the  Holy Prophet) again said: Aren’t you pleased that you should constitute one-third of the  inhabitants of Paradise? They said: Yes. Upon this he again said: By Him in Whose  Hand is my life, I hope that you would constitute one-half of the inhabitants of Paradise  and the reason is that no one would be admitted into Paradise but a believer and you  are no more among the polytheists than as a white hair on the skin of a black ox or a  black hair on the skin of a red ox.

20|4478|  Chapter: The people are subservient to the Quraish and the Caliphate is the right of the  Quraish.  It has been reported on the authority of Jabir b. Samura who said: I heard the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: The affairs of the people will  continue to be conducted (well) as long as they are governed by twelve men. Then the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said words which were obscure to me. I asked  my father: What did the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say? He said: All  of the (twelve men) will be from the Quraish.

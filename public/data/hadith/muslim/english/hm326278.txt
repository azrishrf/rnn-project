32|6278|  Chapter: It is forbidden to curse the beasts.  Abu Burza al-Aslami reported that a slave-girl was riding a dromedary and there was  also the luggage of people upon it, that she suddenly saw Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him). The way of the mountain was narrow and she said (to that dromedary):  Go ahead (but that dromedary did not move). She (that slave-girl), out of anger, said: O  Allah, let that (dromedary) be damned. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) said: Let the dromedary on which the curse has been invoked not proceed with us.  OF RELATIONSHIP

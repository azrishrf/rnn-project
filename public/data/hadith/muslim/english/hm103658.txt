10|3658|  Chapter: Both the buyers and the sellers have the option to withdraw the transaction  before leaving the meeting (where the bargain is struck).  Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: When two persons enter into a transaction, each of them has the  right to annul it so long as they are not separated and are together (at the place of  transaction); or if one gives the other the right (to annul the transaction) But if one gives  the other the option, the transaction is made on this condition (i.e. one has the right to         annul the transaction), it becomes binding. And if they are separated after they have  made the bargain and none of them annulled it, even then the transaction is binding.

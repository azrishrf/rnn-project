30|5816|  Chapter: The knowledge of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) about Allah and his  utmost fear of him.  ‘Aisha reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) granted permission for  doing a thing, but some persons amongst the people avoided it. This was conveyed to  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and he was so much annoyed that the sign of  his anger appeared on his face. He then said: What has happened to the people that  they avoid that for which permission has been granted to me? By Allah, I have the best  knowledge of Allah amongst them, and fear Him most amongst them.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

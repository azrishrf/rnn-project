Malik narrated it to me that he had said: Messenger of Allah, I have lost  my eyesight, and the rest of the Hadith is the same up to these words: “He led us in two  rak’ahs of prayer and we detained the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) for         serving him the pudding that we had prepared for him,” and no mention has been made  of what follows next from the addition made by Yunus and Ma’mar.

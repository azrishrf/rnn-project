43|7155|  Chapter: Not known.  Tariq b. Shihab reported that a Jew came to ‘Umar and said: Commander of the  Faithful, there is a verse in your Book, which you recite. Had it been revealed in  connection with the Jews, we would have taken it as the day of rejoicing. Thereupon he  said: Which verse do you mean? He replied: “This day I have perfected your religion for  you and I have completed My favours upon you and I have chosen al-Islam as religion  for you.” Umar said, I know the day when it was revealed and the place where it was  revealed. It was revealed to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) at ‘Arafat on  Friday.

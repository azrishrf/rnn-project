31|5924|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Ali b. Abi Talib (Allah be pleased with him).  Sahl b. Sa’d reported that a person from the offspring of Marwan was appointed as the  governor of Medina. He called Sahl b. Sa’d and ordered him to abuse All Sahl refused  to do that. He (the governor) said to him: If you do not agree to it (at least) say: May  Allah curse Abu Turab. Sahl said: There was no name dearer to All than Abu Turab (for  it was given to him by the Holy Prophet himself) and he felt delighted when he was  called by this name. He (the governor) said to him: Narrate to us the story of him being  named as Abu Turab. He said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to  the house of Fatima and he did not find ‘Ali in the house; whereupon he said: Where is  your uncle’s son? She said: (There cropped up something) between me and him which  had annoyed him with me. He went out and did not rest here. Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said to a person to find out where he was. He came and said:  Allah’s Messenger, he is sleeping in the mosque. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) came to him and found him lying in the mosque and saw that his mantle had  slipped from his back and his back was covered with dust and Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) began to wipe it away from him (from the body of Hadrat ‘Ali)  saying: Get up, covered with dust; get up, covered with dust.             HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

6|2641|  Chapter: When should a person enter the place of I’tikaf as he intends to observe it.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that when the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) decided to observe i’tikaf, he prayed in the morning and then went  to the place of his i’tikaf, and he commanded that a tent should be pitched for him, and it  was pitched. He (once) decided to observe i’tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan.  Zainab (the wife of the Holy Prophet) commanded that a tent should be pitched for her.  It was pitched accordingly. And some other wives of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) commanded that tents should be pitched for them too. And they were  pitched. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) offered the morning  prayer, he looked and found (so many) tents. Thereupon he said: What is this virtue that  these (ladies) have decided to acquire? He commanded his tent to be struck and  abandoned i’tikaf in the month of Ramadan and postponed it to the first ten days of  Shawwal.

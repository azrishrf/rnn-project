24|5235|  Chapter: Command concerning the wrapping up of a garment completely leaving no  opening for the arms and sitting with single garment wrapped around one’s knees.  Jabir reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When the thong  of the shoe of any one of you is cut off, he should not walk with one sandal until he has  got the thong repaired, and he should not walk with one shoe and he should not eat with  his left hand and should not wrap his cloth round his knees or wrap himself completely  leaving no room for the arms.

1|226|  Chapter: The veracity of Faith and its sincerity.  It is narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) that when this verse was  revealed: “It is those who believe and confound not their belief with wrongdoing” (vi. 82),  the Companions of the Messenger of Allah wore greatly perturbed. They said: Who  amongst us (is so fortunate) that he does not wrong himself? Upon this the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: It does not mean that which you presume  It implies that which Luqman said to his son: O my son, do not associate anything with  Allah, for indeed it is the gravest wrongdoing (xxxi. 13).

23|4955|  Chapter: It is forbidden to prepare Nabidh is varnished jar, gourd, green pitcher, and hollow  stumps.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr reported that when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  forbade (the preparation) of Nabidh in vessels, they said all the people cannot (afford to  have) them. He (the Holy Prophet) then granted them permission (to prepare) Nabidh in  a green pitcher, but not in those besmeared with pitch.

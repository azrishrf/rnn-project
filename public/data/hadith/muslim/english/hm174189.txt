17|4189|  Chapter: Prohibition of intercession regarding prescribed punishment for theft and other  (crimes) in case of important persons.  ‘Aisha reported that a woman from the tribe of Makhzum used to borrow things (from  people) and then denied (having taken them). Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  commanded her hand to be cut off. Her relatives came to Usama b. Zaid and spoke to  him (requesting him to intercede on her behalf). He spoke to Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) about her. The rest of the hadith is the same.

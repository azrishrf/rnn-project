7|2844|  Chapter: Ifrad and Qiran (combining Hajj and Umra in one Ihram) in the performance of  pilgrimage.         Anas (Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard Allah’s Apostle (way peace be upon him)  pronouncing Talbiya for both Hajj and Umra. Bakr (one of the narrators) said: I narrated  it to Ibn ‘Umar, whereupon he said: He (the Holy Prophet) pronounced the Talbiya for  Hajj alone. I met Anas and narrated to him the words of Ibn ‘Umar, whereupon he said:  You treat us not but only as children. I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) pronouncing Talbiya both for ‘Umra and Hajj.

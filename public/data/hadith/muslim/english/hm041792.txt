4|1792|  Chapter: “The Qur’an has been revealed in seven modes of “reading” and its meaning.  Abu Wa’il reported: A person came to ‘Abdullah, who was called Nahik b. Sinan, and  the rest of the Hadith is the same but for this: ” Alqama came to him (‘Abdullah b.  Mas’ud) and we said to him: Ask him about the manners in which he combined (two  surahs) in one rak’ah. So he went to him and asked him and then came to us and said:  Twenty are the mufassal surahs in the compilation (of the Qur’an) made by ‘Abdullah.”

26|5458|  Chapter: Permissibility of getting reward for incantations from the words of the Qur’an.  Abu Sa’id Khudri reported that some persons amongst the Companions of Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out on a journey and they happened to pass  by a tribe from the tribes of Arabia. They demanded hospitality from the members of  that tribe, but they did not extend any hospitality to them. They said to them: Is there  any incantator amongst you, at the chief of the tribe has been stung by a scorpion? A  person amongst us said: ‘Yes. So he came to him and he practised incantation with the  help of Sura al-Fatiha and the person became all right. He was given a flock of sheep  (as recompense), but he refused to accept that, saying: I shall make a mention of it to  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and if he approves of it, then I shall accept it.  So we came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to  him and he (that person) said: Allah’s Messenger by Allah, I did not practice incantation  but with the help of Sura al-Fatiha of the Holy Book. He (the Holy Prophet) smiled and  said: How did you come to know that it can be used (as incantation)? and then said:  Take out of that and allocate a share for me along with your share.

4|1680|  Chapter: Encouragement to observe prayers during Ramadhan and that is Tarawih.  Kuraib reported that Ibn ‘Abbas spent a night in the house of the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) and he said: The Messenger of Allah may peace be upon  him) stood near the water-skin and poured water out of that and performed ablution in  which he neither used excess of water nor too little of it, and the rest of the Hadith is the  same, and in this mention is also made (of the fact) that on that night the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) made supplication before Allah in nineteen words.  Kuraib reported: I remember twelve words out of these, but have forgotten the rest. The  Messenger of Allah said: “Place light in my heart, light in my tongue, light in my hearing,  light in my sight, light above me, light below me, light on my right, light on my left, light in  front of me, light behind me, place light in my soul, and make light abundant for me.”

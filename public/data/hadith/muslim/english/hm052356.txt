5|2356|  Chapter: Accepting of gift by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and refusing the  Sadaqa.         Umm 窶連tiyya, said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent me some  mutton of sadaqa. I sent a piece out of that to 窶連isha. When the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) came to 窶連isha, he said: Have you anything with you (to eat)?  She said: Nothing, except only that mutton sent to us by Nusaiba (the kunya of Umm  窶連tiyya) which you had sent to her. Whereupon he said: It has reached its proper place.

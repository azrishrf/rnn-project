Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: The riders (carrying merchandise) should not be met in the way,  and townsman should not sell for a man of the desert. The narrator reported. I said to  Ibn ‘Abbas: What do these words really imply “The townsman for the man of the  desert”? He said: That he should work as a broker on his behalf.

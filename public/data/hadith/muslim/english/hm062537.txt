6|2537|  Chapter: Forbiddance to observe fast on ‘Id-ul-Fitr and ‘Id-al-Adha.  Ziyad b. Jubair reported that a person came to Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them)  and said: I had taken a vow that I would fast on the day (but it accidentally)  synchronises with the day of Adha or the day of Fitr. Thereupon Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be  pleased with him) said: Allah, the Exalted, has commanded fulfilling of the vow, but the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has forbidden the observance of fast on  this day.

1|88|  Chapter: Precedence of the believers over one another and the superiority of the  people of Yemen in this respect.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  and blessings be upon him) observed: The belief is among the Yemenites, and the  unbelief is towards the East, and tranquillity is among those who rear goats and sheep,  and pride and simulation is among the uncivil and rude owners of horses and camels.

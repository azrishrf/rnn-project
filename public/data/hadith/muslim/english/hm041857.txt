4|1857|  Chapter: There is a special (fortunate) time on Friday.  Abu Huraira reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: The best  day on which the sun has risen is Friday; on it Adam was created on it he was made to         enter Paradise, on it he was expelled from it. And the last hour will take place on no day  other than Friday.

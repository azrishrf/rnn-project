31|5990|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her).  ‘Aisha, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), reported that he used to  say: Never a prophet dies in a state that he is not made to see his abode in Paradise,  and then given a choice. ‘Aisha said that when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) was about to leave the world, his head was over her thigh and he had fallen into  swoon three times. When he felt relief his eyes were fixed at the ceiling. He then said: O  Allah, along with the high companions (i.e. along with the Apostles who live in the most  elevated place of the Paradise). (On hearing these words), I then said (to myself) He is  not going to opt us and I remembered a hadith which he had narrated to us as he was  healthy and in which he said: No prophet dies until he sees his abode in Paradise, he is  then given a choice. ‘Aisha said: These were the last words which Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) spoke (the words are): O Allah, with companions on High.             HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

7|3012|  Chapter: Excellence of making a halt at al Muha’ab, on the day of Nahr, and observing  prayer there.  Abu Rafi’ reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not command me  to observe halt at al-Abtah when he departed from Mina, but I came and set up his (the  Holy Prophet’s) tent (of my own accord); and he (Allah’s Apostle) came and observed  halt. This Hadith is narrated through another chain of transmitters from Abu Rafi’ who  was (in charge) of the luggage of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).

31|6056|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Ibn ‘Umar reported: I saw in a state of sleep as if I have in my hand a piece of silk cloth  and there is no place in the Paradise where I intend to reach but that piece of cloth does  not fly towards it. I made a mention of it to Hafsa (the sister of Ibn ‘Umar) and Hafsa  made a mention of it to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: I find ‘Abdullah b ‘Umar a pious person.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

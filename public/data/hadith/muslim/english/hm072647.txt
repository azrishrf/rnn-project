7|2647|  Chapter: What is permitted for the Muhrim (wearer of Ihram) in Hajj and Umra, what is  not permissible and forbiddance of the use of perfume.  Ibn â€˜Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that a person asked the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) what a Muhrim should put on as dress. Thereupon the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do not put on a shirt or a turban, or  trousers or a cap, or leather stockings except one who does not find shoes; he may put  on stockings but he should trim them below the ankles. And do not wear clothes to  which saffron or wars is applied.

4|2098|  Chapter: Standing up on seeing a bier.  It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Abu Laila that while Qais b. Sa’d and Sahl b. Hunaif  were both in Qadislyya a bier passed by them and they both stood up. They were told  that it was the bier of one of the people of the land (non-Muslim). They said that a bier  passed before the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and he stood up. He was told  that he (the dead man) was a Jew. Upon this he remarked: Was he not a human being  or did he not have a soul? And in the Hadith narrated by ‘Amr b. Murra with the same  chain of transmitters, (the words) are: “There passed a bier before us.”

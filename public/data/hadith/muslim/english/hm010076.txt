1|76|  Chapter: Concerning exhortation to accord honour and respect to the neighbour and  the guest and obligation to observe silence except in goodness, and all these qualities  come within the orbit of Iman.  It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  and blessings be upon him) observed: He who believes in Allah and the Last Day does  not harm is neighbour, and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day shows hospitality  to his guest and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day speaks good or remains  silent.

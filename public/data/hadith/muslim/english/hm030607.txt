3|607|  Chapter: Bathing is obligatory for a woman after experiencing orgasm in dream.  Anas b. Malik reported: Umm Sulaim who was the grandmother of Ishaq came to the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the presence of ‘Aisha and said to him:  Messenger of Allah, in case or woman sees what a man sees in dream and she  experiences in dream what a man experiences (i.e. experiences orgasm)? Upon this  ‘Aisha remarked: O Umm Sulaim, you brought humiliation to women; may your right  hand be covered with dust. He (the Holy Prophet) said to ‘Aisha: Let your hand be  covered with dust, and (addressing Umm Sulaim) said: Well, O Umm Sulaim, she  should take a bath if she sees that (i.e. she experiences orgasm in dream).

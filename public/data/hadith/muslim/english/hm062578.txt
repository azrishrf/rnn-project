6|2578|  Chapter: The fasts observed by the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) besides  Ramadhan.  Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported. I asked â€˜Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) about fasting of  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: He used to observe fast (at  times) so continuously that we said: He has fasted, he has fasted. And (at times) he did  not observe fast (for days) and we began to say: He has abandoned fasting, he has  abandoned fasting. She said: I did not see him observing fast throughout the whole of  the month since he arrived in Medina, but that of Ramadan.

5|2186|  Chapter: Getting of reward to Sadaqa for the dead given on his or her behalf.  Anas reported that when this verse was revealed: “You will not attain righteousness till  you give freely of what you love,” Abu Talha said: I see that our Lord has demanded  from us out of our property; so I make you a witness, Messenger of Allah, that I give my  land known as Bairaha’ for the sake of Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: Give that to your relatives. So he gave it to Hassan b. Thabit  and Ubayy b. Ka’b.

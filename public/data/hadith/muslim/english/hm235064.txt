23|5064|  Chapter: Permissibility of a person’s taking anyone along with him where the host is very  intimate with the guest.  Anas b. Malik reported: Abu Talha saw Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  lying down upon his belly in the mosque. He came to Umm Sulaim and said: I saw  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) lying down upon the belly in the mosque,  and I think he is hungry. The rest of the hadith is the same (but with the addition of  these words) that Allah’s messenger (may peace be upon him) ate (the food) and so did  Abu Talha, Umm Sulaim and Anas b. Malik, but there was left something which we  presented to our neighbours.

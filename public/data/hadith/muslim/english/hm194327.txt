19|4327|  Chapter: The spoils of war specially made lawful for this Umma.  It has been narrated by Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) said: One of the Prophets made a holy war. He said to his followers: One who has  married a woman and wants to consummate to his marriage but has not yet done so;  another who has built a house but has not yet erected its roof; and another who has  bought goats and pregnant she-camels and is waiting for their offspring-will not  accompany me. So he marched on and approached a village at or about the time of the  â€˜Asr prayers. He said to the sun: Thou art subservient (to Allah) and so am I. O Allah,  stop it for me a little. It was stopped for him until Allah granted him victory. The people  gathered the spoils of war (at one place). A fire approached the spoils to devour them,  but it did not devour them. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Some of you have been guilty of  misappropriation. So one man from each tribe should swear fealty to me. The did so  (putting their hands into his). The hand of one man stuck to his hand and the Prophet  (may peace be upon him) said: Your tribe is guilty of misappropriation. Let all the  members of your tribe swear fealty to me one by one. They did so, when the hands of  two or three persons got stuck with his hand. He said: You have misappropriated. So  they took out gold equal in volume to the head of a cow. They-placed it among the  spoils on the earth. Then the fire approached the spoils and devoured them. The spoils  of war were not made lawful for any people before us, This is because Allah saw our  weakness and humility and made them lawful for us.

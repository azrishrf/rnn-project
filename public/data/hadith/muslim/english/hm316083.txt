31|6083|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Huraira Al-Dawsi Al-Yamani (Allah be pleased with him).  Al-A’raj reported that he heard Abu Huraira as saying: You are under the impression  that Abu Huraira transmits so many ahadith from Allah’s Messenger (may peace up  upon him); (bear in mind) Allah is the great Reckoner. I was a poor man and I served  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) being satisfied with bare subsistence,  whereas the immigrants remained busy with transactions in the bazar; while the Ansar  had been engaged in looking after their properties. (He further reported) that Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who spreads the cloth would not forget  anything that he would hear from me. I spread my cloth until he narrated something. I  then pressed it against my (chest), so I never forgot anything that I heard from him.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

20|4673|  Chapter: The wives of Mujahids, a sacred trust, and sinfulness of those who betray this  trust.  It has been narrated on the authority of Sulaimin b. Buraida who learnt the tradition from  his father. The latter said that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  The sanctity of the wives of Mujahids is like the sanctity of their mothers for those who         sit at home (i.e. do not go out for Jihad). Anyone who stays behind looking after the  family of a Mujahid and betrays his trust will be made to stand on the Day of judgment  before the Mujahid who will take away from his meritorious deeds whatever he likes. So  what do you think (will he leave anything)?

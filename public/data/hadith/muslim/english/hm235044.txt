23|5044|  Chapter: The merit of licking the fingers after taking food and wiping the dish (with fingers) and  eating of the fallen mouthful after removing the dirt sticking to it.  Jabir reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When any one of  you drops a mouthful he should pick it up and remove any of the filth on it, and then eat  it, and should not leave it for the Satan, and should not wipe his hand with towel until he  has licked his fingers, for he does not know in what portion of the food the blessing lies.

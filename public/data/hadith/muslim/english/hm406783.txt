40|6783|  Chapter: Not known.  Sahl b. Sa’d as-Sa’idi reported: I was in the company of Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) that he gave a description of Paradise and then Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) concluded with these words: There would be bounties which the  eye has not seen and the ear has not heard and no human heart has ever perceived  them. He then recited this verse: “They forsake (their) beds, calling upon their Lord in  fear and in hope, and spend out of what We have given them. So no soul knows what  refreshment of the eyes is hidden for them: a reward for what they did” (xxxii. 16-17)  INTIMATES

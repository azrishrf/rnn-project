17|4237|  Chapter: Imposition of Hadd obliterates sins.  ‘Ubida b. as-Samit reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took (a  pledge) from us as he took from the women that we will not associate anything with  Allah and we will not steal, and we will not commit adultery, and we will not kill our  children, and we will not bring calumny upon one another. And he who amongst you  fulfils (this pledge), his reward rests with Allah, and he upon whom amongst you is  imposed the prescribed punishment and that is carried out, that is his expiation (for that  sin), and he whose (sins) were covered by Allah, his matter rests with Allah. He may  punish him if He likes or may forgive him if He so likes.

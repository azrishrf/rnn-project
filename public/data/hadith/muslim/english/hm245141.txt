Khattab saw (some one selling) the garments of silk at  the door of the mosque, whereupon he said: Allah’s Messenger, would that you buy it  and wear it for the people on Friday and for (receiving) the delegations when they come  to you? Upon this. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: go who wears it  has no share (of reward) in the Hereafter. Then these garments were sent to Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he presented one of these silk garment to  Umar. Thereupon Umar said: You make me wear (this silk garment) Whereas you said  about the silk garment of Utarid (the person who had been busy selling this garment at  the door of the mosque) what you had to say, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: I have not presented you this for wearing it (but to make use  of its price) ; so ‘Umar presented it to his polytheist brother in Mecca.

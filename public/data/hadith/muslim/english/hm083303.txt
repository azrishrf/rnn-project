8|3303|  Chapter: Seeking consent of al-Thayyib in marriage in words and of a virgin in (meaningful)  silence.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) as having said: A woman without a husband (or divorced or a widow) must  not be married until she is consulted, and a virgin must not be married until her  permission is sought. They asked the Prophet of Allah (May peace be upon him): How  her (virgin’s) consent can be solicited? He (the Holy Prophet) said: That she keeps  silence.

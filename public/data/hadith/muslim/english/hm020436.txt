2|436|  Chapter: How to perform ablution.  Humran, the freed slave of ‘Uthman, said: Uthman b. ‘Affan called for ablution water and  this is how he performed the ablution. He washed his hands thrice. He then rinsed his  mouth and cleaned his nose with water (three times). He then washed his face three  times, then washed his right arm up to the elbow three times, then washed his left arm  like that, then wiped his head; then washed his right foot up to the ankle three times,  then washed his left foot like that, and then said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) perform ablution like this ablution of mine. Then the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who performs ablution like this ablution of mine  and then stood up (for prayer) and offered two rak’ahs of prayer without allowing his  thoughts to be distracted, all his previous sins are expiated. Ibn Shihab said: Our  scholars remarked: This is the most complete of the ablutions performed for prayer.

4|2011|  Chapter: Visiting the sick.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar reported: While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him), a person, one of the Ansar, came to him and greeted him. The  Ansari then turned back. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  said: o brother of Ansar, how is my brother Sa’d be ‘Ubada? He said: He is better. The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who amongst you would visit him?  He (the Holy Prophet) stood up and we also got up along with him, and we were more  than ten persons. We had neither shoes with us, nor socks, nor caps, nor shirts. We  walked on the barren land till we came to him. The people around him kept away till the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Companions with him came near  him (Sa’d b. ‘Ubada).

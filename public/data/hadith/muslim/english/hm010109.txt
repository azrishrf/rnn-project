1|109|  Chapter: Concerning diminution of Belief due to sins and its separation from the sinner;  negation of the excellence of Islam at the time of committing sin.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira: A fornicator who fornicates is not a  believer as long as he commits fornication, and no one who steals is a believer as long  as he commits theft, and no one who drinks wine is a believer as long as he drinks it,  and repentance may be accepted after that.

37|6631|  Chapter: The mercy of Allah predominates his wrath.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There are  one hundred (parts of) mercy for Allah and He has sent down out of these one part of  mercy upon the jinn and human beings and the insects and it is because of this (one  part) that they love one another, show kindness to one another and even the beast  treats its young one with affection, and Allah has reserved ninety-nine parts of mercy  with which He would treat His servants on the Day of Resurrection.

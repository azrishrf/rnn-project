7|2659|  Chapter: The place where the pilgrims enter upon the state of Ihram.  Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) specified Dhu’l-Hulaifa, for the people of Medina; Juhfa for the  people of Syria; Qarn al-Manazil, for the people of Najd; Yalamlam for the people of  Yemen (the Mawaqit) and those (Mawaqit) are also meant for those who live at these  (places) and for those too who come from without towards them for the sake of Hajj or  ‘Umra. And those who live within them (within the bounds of these places) or in the  suburbs of Mecca or within Mecca, they should enter upon the state of Ihram at these  very places.

9|3557|  Chapter: Li’an (Invoking curse).  Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) saying to the invokers of curse: Your account is with Allah. One of you must be a  liar. You have now no right over this woman. He said: Messenger of Allah, what about  my wealth (dower that I paid her at the time of marriage)? He said: You have no claim to  wealth. If you tell the truth, it (dower) is the recompense for your having had the right to  intercourse with her, and if you tell a lie against her, it is still more remote from you than  she is. Zuhair said in his narration: Sufyan reported to us on the authority of ‘Amr that  he had heard Sa’id b Jubair saying: I heard Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them)  saying that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said it.

1|260|  Chapter: Concerning the fact that violable is the blood of one who makes an attempt to  take possession of the property of another without any legitimate right. If such a man is  killed his abode is Fire and he who dies in protecting his property is a martyr.  It is narrated on the authority of Thabit, that when ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr and ‘Anbasa b. Abi  Sufyan were about to fight against each other, Khalid b. ‘As rode to ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr  and persuaded him (not to do so). Upon this Abdullah b. ‘Amr said: Are you not aware  that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had observed: “He who died in  protecting his property is a martyr.”  This hadith has been narrated by Muhammad b. Hatim, Muhammad b. Bakr, Ahmad b.  ‘Uthman Naufali, Abu ‘Asim, Ibn Juraij.

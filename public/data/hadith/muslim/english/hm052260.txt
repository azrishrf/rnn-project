5|2260|  Chapter: Miskin (poor man) is one who does not find enough to satisfy him and the people do  not consider him(needy) as to give him charity.  Abd Al-Rahman b. Auf reported: I heard Muâ€™awiya b. Abu Sufyan saying in an address  that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: He to  whom Allah intends to do good, He gives him insight into religion. And I am only the  distributor while Allah is the Bestower.

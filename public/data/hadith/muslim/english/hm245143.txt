24|5143|  Chapter: The use of gold and silver vessels to forbidden to men and women and it is  also prohibited to drink in them.  Ibn Umar reported that Umar saw Utarid al-Tamimi standing in the market (and selling)  the silk garments, and he was the person who went to (courts of) kings and got (high  prices) for these garments from them. Umar said: Allah’s Messenger I saw ‘Utarid  standing in the market with a silk garment; would that you buy and wear it for (receiving)  the delegations of Arabs when they visit you? I (the narrator) said: I think he (‘Umar)  also said: You may wear it on Friday (also). Thereupon, Allah’s Messenger (may peace         he upon him) said: He who wears silk in this world has no share in the Hereafter. Later  on when these silk garments were presented to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) he presented one silk garment to ‘Umar and presented one also to Usama b. Zaid  and gave one to ‘Ali b. Abu ‘Talib, saying: Tear them and make head coverings for your  ladies. ‘Umar came carrying his garment and said: Allah’s Messenger, you have sent it  to me, whereas you had said yesterday about the (silk)garment of Utarid what you had  to say. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have not sent it to you that you wear it, but I have  sent It to you so that you may derive benefit out of it; and Usama (donned) the garment  (presented to him) and appeared to be brisk, whereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) looked at him with a look by which he perceived that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) did not like what he had done. He said: Allah’s Messenger,  why is it that you look at me like this, whereas you yourself presented it to me? He said:  I never sent it to you to wear it, but I sent It to you so that you may tear it and make out  head covering for your ladies.

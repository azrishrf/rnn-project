31|5881|  Chapter: The merits of Abu Bakr Siddiq (Allah be pleased with him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A person  had been driving an ox loaded with luggage. The ox looked towards him and said: I  have not been created for this but for lands (i.e. for ploughing the land and for drawing  out water from the wells for the purpose of irrigating the lands). The people said with  surprise and awe: Hallowed be Allah, does the ox speak? Allah’s Messenger (may         peace be upon him) said: I believe it and so do Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. Abu Huraira  reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A shepherd was  tending the flock when a wolf came there and took away one goat. Tile shepherd  pursued it (the wolf) and rescued it (the goat) from that (wolf). The wolf looked towards  him and said: Who would save it on the day when there will be no shepherd except me?  Thereupon people said: Hallowed be Allah I Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) said: I believe in it and so do Abu Bakr and Umar believe.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

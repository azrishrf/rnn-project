31|6058|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Ibn Umar reported: I used to spend nights in the mosque and by that time I had no wife  and children. I saw in a dream as if I am being taken to a well. I made a mention of it to  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). The rest of the hadith is the same.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

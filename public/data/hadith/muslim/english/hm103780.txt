10|3780|  Chapter: Prohibition of the sale of excess water in the barren lands, and preventing people to  use it, and hiring a camel to cover a she-camel.  Abdullah b. Ka’ab b. Malik reported from his father that he pressed in the mosque Ibn  Abu Hadrad for the payment of the debt that he owed to him during the lifetime of  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). (In this altercation) their voices became  loud, until Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) heard them, while he was in the  house, so Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came out towards them, and he  lifted the curtain of his apartment and he called upon Ka’b b. Malik and said: O Ka’b. He  said: At thy beck and call, Allah’s Messenger. He pointed out with the help of his hand  to remit half of the loan due to him. Ka’b said: Allah’s Messenger, I am ready to do that,  whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (to Ibn Abu Hadrad):  Stand up and make him the payment (of the rest).

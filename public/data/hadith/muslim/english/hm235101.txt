23|5101|  Chapter: Showing honour to the guest and the merit of making of sacrifice for him.  Abu Huraira reported that a guest spent the night with a person from the Ansar who had  nothing with him but food (sufficient) for his own self and his children. He said to his  wife: (Lull) the children to sleep, and put out the lamp, and serve the guest with what  you have with you. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed: “Those who  prefer the needy to their own selves in spite of the fact that they are themselves in  pressing need” (lix. 9).

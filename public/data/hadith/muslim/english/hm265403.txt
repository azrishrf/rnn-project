26|5403|  Chapter: It is prohibited to sit with a strange lady in privacy or to enter her house when she is  alone.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr. b. al-‘As reported that some persons from Banu Hisham entered the  house of Asma’ daughter of ‘Umais when Abu Bakr also entered (and she was at that  time his wife). He (Abu Bakr) saw it and disapproved of it and he made a mention of that  to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: I did not see but good only (in  my wife). Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Verily Allah has  made her immune from all this. Then Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  stood on the pulpit and said: After this day no man should enter the house of another  person in his absence, but only when he is accompanied by one person or two persons.

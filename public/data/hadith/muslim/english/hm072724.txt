7|2724|  Chapter: Which animal the Muhrim and the non-Muhrim are permitted to kill in the state  of Ihram at the conclusion of it (within the precincts of the Ka’ba).  Salim reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with them) that the  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Five are the (beasts) which if one kills  them in the precincts of the Ka’ba or in the state of ihram entail no sin: rat, scorpion,  crow, kite and voracious dog. In another version the words are: “as a Muhrim and in the  state of ihram”.

21|4799|  Chapter: Pertaining to the flesh of the Lizard.  Abu Sa’id reported that a person said: Messenger of Allah, we live in a land abounding  in lizards, so what do you command or what verdict you give (about eating of it)?  Thereupon he said: It was mentioned to me that a people from among Bani Isra’il were  distorted (so there is a likelihood that those people might have been distorted in the  shape of lizards). So he neither commanded (us to eat that) nor forbade (us). Abu Sa’id  said: After some time Umar said: Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, has made it (a source  of) benefit for more than one (person), for it is the common diet of shepherds. Had it  been with me, I would have eaten that. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  disliked it.

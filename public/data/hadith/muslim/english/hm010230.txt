1|230|  Chapter: Allah disregards the premonition of the evil promptings of the heart so long as  they do not take a firm-root.         It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) observed: Verily Allah forgave my people the evil promptings which arise  within their hearts as long as they did not speak about them or did not act upon them.

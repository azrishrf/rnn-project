37|6618|  Chapter: Exhortation for repentance.  Anas b. Malik reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah is  more pleased with the repentance of a servant as he turns towards Him for repentance  than this that one amongst you is upon the camel in a waterless desert and there is  upon (that camel) his provision of food and drink also and it is lost by him, and he  having lost all hope (to get that) lies down in the shadow and is disappointed about his  camel and there he finds that camel standing before him. He takes hold of his nose- string and then out of boundless joy says: O Lord, Thou art my servant and I am Thine  Lord. He commits this mistake out of extreme delight.

1|307|  Chapter: The beginning of Revelation to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him).  Yahya reported: I asked Abu Salama what was revealed first from the Qur’an. He said:”  O, the shrouded one.” I said: Or “Recite.” Jabir said: I am narrating to you what was  narrated to us by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: I stayed in  Hira’ for one month and when my stay was completed, I come down and went into the  heart of the valley. Somebody called me aloud. I looked in front of me, behind me, on  the right of my side and on my left, but I did not see any body. I was again called and I  looked about but saw nothing. I was called again and raised my head, and there on the  Throne in the open atmosphere he, i.e. Gabriel (peace be upon him) was sitting. I  began to tremble on account of fear. I came to Khadija and said: Wrap me up. They  wrapped me up and threw water on me and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, sent down  this: you who are shrouded! arise and deliver warning, your Lord magnify, your clothes  cleanse.”

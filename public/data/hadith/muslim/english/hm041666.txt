4|1666|  Chapter: Exhortation to supplicate and make mention (of Allah) at the end of the night and its  acceptance by the Lord.  â€˜Aisha reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) prayed one night  in the mosque and people also prayed along with him. He then prayed on the following  night and there were many persons. Then on the third or fourth night (many people)  gathered there, but the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not come out  to them (for leading the Tarawih prayer). When it was morning he said: I saw what you  were doing, but I desisted to come to you (and lead the prayer) for I feared that this  prayer might become obligatory for you. (He the narrator) said: It was the month of  Ramadan.

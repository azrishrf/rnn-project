1|67|  Chapter: Concerning the attributes by which one gets the relish of Iman.         It is reported on the authority of Anas that the Prophet of Allah (may peace and  blessings be upon him) said: There are three qualities for which anyone who is  characterised by them will relish the sweetness of faith: he to whom Allah and His  Messenger are dearer than all else; he who loves a man for Allahâ€™s sake alone; and he  who has as great an abhorrence of returning to unbelief after Allah has rescued him  from it as he has of being cast into Hell.

30|5729|  Chapter: It is very seldom that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said ‘No” to anyone  when asked to give anything, and he gave charity to the people very freely.  Anas ‘b. Malik reported that a person requested Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) to give him a very large flock and he gave that to him. He came to his tribe and  said: O people, embrace Islam. By Allah, Muhammad donates so much as if he did not  fear want. Anas said that the person embraced Islam for the sake of the world but later         he became Muslim until Islam became dearer to him than the world and what it  contains.

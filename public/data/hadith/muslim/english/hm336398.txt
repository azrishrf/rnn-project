33|6398|  Chapter: The growth of a child in the womb of a mother and his destiny in regard to his  livelihood, his deeds. both good and evil.  All reported: We were in a funeral in the graveyard of Gharqad that Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) came to us and we sat around him. He had a stick with him.  He lowered his head and began to scratch the earth with his stick, and then raid: There  is not one amongst you whom a scat in Paradise or Hell has not been allotted and about  whom it has not been written down whether he would be an evil person or a blessed  person. A person said: Allah’s Messenger, should we not then depend upon our destiny  and abandon our deeds? Thereupon he said: Acts of everyone will be facilitated in, that  which has been created for him so that whoever belongs to the company of the blessed  will have good works made easier for him and whoever belongs to the unfortunate ones  will have evil acts made easier for him. He then recited this verse (from the Qur’an):  “Then, who gives to the needy and guards against evil and accepts the excellent (the         truth of Islam and the path of righteousness it prescribes), We shall make easy for him  the easy end and who is miserly and considers himself above need, We shall make  easy for him the difficult end”. (xcii. 5-10).

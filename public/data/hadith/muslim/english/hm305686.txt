30|5686|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  Umm Salama, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), said I used to hear from  people making a mention of the Cistern, but I did not hear about it from Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him). One day while a girl was combing me I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) say: “O people.” I said to that girl: Keep away from me. She said: He (the Holy  Prophet) has addressed the men only and he has not invited the attention of the women. I said: I  am  amongst  the  people  also  (and  have  thus  every  right  to  listen  to  the  things  pertaining  to  religion). Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I shall be your harbinger on the  Cistern; therefore, be cautious lest one of you should come (to me) and may be driven away like  a stray camel. I would ask the reasons, and it would be said to me: You don’t know what  innovations they made after you. And I would then also say: Be away.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

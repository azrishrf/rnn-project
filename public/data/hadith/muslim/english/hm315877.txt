Ibn Abu Mulaika reported: I heard ‘Aisha as saying and she was asked as to whom  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would have nominated his successor if he  had to nominate one at all. She said: Abu Bakr. It was said to her: Then whom after Abu  Bakr? She said: Umar. It was said to her. Then whom after ‘Umar? She said: Abu  Ubaida b. Jarrab, and then she kept quiet at this.

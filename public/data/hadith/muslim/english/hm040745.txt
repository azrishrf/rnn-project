4|745|  Chapter: There can be two pronouncers of Adhan for one mosque.  Anas b. Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to  attack the enemy when it was dawn. He would listen to the Adhan; so if he heard an  Adhan, he stopped, otherwise made an attack. Once on hearing a man say: Allah is the  Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  remarked: He is following al-Fitra (al-Islam). Then hearing him say: I testify that there is  no god but Allah. there is no god but Allah, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) said: You have come out of the Fire (of Hell). They looked at him and found that he  was a goatherd.

7|2882|  Chapter: Concerning the Umras performed by Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) and their respective times.  ‘Ataa reported that ‘Urwa b. Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) had informed him (this): I  and Ibn ‘Umar were reclining against the (wall) of the apartment of ‘Aisha and we were  listening to the sound produced by the brushing of her teeth. I said Abu Abd al-Rahman  (the kunya of ‘Abdullah b. Umar), did Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) perform  ‘Umra in the month of Rijab? He said: Yes. I said to ‘Aisha: Mother, are you listening to  what Abu Abd al-Rabman is saying? She said: What is he Saying? I said: He is saying  that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) performed ‘Umra during the month of  Rajab, whereupon she said: May Allah grant pardon to Abu Abd al-Rahman I By my life  he (the Holy Prophet) did not perform ‘Umra during the month of Rajab. And never was         there an Umra performed by him (the Holy Prophet) in which he (‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar) did  not join him. Ibn ‘Umar heard this and said nothing to affirm It or to deny it, but kept  quiet.

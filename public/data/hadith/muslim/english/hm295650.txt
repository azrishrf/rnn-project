29|5650|  Chapter: The vision of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  Ibn Abbas reported that Musailima al-Kadhdhab (the greater liar) (who claimed  prophethood after the death of the Holy Prophet) came during the lifetime of Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) to Medina and said: If Muhammad assigns his  caliphate to me after him I would follow, and there came along with him a large body of  persons of his tribe and there came to him Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  along with Thabit b. Qais b. Shammas and the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon  him) had a piece of wood in his hand until he came in front of Musailima in the company  of his companions and said: If you were to ask even this (wood), I would never give it to  you. I am not going to do anything against the will of God in your case, and if you turn  away (from what I say) Allah will destroy you. And I find you in the same state which I  was shown (in the dream) and here is Thabit and he would answer you on my behalf.  He (the Holy Prophet) then went back. Ibn ‘Abbas said: I asked the (meanings of the)  words of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him): “You are the same what I was made  to see about you in my dream.” and Abu Huraira reported that Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: While I was sleeping I saw in my hands two gold bangles.  This had a disturbing effect upon me and I was given a suggestion in the sleep that I  should blow over them, so I blew over them and they were no more. And I interpreted  these (two bangles) as the two great liars who would appear after me and the one  amongst them was ‘Anasi the inhabitant of San’a’ and the other one Musailima the  inhabitant of Yamama.

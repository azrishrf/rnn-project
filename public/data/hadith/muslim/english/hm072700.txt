7|2700|  Chapter: Applying of perfume to the body before entering upon the state of Ihram.  Muhammad b. al-Muntashir reported on the authority of his father: I heard from Ibn ‘mar  having said this: “It is dearer to me to rub tar (on my body) than to enter upon the state  of Ihram (in a state) of shaking off the perfume.” He (the narrator) said: I went to ‘Aisha  and told her about this statement of his (of Ibn ‘Umar). Thereupon she said: I applied  perfume to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he then went round  his wives and then entered upon the state of Ihram in the morning.

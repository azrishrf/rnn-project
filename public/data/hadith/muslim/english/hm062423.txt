6|2423|  Chapter: The time for breaking the fast and ending of day.  Ibn Abi Aufa (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were with the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) on a journey. When the sun sank he said to a person: Get  down and prepare barley meal for us. Upon this he said: Messenger of Allah, let there  be dusk. (He the Holy Prophet) said: Get down and prepare barley meal for us. He (the  person) said: There is still (the light of) day upon us. (But) he got down (in obedience to  the command of the Holy Prophet) and prepared a barley meal for him and he (the Holy  Prophet) drank that (liquid meal) and then said: When you see the night approaching  from that side (west) (and he pointed towards the east with his hand), then the observer  of the fast should break it.

20|4593|  Chapter: It is forbidden to a Muhajir to return to his native place for the purpose of  resettling there.         It has been narrated by Salama b. al-Akwa’ that he visited al-Hajjaj who said to him: O  son of al-Akwa’, you have turned apostate and have come to live again in the desert  with the Bedouins (after your migration). He said: No, but the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) has permitted me to live in the desert.

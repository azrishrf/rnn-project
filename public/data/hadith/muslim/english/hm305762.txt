30|5762|  Chapter: The fragrance of the sacred body of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its  agility and softness and the blessings of its touch.  Anas b. Malik reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came to the house  of Umm Sulaim and slept in her bed while she was away from her house. On the other  day too he slept in her bed. She came and it was said to her: It is Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) who is having siesta in your house, lying in your bed. She came  and found him sweating and his sweat falling on the leather cloth spread on her bed.  She opened her scent-bag and began to fill the bottles with it. Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) was startled and woke up and said: Umm Sulaim, what are you  doing? She said: Allah’s Messenger, we seek blessings for our children through it.  Thereupon he said: You have done something right.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

2|520|  Chapter: Wiping over the socks.  Hummam reported: Jarir urinated, then performed ablution and wiped over the socks. It  was said to him: Do you do like this? He said: Yes, I saw that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) urinated, then performed ablution and then wiped over his  shoes. A’mash said: Ibrahim had observed that this hadith was a surprise for them (the  people) because Jarir had embraced Islam after the revelation of Surat al-Ma’ida.

Abdullah reported: On the day of Hunain, the Messenger of Allah(may peace be upon  him) showed preference (to some) People in the distribution of the spoils. He bestowed  on Aqra’ b. Habis one hundred camels, and bestowed an equal (number) upon ‘Uyaina,  and bestowed on people among the elites of Arabia, and preferred them) (to others) on  that day, in the distribution (of spoils). Upon this a person said: By Allah, neither justice  has been done In this distribution (of spoils), nor has the pleasure of Allah been sought  in it. I (the Narrator) said: By Allah, I will certainly inform the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) about it, so I came to him and informed him about what he had  said: The colour of his (the Prophet’s) face changed red like blood and he then said:  Who would do justice, if Allah and His Messenger do not do justice? He further said:  May Allah have mercy upon Moses; he was tormented more than this, but he showed  patience. I said: Never would I convey him (the Holy Prophet) after this (unpleasant)  narration.

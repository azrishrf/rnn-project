10|3742|  Chapter: Sharing of fruits.  Rafi b. Khadij (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We used to give on rent land during  the lifetime of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). We rented it on the share of  one-third or one-fourth of the (produce) along with a definite quantity of corn. One day a  person from among my uncles came to us and said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) forbade us this act which was a source of benefit to us, but the obedience to  Allah and to His Messenger (may peace be upon him) is more beneficial to us. He  forbade us that we should rent land with one-third or one-fourth of (the produce) and the  corn of a measure, and he commanded the owner of land that he should cultivate it or  let it be cultivated by other (persons) but he showed disapproval of renting it or anything  besides it.

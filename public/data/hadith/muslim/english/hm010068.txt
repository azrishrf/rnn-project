1|68|  Chapter: Concerning the attributes by which one gets the relish of Iman.  It is reported on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) said: There are three qualities for which any one who is characterised by them will  relish the savour of faith: that he loves man and he does not love him but for Allahâ€™s  sake alone; he is to whom Allah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; he who  prefers to be thrown into fire than to return to unbelief after Allah has rescued him out of  it.

Malik to tell me  about something he knew about Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), viz.  where he observed the noon prayer on Yaum al-Tarwiya. He said: At Mina. I said:  Where did he observe the afternoon prayer on the Yaum an-Nafr? and he said: It was at  al-Abtah. He then said: Do as your rulers do.

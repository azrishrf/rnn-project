35|6531|  Chapter: Excellence of remembering Allah in a low voice.  Abu Musa, reported. We were along with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  in an expedition. The rest of the hadith is the same (and there is an addition of these  words in that): “He (the Holy Prophet) said: He Whom you are supplicating is nearer to  every one of you than the neck of his camel.” And there is no mention of these words:  “There is no might and no power but that of Allah.”  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

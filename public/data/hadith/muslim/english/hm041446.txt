4|1446|  Chapter: Who deserves most to act as Imam.  Khufaf b. Ima’ reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him), bowed  (in prayer) and then lifted his head and then said: So far as the tribe of Ghifar is  concerned, Allah had pardoned it, and Allah had granted protection to the tribe of  Aslam, and as for the tribe of Usayya, It had disobeyed Allah and His Messenger, (and  further said): O Allah! curse the tribe of Lihyan curse Ri’l, and Dhakwan, and then fell in  prostration. It is after this that the cursing of the unbelievers got a sanction.

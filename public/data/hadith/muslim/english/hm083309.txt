8|3309|  Chapter: It is permissible for the father to give the hand of his daughter in marriage even when  she is not fully grown up.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon  him) married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house at the age of  nine. She further said: We went to Medina and I had an attack of fever for a month, and  my hair had come down to the earlobes. Umm Ruman (my mother) came to me and I  was at that time on a swing along with my playmates. She called me loudly and I went  to her and I did not know what she had wanted of me. She took hold of my hand and         took me to the door, and I was saying: Ha, ha (as if I was gasping), until the agitation of  my heart was over. She took me to a house, where had gathered the women of the  Ansar. They all blessed me and wished me good luck and said: May you have share in  good. She (my mother) entrusted me to them. They washed my head and embellished  me and nothing frightened me. Allah’s Messenger (, May peace be upon him) came  there in the morning, and I was entrusted to him.

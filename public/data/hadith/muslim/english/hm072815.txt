7|2815|  Chapter: Permissibility of the Tamattu’ (form of pilgrimage).         ‘Abdullah b. Shaqiq reported that ‘Uthman (Allah be pleased with him) used to forbid  Tamattu’, whereas ‘Ali (Allah be pleased with him) ordered to do it. ‘Uthman said a word  to ‘Ali, but ‘Ali said: You know that we used to perform Tamattu’ with the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: It is right, but we entertained fear.  This Hadith has been narrated by Shu’ba with the same chain of transmitters.

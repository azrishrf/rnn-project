7|2735|  Chapter: It is permissible to shave the head in the state of Ihram if there is a trouble,  and expiation becomes obligatory for shaving.  Ka’b b. ‘Ujra (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be, upon him) stood near him and lice were falling from his head. Thereupon he  (the Holy Prophet) said: Do these vermin’s trouble you? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said:  Then shave your head; and it was in connection with me that this verse was revealed:  “Whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head, he (may effect) a  compensation by fasting or alms or a sacrifice”. He (the Holy Prophet, therefore) said to  me: Observe fast for three days or give a quantity of alms enough to feed six needy  persons or offer sacrifice (of an animal) that is available.

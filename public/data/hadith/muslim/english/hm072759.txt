7|2759|  Chapter: Permissibility of entering into the state Ihram conditionally due to illness.  Ibn Abbas reported that Duba’a bint al-Zubair b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib (Allah be pleased with  her) came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: I am an ailing         woman but I intend to perform Hajj; what you command me (to do)? He (the Holy  Prophet) said: Enter into the state of Ihram (uttering these words) of condition: I would  be free from it when Thou wouldst detain me. He (the narrator) said: But she was able  to complete (the Hajj without breaking down).

31|6093|  Chapter: The merits of the Ash’arites (Allah be pleased with them).  Abu Musa reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I recognise  the voice of the Ash’arites while they recite the Qur’an as they arrive during the night  and I also recognise their station from the recital of the Qur’an during the night time,  although I have not seen their encampments as they encamp during the day time. And  there is a person amongst them, Hakim; when he encounters the horsemen or the  enemies he says to them: My friends command you to wait for them.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

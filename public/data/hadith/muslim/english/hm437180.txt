43|7180|  Chapter: Compel not your slave-girls to prostitution.  Jabir reported that ‘Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul used to say to his slave-girl: Go and fetch  something for us by committing prostitution. It was in this connection that Allah, the  Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse: “And compel not your slave-girls to  prostitution when they desire to keep chaste in order to seek the frail goods of this  world’s life, and whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful” (xxiv. 33).

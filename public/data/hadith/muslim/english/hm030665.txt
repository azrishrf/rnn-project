3|665|  Chapter: One should draw around a curtain while taking a bath.  This Hadith is narrated by Sa’id b. Abu Hind with the same chain of transmitters and  said: His (the Holy Prophet’s) daughter Fatimah provided him privacy with the help of         his cloth, and when he had taken a bath he took it up and wrapped it around him and  then stood and offered eight rak’ahs of the forenoon prayer.

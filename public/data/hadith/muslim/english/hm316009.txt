31|6009|  Chapter: The merits of Umm Aiman (Allah be pleased with her).  Anas reported that after the death of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) Abu  Bakr said to ‘Umar: Let us visit Umm Aiman as Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) used to visit her. As we came to her, she wept. They (Abu Bakr and Umar) said to  her: What makes you weep? What is in store (in the next world) for Allah’s-Messenger  (may peace be upon him) is better than (this worldly life). She said: I weep not because  I am ignorant of the fact that what is in store for Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) (in the next world) is better than (this world), but I weep because the revelation  which came from the Heaven has ceased to come. This moved both of them to tears  and they began to weep along with her.             HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

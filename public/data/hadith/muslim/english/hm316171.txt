31|6171|  Chapter: The merits of Uwais Qarani (Allah be pleased with him).  ‘Umar b. Khattab reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as  saying: Worthy amongst the successors would be a person who would be called Uwais.  He would have his mother (living with him) and he would have (a small) sign of leprosy.  Ask him to beg pardon for you (from Allah).             HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

31|5967|  Chapter: The merits of Hadrat Khadija, mother of the faithful (Allah be pleased with her).  Abu Huraira reported that Gabriel came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  and said: Allah’s Messenger, lo. Khadija is coming to you with a vessel of seasoned  food or drink. When she comes to you, offer her greetings from her Lord, the Exalted  and Glorious, and on my behalf and give her glad tidings of a palace of jewels in  Paradise wherein there is no noise and no toil. This hadith has been narrated on the  authority of Abu Huraira through another chain of transmitters with a slight variation of  wording.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

13|4016|  Chapter: He who has not anything with him to will away should not do it.  Ibn Abbas reported: When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to  leave this world, there were persons (around him) in his house, ‘Umar b. al-Kbattab  being one of them. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Come, I may write for  you a document; you would not go astray after that. Thereupon Umar said: Verily Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) is deeply afflicted with pain. You have the Qur’an  with you. The Book of Allah is sufficient for us. Those who were present in the house  differed. Some of them said: Bring him (the writing material) so that Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) may write a document for you and you would never go astray  after him And some among them said what ‘Umar had (already) said. When they  indulged in nonsense and began to dispute in the presence of Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him), he said: Get up (and go away) ‘Ubaidullah said: Ibn Abbas used to  say: There was a heavy loss, indeed a heavy loss, that, due to their dispute and noise.  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) could not write (or dictate) the document  for them.

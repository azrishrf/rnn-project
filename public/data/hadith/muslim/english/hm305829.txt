30|5829|  Chapter: Respect of Allah’s Messenger and abandoning of too many questions especially those  for which there is no genuine need.  Abu Musa reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) was asked such  things which he disapproved and when they persisted on asking him he felt enraged  and then said to the people: Ask me what you wish to ask. Thereupon a person said:  Who is my father? He said: Your father is Hudhafa. Then another person stood up and  said: Allah’s Messenger, who is my father? He said: Your father is Salim, the freed  slave of Shaiba. When ‘Umar saw the signs of anger upon the face of Allah’s Apostle  (may peace be upon him), he said: Allah’s Messenger, we ask repentance from Allah.  And in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Kuraib (the words are): “Allah’s  Messenger, who is my father? He said: Your father is Salim, the freed slave of Shaiba.”  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

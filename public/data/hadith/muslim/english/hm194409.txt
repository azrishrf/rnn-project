19|4409|  Chapter: The treaty of Hudaibiya.  It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said: When they  (Companions of the Holy Prophet) were overwhelmed with grief and distress on his  return from Hudaibiya where he had slaughtered his sacrificial beasts (not being  allowed to proceed to Mecca), the Qur’anic verse: Inna fatahna... laka fathan mobinan  to fauzan ‘aziman, was revealed to him. (At this) he said: On me has descended a verse  that is dearer to me than the whole world.

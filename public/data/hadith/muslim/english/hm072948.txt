7|2948|  Chapter: Returning from ‘Arafat to Muzdalifa and excellence of observing sunset and  ‘Isha prayers together at Muzdalifa.  Hisham (Allah be pleased with him) reported from his father: Usama (Allah be pleased  with him) was asked in my presence or I asked Usama b. Zaid and he rode behind  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he came back from ‘Arafat. I said (to  him): How did Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) journey as he came back  from ‘Arafat? Thereupon he said: He made it (his riding camel) walk at a slow speed,  and when he found an open space, he made it walk briskly.

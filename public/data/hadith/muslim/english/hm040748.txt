4|748|  Chapter: The Holy Prophet refrained from attacking people living in Dar al-Kufr on bearing  Adhan from them.  ‘Umar b. al-Khattab reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  When the Mu’adhdhin says: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, and one of you  should make this response: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest; (and when the  Mu’adhdhin) says: I testify that there is no god but Allah, one should respond: I testify  that there is no god but Allah, and when he says: I testify that Muhammad is the  Messenger of Allah, one should make a response: I testify that Muhammad is Allah’s  Messenger. When he (the Mu’adhdhin) says: Come to prayer, one should make a  response: There is no might and no power except with Allah. When he (the Mu’adhdhin)  says: Come to salvation, one should respond: There is no might and no power except  with Allah, and when he (the Mu’adhdhin) says: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the  Greatest, then make a response: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest. When he  (the Mu’adhdhin) says: There is no god but Allah, and he who makes a response from  the heart: There is no god but Allah, he will enter Paradise.

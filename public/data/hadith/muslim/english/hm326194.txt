32|6194|  Chapter: Kindness towards the friends of one’s father and mother.  Abdullah b. Dinar reported that when ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar set out to Mecca, he kept a  donkey with him which he used as a diversion from the tedium of journey on the camel’s  back and had a turban which he tied round his head. One day, as he was riding the  donkey a desert Arab happened to pass by him. He (‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar) said: Aren’t  you so and so? He said: Yes He gave him his donkey and said: Ride it, and tie the  turban round your head. Some of his companions said: May Allah pardon you, you gave  to this desert Arab the donkey on which you enjoyed ride for diversion and the turban  which you tied round your head. Thereupon he said: Verily I heard Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) as saying: The finest act of goodness is the kind treatment of  a person to the loved ones of his father after his death and the father of this person was  a friend of ‘Umar.

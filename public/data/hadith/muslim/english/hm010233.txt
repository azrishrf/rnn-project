1|233|  Chapter: Whenever a person intends to do a good deed, it is recorded, but whenever  he intends to commit evil, it is not written.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: The Great and the Glorious Lord said (to angels): Whenever My  bondsman intends to corn it an evil, do not record it against him, but if he actually  commits it, then write it as one evil. And when he intends to do good but does not do it,  then take it down is one act of goodness, but if he does it, then write down ten good  deeds (in his record).

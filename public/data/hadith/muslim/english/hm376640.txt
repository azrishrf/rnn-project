37|6640|  Chapter: The mercy of Allah predominates his wrath.  Abu Sa’id Khudri reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that a  person amongst the earlier nations before you was conferred property and children by  Allah, He said to his children: ‘You must do as I command you to do, otherwise I will  make others besides you as my inheritors. As I die, burn my body and blow my ashes in  the wind as I do not find any merit of mine which would please Allah, and if Allah were  to take hold of me, He would punish me. He took a pledge from them and they did as he  commanded therein to do. Allah said: What prompted you to do this? He said: My Lord.  Thine fear, and Allah did not punish him at all.

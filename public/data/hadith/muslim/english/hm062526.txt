6|2526|  Chapter: On which day the fast is to be observed in Muharram.  Hakam b. al-‘Araj reported: I went to Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be Pleased with both of them)  and he was reclining using his mantle as a pillow near the fountain of Zamzam. I said to  him: Tell me about fasting on Ashura. He said: When you see the new moon of  Muharram then count the (days) and observe fast on the 9th. I said to him: Is it how the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed the fast? He said: Yes.

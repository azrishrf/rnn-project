35|6577|  Chapter: The reciting of Subbin Allah in the morning and at the time of sleeping.  It is reported on the authority of Ali that Fatima had corns in her hand because of  working at the hand-mill. There had fallen to the lot of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) some prisoners of war. She (Fatima) came to the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him) but she did not find him (in the house). She met ‘Aisha and informed her  (about her hardship). When Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came, she  (‘Aisha) informed him about the visit of Fatima. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) came to them (Fitima and her family). They had gone to their beds. ‘Ali further  (reported): We tried to stand up (as a mark of respect) but Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: Keep to your beds, and he sat amongst us and I felt coldness  of his feet upon my chest. He then said: May I not direct you to something better than  what you have asked for? When you go to your bed, you should recite Takbir (Allah-O- Akbar) thirty-four times and Tasbih (Subhdn Allah) thirty-three times and Tahmid (al- Hamdu li-Allah) thirty-three times, and that is better than the servant for you.

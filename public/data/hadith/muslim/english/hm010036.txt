1|36|  Chapter: He who accepts Islam at the death-bed, before the actual agony of death, is a  Muslim. It is forbidden to supplicate blessings for the polytheists. He who dies as a  polytheist is one among the denizens of Hell and no means would be effective enough  to take him out of that.  It is reported by Sa’id b. Musayyib who narrated it on the authority of his father  (Musayyib b. Hazm) that when Abu Talib was about to die, the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) came to him and found with him Abu Jahl (‘Amr b. Hisham) and  ‘Abdullah b. Abi Umayya Ibn al-Mughirah. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) said: My uncle, you just make a profession that there is no god but Allah, and I will  bear testimony before Allah (of your being a believer), Abu Jahl and ‘Abdullah b. Abi  Umayya addressing him said: Abu Talib, would you abandon the religion of ‘Abdul- Muttalib? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) constantly requested him  (to accept his offer),and(on the other hand) was repeated the same statement (of Abu  Jahl and ‘Abdullah b. Abi Umayya) till Abu Talib gave his final decision and be stuck to  the religion of ‘Abdul-Muttalib and refused to profess that there is no god but Allah.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: By Allah, I will persistently beg pardon for  you till I am forbidden to do so (by God), It was then that Allah, the Magnificent and the  Glorious, revealed this verse:  “It is not meet for the Prophet and for those who believe that they should beg pardon for  the polytheists, even though they were their kith and kin, after it had been made known  to them that they were the denizens of Hell” (ix. 113)  And it was said to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him):  “Verily thou canst not guide to the right path whom thou lovest. And it is Allah Who  guideth whom He will, and He knoweth best who are the guided”(xxviii, 56).

7|2935|  Chapter: The pilgrim should continue to pronounce Talbiya until the stoning of Jamrat  al-‘Aqaba on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu’l-Hajja).  ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Yazid reported that ‘Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) pronounced Talbiya as he  returned from the gathering of the people (at Muzdalifa). It was said: He might be a  Bedouin (not knowing correctly the rituals of Hajj and, therefore, pronouncing Talbia at  this stage), whereupon Abdullah said: Hive the people forgotten (this Sunnah of the  Holy Prophet) or have they gone astray? I heard him, upon whom Sibrah al-Baqara was  revealed, pronouncing Talbiya at the very place.

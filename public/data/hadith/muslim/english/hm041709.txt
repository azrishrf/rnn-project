4|1709|  Chapter: What has been related (from the Holy Prophet) about one who sleeps the  whole night till morning.  Zaid b. Thabit reported that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) made an  apartment in the mosque of mats, and he observed in it prayers for many nights till  people began to gather around him, and the rest of the Hadith is the same but with this  addition: “Had this (Nafl) prayer become obligatory for you, you would not be able to  observe it.”

20|4549|  Chapter: Patience at the tyranny of the governors and their undue preferences.  It has been narrated on the authority of Usaid b. Hudair that a man from the Ansar took  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) aside and said to him: Will you not  appoint me governor as you have appointed so and so? He (the Messenger of Allah)  said: You will surely come across preferential treatment after me, so you should be  patient until you meet me at the Cistern (Haud-i-Kauthar).

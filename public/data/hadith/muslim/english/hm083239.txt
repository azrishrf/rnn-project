8|3239|  Chapter: One who can support a wife should marry.  Sa’id b. al Musayyib heard Sa’d b. Abi Waqqas (Allah be pleased with him) saying that  Uthman b. Maz’un decided to live in celibacy, but Allah’s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) forbade him to do so, and if he had permitted him, we would have got  ourselves castrated.

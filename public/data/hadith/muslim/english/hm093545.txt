9|3545|  Chapter: It is obligatory to abstain from adornment during the ‘Idda period, but  mourning beyond three days is prohibited.  Safiyya bint Abu ‘Ubaid reported on the authority of Hafsa or ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased  with them) or from both of them that Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon him) said:  It is not permissible for a woman believing in Allah and the Hereafter (or believing in  Allah and His Messenger) that she should observe mourning for the dead beyond three  days except in case of her husband.

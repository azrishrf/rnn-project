6|2550|  Chapter: Permissibility of completing the fasts of Ramadhan before the commencement of the  coming Ramadhan.  This Hadith is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Sa’id with the same chain of  transmitters but with this variation that he said that (‘Aisha did not observe fast but in  Sha’ban) out of regard for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). (In another  version, the words are): “Yahya said: I think it was due to the regard for the Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him).”

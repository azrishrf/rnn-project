15|4062|  Chapter: It is excellent to break the vow if one finds it better doing that which is against this vow  one should expiate it.  Abd al-Rahman b. Samura reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  said to me: Abd al-Rahman b. Samura, don’t ask for authority for if it is granted to you  for asking for it, you would be commissioned for it (without having the support of Allah),  but if you are granted it without your asking for it. You would be helped (by Allah) in it.  And when you take an oath and find something else better than that, expiate for  (breaking) your oath, and do that which is better. This hadith has also been transmitted  on the authority of Ibn Farrukh.

4|1736|  Chapter: Desirability of reciting the Qur’an in a sweet voice.  Mu’awiya b. Qurra reported ‘Abdullah b. Mughaffal al-Muzani as saying: The Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him) recited on his ride Surat al Fath during a journey in the  year of the Conquest (of Mecca), and he repeated(the words) in his recitation. Mu’awiya  said: If I were not afraid that the people would crowd around me, I would have given a  demonstration of (the Prophet’s) recitation before you.

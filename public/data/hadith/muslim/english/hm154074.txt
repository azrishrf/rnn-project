15|4074|  Chapter: What a non-believer should do with his vow when he embraces Islam.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar reported that ‘Umar b. Khattab asked the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) as he was at ji’rana (a town near Mecca) on his way back from  Ta’if: Messenger of Allah, I had taken a vow during the days of Ignorance that I would  observe I’tikaf for one day in the Sacred Mosque. So what is your opinion? He said: Go  and observe I’tikaf for a day. And Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave  him a slave girl out of the one-fifth (of the spoils of war meant for the Holy Prophet). And  when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set the war prisoners free. ‘Umar b.  Khattab heard their voice as they were saying: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) has set as free. He (Hadrat ‘Umar) said: What is this? They said: Allah’s         Messenger (may peace be upon him) has set free the prisoners of war (which had fallen  to the lot of people). Thereupon he (Hadrat ‘Umar) said: Abdullah, go to that slave-girl  and set her free.

1|351|  Chapter: The way in which the believers would see the Lord.  Hammam b.Munabbih said: This is what Abu Huraira transmitted to us from the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and he narrated many of them;- one of  them was: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The lowest in rank  among you in Paradise would be asked: Desire (whatever you like). And he would  express his desire and again and again express a desire. He would be asked: Have you  expressed your desire? He would say: Yes. Then He (Allah) would say: For thee is  (granted) what thou desirest, and the like of it along with it.

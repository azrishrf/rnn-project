1|14|  Chapter: Concerning Iman by which a person would enter Heaven.  It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that a bedouin came to the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, direct me to a deed by  which I may be entitled to enter Paradise. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked:  You worship Allah and never associate anything with Him, establish the obligatory  prayer, and pay the Zakat which is incumbent upon you, and observe the fast of  Ramadan. He (the bedouin) said: By Him in Whose hand is my life, I will never add  anything to it, nor will I diminish anything from it. When he (the bedouin) turned his  back, the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: He who is pleased to see a man from  the dwellers of Paradise should catch a glimpse of him.

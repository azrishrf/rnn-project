30|5765|  Chapter: Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) perspired when revelation descended upon  him.  ‘Aisha reported that Harith b. Hisham asked Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him):  How does the wahi (inspiration) come to you? He said: At times it comes to me like the  ringing of a bell and that is most severe for me and when it is over I retain that (what I  had received in the form of wahi), and at times an Angel in the form of a human being  comes to me (and speaks) and I retain whatever he speaks.

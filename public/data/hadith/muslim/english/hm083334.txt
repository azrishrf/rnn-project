8|3334|  Chapter: Pertaining to the marriage of Zainab bint Jahsh with the Holy Prophet (May peace be  upon him) and verses pertaining to purdah veil).  Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was the best informed among the  people pertaining to Hijab (veil and seclusion). Ubayy b. Ka’b used to ask me about it.  Anas (Allah be pleased with him) thus narrated: The Messenger of Allah (May peace be  upon him) got up in the morning as a bridegroom of Zainab bint jahsh (Allah be pleased  with her) as he had married her at Medina. He invited people to the wedding feast after  the day had well risen. There sat Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) and  there kept sitting along with him some persons after the people had stood up (for  departure); then Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) stood up and walked on  and I also walked along with him until he reached the door of the apartment of ‘Aisha  (Allah be pleased with her). He then thought that they (those who had been sitting there  after meal) had gone away. So he returned and I also returned with him, but they were  still sitting at their places. So he returned for the second time and I also returned until he  reached the apartment of ‘Aisha. He again returned and I also returned and they had  (by that time) stood up, and he hung a curtain between me and him (at the door of the  apartment of Hadrat Zainab, where he had to stay), and Allah revealed the verse  pertaining to veil.

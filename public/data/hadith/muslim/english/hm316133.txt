31|6133|  Chapter: The merits of the tribes of Ghifir, Ashia’, Muzaina, Tamim, Daws and Tayyi.  Abu Huraira reported: Since I heard three things from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) my love for Banu Tamim is never on the decline (and these things are): I  heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying about them that they  would put up stout resistance against Dajjal amongst my Umma. And he (the narrator)  said: (When) the consignment of Zakat was brought to him, Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: This is the charity of our people, and there was one slave-girl  in the house of ‘Aisha and she was from the tribe of Banu Tamim; thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Set her free, for she is from the offspring of  Isma’il. The other hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Huraira with a  slight variation of wording.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

9|3591|  Chapter: The right of inheritance of property vests with one who emancipates the slave.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: She wanted to buy Barira with a view to  emancipating her. They (the sellers) laid down the condition that the right of inheritance  would vest (with them). She (Hadrat ‘Aisha) made a mention of that to Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: Buy her and emancipate her  for the right of inheritance vests with one who emancipates. Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) was given meat as gift. They (his Companions) said to Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him): This was given as charity to Barira, whereupon he  said: That is charity for her but gift for us. And she was given option (to retain her  matrimonial alliance or to break it). Abd al-Rahman said: Her husband was a free man.  Shu’ba said: I then asked him (one of the narrators) about Barira’s husband (whether he  had been a free mart or a slave), whereupon he said: I do not know.

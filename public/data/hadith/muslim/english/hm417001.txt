41|7001|  Chapter: Story of Ibn Sayyid.  Abdullah b. Umar reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went along  with him in the company of some persons and there was Umar b. Khattab also amongst  them till they saw Ibn Sayyad as a young boy just on the threshold of adolescence  playing with children near the battlement of Bani Mu’awiya; the rest of the hadith is the  same but with these concluding words: “Had his mother left him (to murmur) his matter  would have become clear.”

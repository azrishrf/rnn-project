25|5331|  Chapter: Disapproval of giving ugly names and such names as can be treated as ill omens.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) decided to  forbid (his followers) to name persons as Ya’la (Elevated), Baraka (Blessing), Aflah  (Successful), Yasar and Nafi’, but I saw that he kept silent after that and he did not say  anything until Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) died. And he did not forbid  (his followers to do this), then ‘Umar decided to prohibit (people) from giving these  names, but later on gave up the idea.

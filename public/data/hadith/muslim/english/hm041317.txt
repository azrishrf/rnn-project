4|1317|  Chapter: Preference for saying the ‘Asr prayer at the commencement of the prescribed time.  Al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib reported: This verse was revealed (in this way): “Guard the prayers and  the ‘Asr prayer.” We recited it (in this very way) so long as Allah desired. Allah, then,  abrogated it and it was revealed: “Guard the prayers, and the middle prayer.” A person  who was sitting with Shaqiq (one of the narrators in the chain of transmitters) said: Now  it implies the ‘Asr prayer. Upon this al-Bara’ said: I have already informed you how this  (verse) was revealed and how Allah abrogated it, and Allah knows best. Imam Muslim  said: Ashja’i narrated it from Sufyan al-Thauri, who narrated it from al-Aswad b. Qais,  who narrated it from ‘Uqba, who narrated it from al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib who said: We recited  with the Prophet (may peace be upon him) (the above-mentioned verse like this, i.e.  instead of Salat al-Wusta, Salat al-‘Asr) for a certain period, as it has been mentioned  (in the above-quoted Hadith).

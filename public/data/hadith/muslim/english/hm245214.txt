Anas b. Malik reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had made for him  a silver ring and got engraved on it (Muhammad, Messenger of Allah) and said to the  people I have got made a ring of silver and engraved in it (these words) (Muhammad,  Messenger of Allah). So none should engrave these (words) like this engravement.

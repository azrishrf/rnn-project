26|5378|  Chapter: The right of a Muslim upon another Muslim is that his greeting should be responded.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Five are  the rights of a Muslim over his brother: responding to salutation, saying Yarhamuk Allah  when anybody sneezes and says al-Hamdulillah, visiting the sick following the bier.’ Abd  al-Razzaq said that this hadith has been transmitted as mursal hadith from Zuhri and he  then substantiated it on the authority of Ibn Musayyib.

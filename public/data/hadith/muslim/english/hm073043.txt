7|3043|  Chapter: It is meritorious for one who does intend to go himself to send the sacrificial  animal to al-Haram.  ‘Amra daughter of Abd al-Rahman reported that Ibn Ziyad had written to ‘Aisha (Allah  be pleased with him) that ‘Abdullah b. Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) bad said that  he who sent a sacrificial animal (to Mecca) for him was forbidden what is forbidden for a  pilgrim (in the state of Ihram) until the animal is sacrificed I have myself sent my         sacrificial animal (to Mecca), so write to me your opinion. Amra reported ‘Aisha (Allah  be pleased with her) as saying: It is not as Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) had  asserted, for I wove the garlands for the sacrificial animals of Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) with my own hands. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  then garlanded them with his own hands, and then sent them with my father, and  nothing was forbidden for Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which had been  made lawful for him by Allah until the animals were sacrificed.

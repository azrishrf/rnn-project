4|1691|  Chapter: Encouragement to observe prayers during Ramadhan and that is Tarawih.  Ibn Abbas reported that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) got up  during the night to pray, he used to say: O Allah, to Thee be the praise Thou art the light  of the heavens and the earth. To Thee be the praise; Thou art the Supporter of the  heavens and the earth. To Thee be the praise; Thou art the Lord of the heavens and the  earth and whatever is therein. Thou art the Truth; Thy promise is True, the meeting with  Thee is True. Paradise is true, Hell is true, the Hour is true. O Allah, I submit to Thee;  affirm my faith in Thee; repose my trust in Thee, and I return to Thee for repentance; by  Thy help I have disputed; and to Thee I have come for decision, so forgive me my  earlier and later sins, the sins that I committed in secret and openly. Thou art my God.  There is no god but Thee.

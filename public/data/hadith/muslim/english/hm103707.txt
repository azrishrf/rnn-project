Jabir b. Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported that Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) had forbidden Muhaqala and Muzabana, Mukhibara and the sale of  fruits until their good condition becomes clear, and (he commanded) that (commodities)  should not be sold but for the dinar and dirham except in case of araya.

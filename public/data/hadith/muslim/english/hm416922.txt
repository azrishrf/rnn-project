41|6922|  Chapter: The last hour will not come until the Euphrates uncovers a treasure of Gold.  ‘Abdullah b. Harith b. Naufal reported: I was standing along with Ubayy b. Kab and he  said: The opinions of the people differ in regard to the achievement of worldly ends. I  said: Yes, of course. Thereupon he said: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: The Euphrates would soon uncover a mountain of gold and when  the people would bear of it they would flock towards it but the people who would  possess that (treasure) (would say): If we allow these persons to take out of it they  would take away the whole of it. So they would fight and ninety-nine out of one hundred  would be killed. Abu Kamil in his narration said: I and Abu Ka’b stood under the shade  of the battlement of Hassan.

12|3973|  Chapter: Al-‘Umra (Life grant).  Jaber b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) as saying: He who conferred a life grant upon a person, it becomes his  possession and that of his successors, for he surrendered his right in that by his  declaration. (This property) now belongs to one to whom this lifelong grant has been  made, and to his successors. Yahya narrated in the beginning of his narration:  Whatever man is given a life grant, then it belongs to him and his posterity.

25|5317|  Chapter: Forbiddance in calling one (other than Allah’s Apostle) with the Kunya of Abdu’l- Qasim and the fact pertaining to good names.         Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported that a child was born to one of the persons amongst us and  he decided to give him the name of Muhammad We said: We will not allow you to give  the name after the name of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until you ask  him (the Holy Prophet). So he (that person) came and said (to the Holy Prophet): A child  was born in my house and I wanted to give him the name (of Muhammad) after the  name of Allah’s Messenger, whereas my people did not allow me that I should name  him after that (sacred) name until I have asked Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) in this connection, whereupon he said: Give him the name after my name, but do  not call him by my kunya, for I have been sent as a Qasim as I distribute amongst you.

37|6629|  Chapter: The mercy of Allah predominates his wrath.  Abu Huraira reported: I heard Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  Allah created mercy in one hundred parts and He retained with Him ninety-nine parts,  and He has sent down upon the earth one part, and it is because of this one part that  there is mutual love among the creation so much so that the animal lifts up its hoof from  its young, one, fearing that it might harm it.

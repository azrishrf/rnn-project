4|1771|  Chapter: Excellence of surat al-Kahf and Ayat al-Kursi.  It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: Get together, for I am going to recite one-third of the Qur’an before you.  And those who could get together gathered there. Then the Apostle of Allah (may peace  be upon him) came out and recited: “Say: He, Allah, is One.” He then entered (his  house). Some of us said to the others: Perhaps there has been some news from the  heaven on account of which he has gone Inside (the house). The Apostle of Allah (may  peace be upon him) again came out and said: I told you that I was going to recite one- third of the Qur’an; keep in mind, this (Surah Ikhlas) is equivalent to one-third of the  Qur’an.

25|5349|  Chapter: The Excellence of Tahnik of the new-born child at the time of its birth and of carrying it  to a pious person so that he may soften some dates and rub its palate with them, and  permissibility of giving name on the day of its birth and the excellence of such names as  ‘Abdullah, Ibrahim and the names of all the apostles of Allah (may peace be upon him).  Sahl b. Sa’d reported that Mundhir b. Aba Usaid was brought to Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) at the time of his birth Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon         him) placed him on his thigh and Abfi Usaid kept sitting there. Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) had been occupied with something else before him. Abu Usaid  commanded his child to be lifted from the lap of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) and so he was lifted. When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had  finished the work he said: Where is the child? Abd Usaid said: Allah’s Messenger, we  took him away. He said: What is his name? He said; Allah’s Messenger, it is so and so,  whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Nay, his name is Mundhir, and named him  Mundhir on that day.

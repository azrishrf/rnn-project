42|7102|  Chapter: Not known.  ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Hubuli reported: I heard that a person asked ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr b.  ‘Asas saying: Are we not amongst the destitute of the emigrants? Abdullah said to him:  Have you a spouse with whom you live? He said: Yes. He again said: Then you are  amongst the rich. He said: I have a servant also. Thereupon he (Abdullah b. ‘Amr b. ‘As)  said: Then you are amongst the kings.         Abu ‘Abdal-Rahman reported that three persons came to ‘Abdullah b. Amr b. ‘As while I  was sitting with him and they said: By Allah, we have nothing with us either in the form  of provision, riding animals or wealth. Thereupon he said to them: I am prepared to do  whatever you like. If you come to us, we would give you what Allah would make  available for you and if you like I would make a mention of your case to the ruler, and if  you like you can show patience also. for I have beard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Destitute amongst the emigrants would precede the rich emigrants  by forty years in getting into Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. Thereupon they said:  We then, show patience and do not ask for anything.

6|2633|  Chapter: Excellence of Lailat-ul Qadar and exhortation to find it.  Zirr b. Habaish reported: I thus asked Ubayy b. Ka’b (Allah be pleased with him): Your  brother (in faith) Ibn Mas’ud says: He who stands (for the night prayer) throughout the  year would find Lailat-ul-Qadr, whereupon he said: May Allah have mercy upon him; (he  said these words) with the intention that people might not rely only (on one night),  whereas he knew that it (Lailat-ul-Qadr) is in the month of Ramadan and it is the twenty- seventh night. He then took oath (without making any exception, i.e. without saying  Insha Allah) that it was the twenty-seventh night. I said to him: Abu Mundhir, on what  ground do you say that? Thereupon he said: By the indication or by the sign which the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave us, and that is that on that day (the  sun) would rise without having any ray in it.

31|6094|  Chapter: The merits of the Ash’arites (Allah be pleased with them).  Abu Musa reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: When the  Ash’arites run short of provisions in the campaigns or run short of food for their children  in Medina they collect whatever is with them in the cloth and then partake equally from  one vessel. They are from me and I am from them.             HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

6|2587|  Chapter: Forbiddance to observe perpetual fast and excellence of observing fast on alternate  days.  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) was informed that he could stand up for (prayer) throughout the night and observe  fast every day so long as he lived. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: Is it you who said this? I said to him: Messenger of Allah, it is I who said  that. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah may peace be upon him) said: You are not         capable enough to do so. Observe fast and break it; sleep and stand for prayer, and  observe fast for three days during the month; for every good is multiplied ten times and  this is like fasting forever. I said: Messenger of Allah. I am capable of doing more than  this. Thereupon he said: Fast one day and do not fast for the next two days. I said:  Messenger of Allah, I have the strength to do more than that. The Holy Prophet (may  peace be upon him), said: Fast one day and break on the other day. That is known as  the fasting of David (peace be upon him) and that is the best fasting. I said: I am  capable of doing more than this. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: There is nothing better than this. ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr (Allah be pleased  with them) said: Had I accepted the three days (fasting during every month) as the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said, it would have been more dear  to me than my family and my property.

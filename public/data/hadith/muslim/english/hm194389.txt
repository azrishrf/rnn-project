19|4389|  Chapter: The battle of Hunain.  It has been narrated (through a different chain of transmitters) by Abu Ishiq that a  person said to Bara’ (b. ‘Azib): Abu Umara, did you flee on the Day of Hunain? He  replied: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not retreat. (What  actually happened was that some hasty young men who were either inadequately  armed or were unarmed met a group of men from Banu Hawazin and Banu Nadir who  happened to be (excellent) archers. The latter shot at them a volley of arrows that did  not miss. The people turned to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Abu  Sufyan b. Harith was leading his mule. So he got down, prayed and invoked God’s help.  He said: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib. O God,  descend Thy help. Bara’ continued: When the battle grew fierce, we, by God would  seek protection by his side, and the bravest among us was he who confronted the  onslaught and it was the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).

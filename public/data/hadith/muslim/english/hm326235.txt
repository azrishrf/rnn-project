32|6235|  Chapter: Whenever a believer falls sick or is stricken with grief or something tike it,  there is a reward for him even if it is pricking of a thorn.  ‘Abdullah reported: I visited Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he was  running high temperature. I touched his body with my bard and said to him: Allah’s  Messenger, you are running high temperature, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said: Yes, it is so. I comparatively have a more severe fever than  any one of you. I said: Is it because there is a double reward in store for you?  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Yes, it is so. And Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) again said: When a Muslim falls ill, his  compensation is that his minor sins are obliterated just as leaves tall (in autumn). In the  hadith transmitted on the authority of Zubair there is (no mention of these words): “I  touched his body with my hands.”  OF RELATIONSHIP

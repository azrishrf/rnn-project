7|2754|  Chapter: What is to be done with a Muhrim when he dies.  Sa’id b. Jubair reported on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) that  the camel of a person broke his neck as he was in the company of Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him). The Messenger of Allah, (way peace be upon him)  commanded them (Companions) to wash him with water mixed (with the leaves of) the  lote (tree) and to keep his face exposed; (he, the narrator) said: And his head (too), for  he would be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing Talbiya.

32|6255|  Chapter: Help your brother whether he is an oppressor or an oppressed one.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported: We were along with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) in an expedition that a person from amongst the emigrants struck at the back of a  person from the Ansir. The Ansiri said: O Ansar! And the Muhijir said: O Emigrants!  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What are these  proclamations of the Days of Ignorance? They said: Allah’s Messenger, a person from  the emigrants struck at the back of an Ansari, whereupon he said: It is something  disgusting. ‘Abdullah b. Ubayy heard it and said: They have indeed done it. By Allah,  when we would return to Medina the respectable amongst them (the Ansar) would turn  away the mean (the emigrants). Thereupon ‘Umar said: Permit me so that I should  strike the neck of this hypocrite. But he (the Holy Prophet) said: Leave him, the people  may not say that Muhammad kills his companions.

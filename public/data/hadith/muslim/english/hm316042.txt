31|6042|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr b Haram, the father of Jabir (Allah be pleased with  him).  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: My father fell as a martyr on the Day of Uhud and I  attempted to uncover his face and weep, but they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet)  forbade me to do this, whereas Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not  forbid me and Fatima bint Amr, the sister of my father, was also weeping Thereupon  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: You may weep or you may not weep;  the Angels provide him shade with the help of their wings until you lift him (to be buried  in the grave).  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

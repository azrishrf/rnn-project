1|71|  Chapter: It is obligatory to love the Prophet more than the members of one’s  household: one’s child, father or even the whole of humanity.  It is reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah said: None of  you is a believer till I am dearer to him than his child, his father and the whole of  mankind.

4|1795|  Chapter: “The Qur’an has been revealed in seven modes of “reading” and its meaning.  Shaqiq reported: A person from Banu Bajila who was called Nabik b. Sinan came to  Abdullah and said: I recite mufassal surahs in one rak’ah. Upon this ‘Abdullah said:  (You recite) like the recitation of poetry. I know the manner in which the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) recited two surahs in one rak’ah.

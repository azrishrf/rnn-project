4|2089|  Chapter: Prayer over the grave.         It is narrated on the authority of â€˜Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Laila that Zaid used to recite  four takbirs on our funerals and he recited five takbirs on one funeral. I asked him the  reason (for this variation), to which he replied: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) recited thus.

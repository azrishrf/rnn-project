40|6780|  Chapter: Not known.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying that: Allah the  Exalted and Glorious, said: I have prepared for My pious servants which no eye has  ever seen, and no ear has ever heard, and no human heart has ever perceived but it is  testified by the Book of Allah. He then recited: “No soul knows what comfort has been  concealed from them, as a reward for what they did”. (xxxii.17)  INTIMATES

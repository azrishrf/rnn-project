4|1083|  Chapter: Change of Qibla from Bait-u’l-Manqdis to Ka’ba.         Jundub reported: I heard from the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) five days  before his death and he said: I stand acquitted before Allah that I took any one of you as  friend, for Allah has taken me as His friend, as he took Ibrahim as His friend. Had I  taken any one of my Ummah as a friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a friend.  Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and  righteous men as places of worship, but you must not take graves as mosques; I forbid  you to do that.

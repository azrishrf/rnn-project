30|5760|  Chapter: The fragrance of the sacred body of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its  agility and softness and the blessings of its touch.  Anas reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had a very fair  complexion and (the drops) of his perspiration shone like pearls, and when he walked  he walked inclining forward, and I never touched brocade and silk (and found it) as soft  as the softness of the palm of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I never  smelt musk or ambergris and found its fragrance as sweet as the fragrance of Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him).

20|4578|  Chapter: It is good on the part of a leader to take the oath of allegiance from his forces  when intending to fight, and an account of the allegiance of Godâ€™s pleasure under the  tree.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Zubair who heard Jabir being questioned  as to how many people were there on the Day of Hudaibiya He replied: We wore  fourteen hundred. We swore fealty to him, and Umar was holding his hand while he was  sitting Under the tree (to administer the oath). The tree was Samura (a wild tree found in  deserts). All of as took the oath of fealty at his hands except Jadd b. Qais al-Ansari who  hid himself under the belly of his camel.

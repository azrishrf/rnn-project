19|4423|  Chapter: The persecution of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) at the hands of the  infidels and hypocrites.  Abu Ishiq has narrated a similar tradition through a different chain of transmitters and  has added: He (the Messenger of Allah) loved to repeat the supplication thrice. He was  saying: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the Quraish (repeating these words thrice).  And among the Quraish, he mentioned (the names of) al-Walid b. â€˜Utba and Umayya b.  Khalaf. (The narrator says there is no doubt about the names of these persons but he  has forgotten the name of the seventh man).

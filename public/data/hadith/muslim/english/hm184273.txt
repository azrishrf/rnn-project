18|4273|  Chapter: Stray thing found by anyone.  Zaid b. Khalid al-Juhani reported that a person asked Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) about picking up of stray articles, whereupon he said: Make announcement  about it for a year, and recognise well the strap and the bag (containing that); then  spend that; and if its owner comes, make him the payment of that. He (the inquirer)  said: Messenger of Allah, what about the lost goat? he said: Take it, for that is yours or  for your brother, or for the wolf. He (again) said: (What about) the lost camel? The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was enraged until his cheeks became red  (or his face became red) and then said: You have nothing to do about that; it has feet  and a leather bag (to quench its thirst) until its owner finds it.

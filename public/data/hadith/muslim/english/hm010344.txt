1|344|  Chapter: Pertaining to his (Prophet’s) words: He is a Light; how could I see Him?-and  his words: I saw the Light.  A’mash has narrated this hadith on the same authority and said: The Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) was standing amongst us and he told us four things. He  then narrated the hadith like the one reported by Abu Mua’wiya, but did not mention the  words “His creation” and said: His veil is the light.

4|854|  Chapter: If something happens in prayers, men should glorify Allah and women should clap  hands.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do you  find me seeing towards the Qibla only? By Allah, your bowing and your prostrating are  not hidden from my view. Verily I see them behind my back.

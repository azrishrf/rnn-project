31|6167|  Chapter: It is forbidden to revile the companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do not  revile my Companions, do not revile my Companions. By Him in Whose Hand is my life,  if one amongst you would have spent as much gold as Uhud it would not amount to as  much as one much on behalf of one of them or half of it.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

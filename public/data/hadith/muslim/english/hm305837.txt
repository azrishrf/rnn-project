30|5837|  Chapter: The merits of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: No child  is born but he is pricked by the satan and he begins to weep because of the pricking of  the satan except the son of Mary and his mother. Abu Huraira then said: You may recite  if you so like (the verse): “I seek Thy protection for her and her offspring against satan  the accursed” (iii. 36). This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the  same chain of transmitters (and the words are): “The newborn child is touched by the  satan (when he comes in the world) and he starts crying because of the touch of satan.”  In the hadith transmitted on the authority of Shu’aib there is a slight variation of wording.

41|6931|  Chapter: The signs before the approach of the Last Hour.  Hudhaifa b. Usaid Ghifari reported: Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came  to us all of a sudden as we were (busy in a discussion). He said: What do you discuss  about? They (the Companions) said. We are discussing about the Last Hour.  Thereupon he said: It will not cone until you see ten signs before and (in this  connection) he made a mention of the smoke, Dajjal, the beast, the rising of the sun  from the west, the descent of Jesus son of Mary (Allah be pleased with him), the Gog  and Magog, and land-sliding in three places, one in the east, one in the west and one in  Arabia at the end of which fire would burn forth from the Yemen, and would drive people  to the place of their assembly.

23|4975|  Chapter: Permissibility to use Nabidh which is not strong and has not turned into Intoxicant.  Yahya Abu ‘Umar al-Nakhai reported that some people asked Ibn Abbas about the sale  and purchase of wine and its commerce. He asked (them): Are you Muslims? They  said, Yes. Thereupon he said: Its sale and purchase and its trade are not permissible.  They then asked him about Nabidh and he said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) went out on a journey and then came back and some persons amongst his  Companions prepared Nabidh for him in green pitcher, hollow stump and gourd. He  commanded it to be thrown away, and it was done accordingly. He then ordered them  (to prepare it.) in a water-skin and it was prepared in that by steeping raisins in water,  and it was prepared in the night. In the morning he drank out of that and on that day and         then the next night, and then on the next day until the evening. He drank and gave  others to drink. When it was morning (of the third night) he commanded what was left of  that to be thrown away.

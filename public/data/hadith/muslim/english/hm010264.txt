1|264|  Chapter: The ruler who is unjust to his subjects deserves punishment of Fire.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Malih that Ubaidullah b. Ziyad visited Ma’qil b.  Yasar in his illness. Ma’qil said to him: I am narrating to you a hadith which I would have  never narrated to you had I not been in death-bed. I heard Allah’s apostle (may peace  be upon him) say: A ruler who has been entrusted with the affairs of the Muslims but he  makes no endeavours (for the material and moral uplift) and does not sincerely mean  (their welfare) would not enter Paradise along with them.

34|6458|  Chapter: Knowledge would be taken away and ignorance would prevail upon people and the  turmoil at the end of the world.         Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: (When)  the time would draw close to the Last Hour, knowledge would be snatched away,  turmoil would be rampant, miserliness would be put (in the hearts of the people) and  there would be much bloodshed. They said: What is al-harj? Thereupon he said: It is  bloodshed.

4|1179|  Chapter: It is forbidden to cry out for finding out the lost thing in the mosque.  ‘Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said  prayer and he omitted or committed (something). Ibrahim (one of the narrators of this  Hadith) said: It is my doubt, and it was said: Messenger of Allah, has there been any  addition to the prayer? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Verily I am a human being like you. I  forget just as you forget so when any one of you forgets, he must perform two  prostrations, and he (the Holy Prophet) was sitting and then the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) turned (his face towards the Qibla) and performed two  prostrations.

3|592|  Chapter: The menstruating woman is permitted to wash the head of her husband, comb  his hair, and her left-over is clean, and one is permitted to recline in her lap and recite  the Qur’an.  Thabit narrated it from Anas: Among the Jews, when a woman menstruated, they did  not dine with her, nor did they live with them in their houses; so the Companions of the  Apostle (may peace be upon him) asked The Apostle (may peace be upon him), and  Allah, the Exalted revealed: “And they ask you about menstruation; say it is a pollution,  so keep away from woman during menstruation” to the end (Qur’an, ii. 222). The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do everything except intercourse.  The Jews heard of that and said: This man does not want to leave anything we do  without opposing us in it. Usaid b. Hudair and Abbad b. Bishr came and said:  Messenger of Allah, the Jews say such and such thing. We should not have, therefore,  any contact with them (as the Jews do). The face of the Messenger of Allah (way peace  be upon him) underwent such a change that we thought he was angry with them, but  when they went out, they happened to receive a gift of milk which was sent to the  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him). He (the Holy Prophet) called for them and  gave them drink, whereby they knew that he was not angry with them.

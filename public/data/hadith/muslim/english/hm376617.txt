37|6617|  Chapter: Exhortation for repentance.  Al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What is your opinion about the  delight of a person whose camel loaded with the provisions of food and drink is lost and  that moves about with its nose-string trailing upon the waterless desert in which there is  neither food nor drink, and lie wanders about in search of that until he is completely  exhausted and then accidentally it happens to pass by the trunk of a tree and its nose- string gets entangled in that and he finds it entangled therein? He (in response to the  question of the Holy Prophet) said: Allah’s Messenger, he would feel highly delighted.  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. By Allah, Allah is more  delighted at the repentance of His servant than that person (as he finds his lost) camel.

41|7033|  Chapter: The Hadith pertaining to the spy of the Dajjal.         This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Anas that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) said this but with this addition that (the Dajjal would come) and  pitch his tent in the waste-land of Juruf and thus there would come out of (the city) every  hypocrite, man and woman.

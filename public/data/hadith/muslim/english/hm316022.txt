31|6022|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud and that of his mother (Allah be pleased with them).  ‘Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) reported that he (said to his companions to conceal their copies of  the Qur’an) and further said: He who conceals anything he shall have to bring that  which he had concealed on the Day of judgment, and then said: After whose mode of  recitation you command me to recite? I in fact recited before Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) more than seventy chapters of the Qur’an and the Companions of  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) know it that I have better understanding of  the Book of Allah (than they do), and if I were to know that someone had better  understanding than I, I would have gone to him. Shaqiq said: I sat in the company of the  Companions of Muhammad (may peace be upon him) but I did not hear anyone having  rejected that (that is, his recitation) or finding fault with it.           HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

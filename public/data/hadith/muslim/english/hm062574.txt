6|2574|  Chapter: Permissibility of making an intention for voluntary fasting before noon and  permissibility of breaking voluntary fast without reason.  â€˜Aisha, the Mother of the Believers (Allah be pleased with her), reported: The Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him) came to me one day and said: Is there anything with  you (to eat)? I said: No. Thereupon he said: I shall then be fasting. Then he came to us  another day and we said: Messenger of Allah, hais has been offered to us as a gift.  Thereupon he said: Show that to me; I had been fasting since morning. He then ate it.

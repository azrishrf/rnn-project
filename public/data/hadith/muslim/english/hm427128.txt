42|7128|  Chapter: Sneezing and the disapproval of yawning.  Iyas b. Salama b. al-Akwa reported that his father reported to him that he heard Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: A person sneezed in his presence and he  said to him: May Allah have mercy upon you. And he then sneezed for the second time  and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: He is suffering from cold  (and no response is necessary).

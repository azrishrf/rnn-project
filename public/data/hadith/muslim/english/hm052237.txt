5|2237|  Chapter: Concerning the collection of Sadaqa and doing of good deeds.  ‘Umair, the freed slave of Abi’l-Lahm, said: My master commanded me to cut some  meat in strips; (as I was doing it) a poor man came to me and I gave him some of it to  eat. My master came to know of that, and he beat me. I came to the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. He (the Holy Prophet) summoned him  and said: Why did you beat him? He (Abi’l-Lahm) said: He gives away my food without  being commanded to do so. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: The reward would be  shared by you two.

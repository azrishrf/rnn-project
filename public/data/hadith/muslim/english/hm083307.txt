8|3307|  Chapter: Seeking consent of al-Thayyib in marriage in words and of a virgin in (meaningful)  silence.  Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) as saying: A woman who has been previously married (Thayyib) has more  right to her person than her guardian. And a virgin should also be consulted, and her  silence implies her consent.

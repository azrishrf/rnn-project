8|3366|  Chapter: It is not permissible for a woman to abandon the bed of her husband.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah’s Apostle (May peace be  upon him) said: When a woman spends the night away from the bed of her husband,  the angels curse her until morning. This hadith has been narrated through the same  chain of transmitters (with a slight variation): “He said: Until she comes back.”

22|4843|  Chapter: It is meritorious to sacrifice the animal with one’s own hand and so is  meritorious the recitation of Bismillah (in the name of Allah) and Takbir (Allah o-Akbar).         Shu’ba reported: Qatada informed me that he had heard Anas saying that Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) sacrificed (the horned rams) and like that. I said:  Did you (Qatada) hear from Anas? He said. Yes.

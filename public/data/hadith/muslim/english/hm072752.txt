7|2752|  Chapter: What is to be done with a Muhrim when he dies.         Sa’id b. Jubair reported on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) that  a camel broke the neck of its owner while he was in the state of ihram and he was at  that time in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded that he should be bathed with water  mixed with (leaves of the) lote (tree) and no perfume should be applied to him and his  head should not be covered, for he would be raised on the Day of Resurrection  pronouncing Talblya.

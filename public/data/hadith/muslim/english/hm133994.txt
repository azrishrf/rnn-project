13|3994|  Chapter: Will can be made only for one-third.  Mus’ab b. Sa’d reported on the authority of his father. I was ailing. I sent message to  Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) saying: Permit me to give away my property  as I like. He refused. I (again) said: (Permit me) to give away half. He (again refused). I  (again said): Then one-third. He (the Holy Prophet) observed silence after (I had asked  permission to give away) one-third. He (the narrator) said: It was then that endowment  of one-third became permissible.

1|229|  Chapter: Concerning the Words of Allah whether you manifest whatever is in your mind  or hide it.  It is narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas: When this verse: “Whether you disclose that  which is in your mind or conceal it, Allah will call you to account according to it” (ii 284),  there entered in their minds something (of that fear) such as had never entered their  hearts (before). The Apostle (may peace be upon him) observed: Say: We have heard  and obeyed and submitted ourselves. He (the reporter) said: Allah instilled faith in their  hearts and He revealed this verse: “Allah burdens not a soul beyond its capacity. It gets  every good that it earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. Our Lord, call us not to  account if we forget or make a mistake. He the (Lord) said: I indeed did it. Our Lord! do  not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us. He (our Lord) said: I  indeed did it. And pardon us, have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector” (ii. 286). He  said: I indeed did it.

4|1845|  Chapter: The essentiality of taking bath on Friday.  Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of, Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He  who takes a bath on Friday, the bath which is obligatory after the sexual discharge and  then goes (to the mosque), he is like one who offers a she-camel as a sacrifice, and he  who comes at the second hour would be like one who offers a cow, and he who comes  at the third hour is live one who offers a ram with horns, and he who comes at the fourth  hour is like one who offers a hen, and he who comes at the fifth hour is like one who  offers an egg. And when the Imam comes out, the angels are also present and listen to  the mention of God (the sermon).

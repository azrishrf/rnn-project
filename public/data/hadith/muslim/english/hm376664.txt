37|6664|  Chapter: The words of Allah “The good deeds take away the evil deeds”.  This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Qatida with the same chain of  transmitters but (with this variation of wording): “Allah commanded the earth (from  where) he wanted to come out to move itself away and to the other earth (where he  wanted to go) to draw nearer.”

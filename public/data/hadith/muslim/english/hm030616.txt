3|616|  Chapter: Bathing after sexual intercourse or seminal emission.  ‘Aisha reported: When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) bathed because of  sexual intercourse, he first washed his hands: he then poured water with his right hand  on his left hand and washed his private parts. He then performed ablution as is done for  prayer’. He then took some water and put his fingers and moved them through the roots  of his hair. And when he found that these had been properly moistened, then poured         three handfuls on his head and then poured water over his body and subsequently  washed his feet.

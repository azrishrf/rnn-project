4|1275|  Chapter: He who came up with the Rak’ah, he in fact came up with the prayer (led in  congregation with the Imam).  ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The  time of the noon prayer is when the sun passes the meridian and a man’s shadow is the  same (length) as his height, (and it lasts) as long as the time for the afternoon prayer  has not come; the time for the afternoon prayer is as long as the sun has not become  pale; the time of the evening prayer is as long as the twilight has not ended; the time of  the night prayer is up to the middle of the average night and the time of the morning  prayer is from the appearance of dawn, as long as the sun has not risen; but when the  sun rises, refrain from prayer for it rises between the horns of the devil.

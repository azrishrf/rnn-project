35|6518|  Chapter: The merit of an assembly for the recitation of the Qur’an or for the Dhikr  (Remembrance of Allah).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who  alleviates the suffering of a brother out of the sufferings of the world, Allah would  alleviate his suffering from the sufferings of the Day of Resurrection, and he who finds  relief for one who is hard pressed, Allah would make things easy for him in the  Hereafter, and he who conceals (the faults) of a Muslim, Allah would conceal his faults  in the world and in the Hereafter. Allah is at the back of a servant so long as the servant  is at the back of his brother, and he who treads the path in search of knowledge, Allah  would make that path easy, leading to Paradise for him and those persons who  assemble in the house among the houses of Allah (mosques) and recite the Book of  Allah and they learn and teach the Qur’an (among themselves) there would descend  upon them the tranquillity and mercy would cover them and the angels would surround  them and Allah makes a mention of them in the presence of those near Him, and he         who is slow-paced in doing good deeds, his (high) descent does not make him go  ahead.  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

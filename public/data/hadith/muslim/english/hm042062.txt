4|2062|  Chapter: Merit of the funeral prayer and following the bier.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who  attends the funeral till the prayer is offered for (the dead), for him is the reward of one  qirat, and he who attends (and stays) till he is buried, for him is the reward of two qirats.  It was said: What are the qirats? He said: They are equivalent to two huge mountains.  Two other narrators added: Ibn ‘Umar used to pray and then depart (without waiting for  the burial of the dead). When the tradition of Abu Huraira reached him, he said: “We  have lost many qirats.”

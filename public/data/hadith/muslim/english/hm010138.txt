1|138|  Chapter: The love of Ansar (helpers) and ‘All (may Allah be pleased with all of them) is  (an Ingredient) of Iman and (one of) its signs, and hatred against them is a sign of  dissemblance.  Al-Bara reported it from the Apostle(may peace and blessing be upon him) that he  observed with regard to the Ansar, None but the believer loves them, none but the  hypocrite hates them. He who loved them loved Allah and he who hated them hated  Allah. I (the narrator) said: Did you hear this hadith from al-Bara’? He said: To me, he  narrated it.

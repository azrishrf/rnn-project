4|1981|  Chapter: Mention of the torment of grave in eclipse prayer.  Asma’ daughter of Abu Bakr reported: The sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him); so he felt perturbed and he, by mistake, took  hold of the outer garment of a woman till he was given his own cloak. After this I  satisfied my need and then came and entered the mosque. I saw the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) standing in prayer. I stood along with him. He prolonged  his qiyam till I wished to sit down. Then I cast a glance towards an old woman. So I  said: She is older than I, therefore, kept standing. He (the Holy Prophet) then observed  ruku’, and prolonged his ruku’. He then raised his head. He then prolonged his qiyam to  such an extent that if a person happened to come he would have thought that he had  not observed the ruku’.

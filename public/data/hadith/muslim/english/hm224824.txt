22|4824|  Chapter: The proper time for sacrifice.  Al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib reported that his maternal uncle Abu Burda b. Niyar sacrificed his  animal earlier than the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) had sacrificed.  Thereupon he said: Apostle of Allah, it is the day of meat and it is not desirable (to have  longing for it and not to make use of it immediately), so I hastened in offering my animal  as a sacrifice, so that I might feed my family and neighbours and my kith and kin.  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Offer again your sacrifice.  He said: Messenger of Allah, I have a small milch goat of less than one year, and that is  better than two dry goats (from which only) meat (can be acquired). Thereupon he said:  That is better than the two animals of sacrifice on your behalf, and the sacrifice of a  goat, of less than six months shall not be accepted as a sacrifice on behalf of anyone  after your (sacrifice).

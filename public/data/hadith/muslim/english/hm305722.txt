30|5722|  Chapter: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is the best amongst people in  disposition and behaviour.  Anas reported: When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina,  Abla Talha took hold of my hand and brought me to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) and said: Allah’s Messenger, Anas is a prudent young boy, and he will serve  you. He (Anas) said: I served him in journey and at home, but, by Allah, he never asked         me about a thing which I did as to why I did so, nor about a thing which I did not do as  to why I had not done that.

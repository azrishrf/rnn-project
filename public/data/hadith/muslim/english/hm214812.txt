21|4812|  Chapter: It is forbidden to tie the animals (and then kill them).  Hishim b. Zaid b. Anas b. Milik reported: I visited the house of al-Hakam b. Ayyub along  with my grandfather Anas b. Milik, (and there) some people had made a hen a target  and were shooting arrows at her. Thereupon Asas said that Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) had forbidden tying of the animals (and making them the targets of  arrows, etc.). This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu’ba through other  chains of transmitters.

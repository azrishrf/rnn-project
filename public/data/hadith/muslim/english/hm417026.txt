41|7026|  Chapter: The appearance of the Dajjal and his stay upon the earth and the descent of Jesus  and his killing him (Dajjal) and the departure of good people of strong conviction and the  survival of the wicked people and the worship of idols and the blowing of the trumpet and the  raising up from the graves.  Abu Zur’a reported that three persons amongst Muslims had been sitting in Medina in  the presence of Marwan b. Hakam and they heard him narrate these signs from him  and the first amongst them was the appearance of the Dajjal. ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr reported  that Marwin said nothing (particular in this connection). I, however, heard a hadith from  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I did not forget that after I had heard  that from Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he reported a hadith like the  foregoing.

39|6760|  Chapter: None would attain salvation because of his deeds but it is through Lord’s Mercy (that  he would attain that).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: None  amongst you would attain salvation purely because of his deeds. A person said: Allah’s  Messenger, even you also. Thereupon he said: Yes. Not even I, but that Allah wraps me  in Mercy, but you should act with moderation. This hadith has been transmitted on the  authority of Bukair b. al-Ashajj with a slight variation of wording.             PARADISE AND HELL

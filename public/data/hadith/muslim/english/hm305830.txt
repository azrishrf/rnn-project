30|5830|  Chapter: It is obligatory to follow the Prophet (may peace be upon him) in all matters pertaining  to religion, but one is free to act on one’s own opinion in matters which pertain to technical skill.  Musa b. Talha reported: I and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened  to pass by people near the date-palm trees. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What are these  people doing? They said: They are grafting, i.e. they combine the male with the female  (tree) and thus they yield more fruit. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) said: I do not find it to be of any use. The people were informed about it and they  abandoned this practice. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (was later) on  informed (that the yield had dwindled), whereupon he said: If there is any use of it, then  they should do it, for it was just a personal opinion of mine, and do not go after my  personal opinion; but when I say to you anything on behalf of Allah, then do accept it,  for I do not attribute lie to Allah, the Exalted and Glorious.

4|1885|  Chapter: Warning on neglecting Jumu’a.  Jabir b. Abdullah said: When Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon him) delivered the  sermon, his eyes became red, his voice rose and his anger increased so that he was  like one giving a warning against the enemy and saying: “The enemy has made a  morning attack on you and in the evening too.” He would also say: “The last Hour and I  have been sent like these two.” and he would join his forefinger and middle finger; and  would further say: “The best of the speech is embodied in the Book of Allah, and the  beet of the guidance is the guidance given by Muhammad. And the most evil affairs are  their innovations; and every innovation is error.” He would further say: ,I am more dear  to a Muslim even than his self; and he who left behind property that is for his family and  he who dies under debt or leaves children (in helplessness), the responsibility (of paying  his debt and bringing up his children) lies on me.”

31|5898|  Chapter: The excellent qualities of ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: While I  was asleep, I saw myself in Paradise and a woman performing ablution by the side of a  palace. I said: For whom is it meant? They said: It is meant for ‘Umar b. Khattab. (The  Holy Prophet) said: There came across my mind the feeling of Umar and so I turned  back and went away. Abu Huraira said: ‘Umar wept as we were present in that meeting  with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) amongst us and Umar said: Allah’s  Messenger, may my father and mother be taken as ransom for you. Could I at all feel  any jealousy about you? This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Shihab  with the same chain of transmitters.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

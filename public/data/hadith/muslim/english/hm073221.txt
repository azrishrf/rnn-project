7|3221|  Chapter: The mosque founded on piety in the mosque of the Apostle (may peace be  upon him) at Medina.  Abu Salama b. Abd al-Rabman reported: ‘Abd al-Rabman b. Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (Allah  be pleased with him) happened to pass by me and I said to him. How did you hear your         father making mention of the mosque founded on Piety? He said: My father said: I went  to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he was in the house of one of his  wives, and said: Messenger of Allah, which of the two mosques is founded on piety?  Thereupon he took a handful of pebbles and threw them on the ground and then said:  This is the very mosque of yours (mosque at Medina). He (the narrator) said: I bear  witness that I heard your father making mention of it.

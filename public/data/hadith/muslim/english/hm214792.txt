21|4792|  Chapter: Pertaining to the flesh of the Lizard.  Khalid b. Walid reported that he visited Maimuna daughter of al-Harith with the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and she was the sister of his mother.  She presented to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) the flesh of a lizard  which Umm Hufaid daughter of al-Harith had brought from Najd, and she had been  married to a person belonging to Banu Ja’far. It was the habit of Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) not to eat anything until he knew what that was. The rest of  the hadith is the same but with this (addition): “Ibn al-Asamm narrated it from Maimuna  and he was under her care.”

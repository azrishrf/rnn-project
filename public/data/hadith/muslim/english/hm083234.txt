8|3234|  Chapter: One who can support a wife should marry.  Abu al-Rahman b. Yazid said: I and my uncle ‘Alqama and al-Aswad went to ‘Abdullah  b. Mas’ud (Allah be pleased with him). He (the narrator further) said: I was at that time  young, and he narrated a hadith which it seemed he narrated for me that Allah’s  Messenger (May peace be upon him) said like one transmitted by Mu’awiya, and further  added: I lost no time in marrying.

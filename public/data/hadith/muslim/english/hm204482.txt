20|4482|  Chapter: The people are subservient to the Quraish and the Caliphate is the right of the  Quraish.  It has been reported on the authority of Jabir b. Samura who said: I went with my father  to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and I heard him say: This religion  would continue to remain powerful and dominant until there have been twelve Caliphs.  Then he added something which I couldnâ€™t catch on account of the noise of the people. I  asked my father: What did he say? My father said: He has said that all of them will be  from the Quraish.

1|372|  Chapter: The lowest of the ranks in Paradise.  It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) said: Four persons would be brought out from the Fire and would be  presented to Allah. One of them would turn (towards the He))) and say: O my Lord,  when Thou hast brought me out from it, do not throw me back into it, and Allah would  rescue him from it.

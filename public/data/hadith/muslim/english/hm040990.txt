4|990|  Chapter: What is to be recited in bowing and prostration.  Rabi’a b. Ka’b said: I was with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) one night  and I brought him water and what he required. He said to me: Ask (anything you like). I  said: I ask your company in Paradise. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Or anything else  besides it. I said: That is all (what I require). He said: Then help me to achieve this for  you by denoting yourself often to prostration.

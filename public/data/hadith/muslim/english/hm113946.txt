11|3946|  Chapter: He who leaves behind property, that is for the heirs.  Abn Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) having said this: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, there is no  believer on the earth with whom I am not the nearest among all the people. He who  amongst you (dies) and leaves a debt, I am there to pay it, and he who amongst you  (dies) leaving behind children I am there to look after them. And he who amongst You  leaves behind property, that is for the inheritor whoever he is.

37|6644|  Chapter: Repentance is accepted so long as one repents after committing sins.         Abu Mu’sa reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that Allah,  the Exalted and Glorious, Stretches out His Hand during the night so that the people  repent for the fault committed from dawn till dusk and He stretches out His Hand daring  the day so that the people may reprint for the fault committed from dusk to dawn. (He  would accept repentance) before the sun rises in the west (before the Day of  Resurrection). A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Shu’ba with the  same chain of transmitters.

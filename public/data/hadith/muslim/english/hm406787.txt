40|6787|  Chapter: There is in paradise a tree under the shadow of which a rider can travel for a hundred  years and even then he would not be able to cover it.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said that  Allah would say to the inmates of Paradise: O, Dwellers of Paradise, and they would  say in response: At thy service and pleasure, our Lord, the good is in Thy Hand. He (the  Lord) would say: Are you well pleased now? They would say: Why should we not be  pleased, O Lord, when Thou hast given us what Thou hast not given to any of Thy  creatures? He would, however, say: May I not give you (something) even more  excellent than that? And they would say: O Lord, what thing can be more excellent than  this? And He would say: I shall cause My pleasure to alight upon you and I shall never  be afterwards annoyed with you.  INTIMATES

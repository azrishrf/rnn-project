19|4375|  Chapter: Return of their gifts to the Ansar by the Muhajirs when the latter grew rich as a  result of the conquests.  It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik who said: When the Muhajirs  migrated from Mecca to Medina; they came (in a state that) they had not anything(i.e.  money) in their hands, while the Ansar possessed lands and date palms. They divided  their properties with the Muhajirs. The Ansar divided and gave them on the condition  that they would give half the fruit from the orchards every year, and the Muhajirs would  recompense them by working with them and putting in labour. The mother of Anas b.  Malik was called Umm Sulaim and she was also the mother of ‘Abdullah b. Talha who  was a brother of Anas from his mother’s side. The mother of Anas had given the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) her date-palms. He bestowed them upon  Umm Aiman, the slave-girl who had been freed by him and was the mother of Usama b.  Zaid. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had finished the war with  the people of Khaibar and returned to Medina, the Muhajirs returned to the Ansar all the  gifts which they had given them out of the fruits. (Anas b. Malik said:) The Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) returned to my mother her date-palms and gave to  Umm Aiman instead of them date-palms from his orchard. Ibn Shihab says that Umm  Aiman was the mother of Usama b. Zaid who was the slave-girl of ‘Abdullah b. ‘Abd-ul- Muttalib and hailed from Abyssinia. When Amina gave birth to the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) after the death of his father, Umm Aiman used to nurse him  until he grew up. He (later on) freed her and married her to Zaid b. Haritha. She died  five months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).

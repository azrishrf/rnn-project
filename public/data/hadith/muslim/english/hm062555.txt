6|2555|  Chapter: Completing of the fast on behalf of the dead.  Ibn â€˜Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported: A man came to the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, my mother has died (in a state)  that she had to observe fasts of a month (of Ramadan). Should I complete (them) on  her behalf? thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Would you not pay the debt if your  mother had died (without paying it)? He said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) said: The debt  of Allah deserves more that it should he paid.

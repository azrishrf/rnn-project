4|1756|  Chapter: Excellence of listening to the Qur’an and asking one who has memorised it  and to recite it from his memory and shedding tears while listening to the recitation and  deliberating over it.  ‘Uqba b. ‘Amir reported: When we were in Suffa, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) came out and said: Which of you would like to go out every morning to  Buthan or al-‘Aqiq and bring two large she-camels without being guilty of sin or without  severing the ties of kinship? We said: Messenger of Allah, we would like to do it. Upon  this he said: Does not one of you go out in the morning to the mosque and teach or  recite two verses from the Book of Allah, the Majestic and Glorious? That is better for  him than two she-camels, and three verses are better (than three she-camels) and four  verses are better for him than four (she-camels), and to on their number in camels.

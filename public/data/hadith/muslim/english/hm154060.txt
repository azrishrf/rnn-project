15|4060|  Chapter: It is excellent to break the vow if one finds it better doing that which is against this vow  one should expiate it.  Tamim b. Tarafa reported that he beard ‘Adi b. Hatim say that a person came to him  and asked for one hundred dirhams. He (‘Adi) said: You asked Me for one hundred  dirhams and I am the son of Hatim; by Allah, I will not give you. But then he said: (I  would have done that) if I had not heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  say: He who takes an oath, but then finds something better than that, should do that  which is better.

7|2748|  Chapter: What is to be done with a Muhrim when he dies.  Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that a person proceeded along with the  Apostle of Allah (may peace he upon him) in the state of Ihram and fell down from his  camel and his neck was broken, and he died. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: Bathe him with water mixed with lote (leaves) and shroud him in two         (pieces of) cloth and do not cover his head for he would come on the Day of  Resurrection pronouncing Talbiya.

Shu’ba and the words  are: Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) kept standing in prayer (for such long  hours) that his feet were swollen. They (his Companions) said: Verily, Allah has  pardoned for thee the earlier and the later of thine sins. Thereupon he said: Should I not  prove myself to be a grateful servant (of Allah)?

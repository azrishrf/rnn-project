26|5493|  Chapter: Plague, ill omen and magic.  ‘Amir b. Sa’d b. Abu Waqqas reported on the authority of his father that he asked  Usama b. Zaid: What have you heard from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  about plague? Thereupon Usama said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  said: Plague is a calamity which was sent to Bani Isra’il or upon those who were before  you. So when you hear that it has broken out in a land, don’t go to it, and when it has  broken out in the land where you are, don’t run out of it. In the narration transmitted on  the authority of Abu Nadr there is a slight variation of wording.

4|1826|  Chapter: Excellence of observing two Rak’ahs before the evening prayer.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported: I observed prayer in danger with the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him). We drew ourselves up in two rows, one row behind him with  the enemy between us and the Qibla. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)  said: Allah is Most Great, and we all said it. He then bowed and we all bowed. He then  raised his head from bowing, we all raised (our heads). He then went down in  prostration along with the row close to him, and the rear row faced the enemy; then  when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) completed the prostration,; and  then stood up, the row near to him also did it; then went down the rear row in  prostration; then they stood up; then the rear row went to the front and the front row  went to the rear. Then the Apostle of Allah (may peace he upon him) bowed down and  we all bowed. He then raised his head from bowing and we also raised (our heads). He  and the row close to him which I had been in the rear then went down in prostration In  the first rak’ah, whereas the rear row faced the enemy. And when the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him) and the rear row close to him had finished the prostration, the  rear row went down and prostrated themselves; then the Apostle of Allah pronounced  the salutation and we also pronounced the salutation. (Jabir said we Hadith) as your  guards behave with their chiefs.

4|1821|  Chapter: Do not get into the habit of observing prayer at the time of the rising sun and  at the time of its setting.  Anas b. Malik reported: When we were in Medina, the moment the Mu’adhdhin made  the call to the sunset prayer, the people hastened to the pillars of the mosque and  prayed two rak’ahs with the result that any stranger coming into the mosque would think         that the obligatory prayer had been observed owing to the number who were praying  then.

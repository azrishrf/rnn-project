32|6363|  Chapter: The merit of according benevolent treatment to daughters.  ‘Aisha reported: A poor woman came to me along with her daughters. I gave her three  dates. She gave a date to each of them and then she took up one date and brought that  to her mouth in order to eat that, but her daughters expressed desire to eat it.

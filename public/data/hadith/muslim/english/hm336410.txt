33|6410|  Chapter: The excellence of arguments between Adam and Moses (Allah be pleased with both  of them).  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There  was argument between Adam and Moses, and Adam came the better of Moses. Moses  said to him: You are the same Adam who misled people, and caused them to get out of  Paradise. Adam said: You are the same (Moses) whom Allah endowed the knowledge  of everything and selected him amongst the people as His Messenger. He said: Yes.  Adam then again said: Even then you blame me for an affair which had been ordained  for me before I was created.

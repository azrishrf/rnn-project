20|4477|  Chapter: The people are subservient to the Quraish and the Caliphate is the right of the  Quraish.  It has been narrated on the authority of Jabir b. Samura who said: I joined the company  of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) with my father and I heard him say: This  Caliphate will not end until there have been twelve Caliphs among them. The narrator  said: Then he (the Holy Prophet) said something that I could not follow. I said to my  father: What did he say? He said: He has said: All of them will be from the Quraish.

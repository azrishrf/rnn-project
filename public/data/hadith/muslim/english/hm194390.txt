19|4390|  Chapter: The battle of Hunain.  It has been narrated through a still different chain of transmitters by the same narrator  (i.e. Abu Ishaq) who said: I heard from Bara’ who was asked by a man from the Qais  tribe: Did you run away from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the  Day of Hunain? Bara’ said: But the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did  not run away. On that day Banu Hawzzin took part in the battle as archers (on the side  of the disbelievers). When we attacked them, they retreated and we fell upon the booty;  (they rallied) and advanced towards us with arrows. (At that time) I saw the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) riding on his white mule and Abu Sufyan b. al-Harith  was holding its bridle. He (the Messenger of Allah was saying: I am the Prophet. This is  no untruth. I am a descendant of ‘Abd al-Muttalib.

40|6867|  Chapter: The dead would be shown his seat in Paradise and hell, and the affirmation of the  torment of the grave and seeking refuge from it.  Abu Huraira reported: When the soul of a believer would go out (of his body) it would be  received by two angels who would take it to the sky. Hammad (one of the narrators in  the chain of transmitters) mentioned the sweetness of its odour, (and further said) that  the dwellers of the sky say: Here comes the pious soul from the side of the earth Let  there be blessings of Allah upon the body in which it resides. And it is carried (by the  angels) to its Lord, the Exalted and Glorious. He would say: Take it to its destined end.  And if he is a non-believer and as it (the soul) leaves the body, Hammad made a  mention of its foul smell and of its being cursed-the dwellers of the sky say: There  comes a dirty soul from the side of the earth, and it would be said: Take it to its destined  end. Abu Huraira reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) put a thin  cloth which was with him upon his nose while making a mention (of the foul smell) of the  soul of a non-believer.

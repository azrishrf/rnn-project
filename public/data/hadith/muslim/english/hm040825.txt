4|825|  Chapter: The reciting of Tasmiâ€™ (Allah listens to him who praises Him) Tahmid (O our Lord, for  Thee is the praise), and Timin (Amin).  Jabir said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led the prayer and Abu  Bakr was behind him. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) recited  the takbir, Abu Bakr also recited (it) in order to make it audible to us. And the rest of the  Hadith is like one transmitted by Laith.

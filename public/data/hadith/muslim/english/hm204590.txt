20|4590|  Chapter: It is good on the part of a leader to take the oath of allegiance from his forces  when intending to fight, and an account of the allegiance of God’s pleasure under the  tree.  It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Abu Ubaid (the freed slave of Salama  b. al-Akwa’) who said: I asked Salama as to what effect he had sworn fealty to the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the Day of Hudaibiya. He said: To the  effect that we will die fighting.

6|2367|  Chapter: Fasting in Ramadan should necessarily be commenced with the sight of the new  moon and finished with the sight of the new moon. If the weather is cloudy at the beginning or at  the end, then complete thirty days.  Ibn’Umar (Allah be pleased with-both of them) reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) as saying: The month of Ramadan may consist of twenty-nine days.

7|2805|  Chapter: Performing Hajj and Umra separately.  Jabir reported Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) as saying: I have sacrificed  (the animals) here, and the whole of Mini is a place for sacrifice; so sacrifice your  animals at your places. I have stayed here (near these rocks), and the whole of Arafat is  a place for stay.

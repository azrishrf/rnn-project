1|197|  Chapter: Serious prohibition of letting down the lower garment: of laying obligation of  selling goods by false oaths, and description of those three (persons) with whom Allah  would not speak on the Day of Resurrection nor would He see towards them nor would  absolve them, and for them is a painful chastisement.         The same hadith has been transmitted by another chain of transmitters with the  exception of these words: He offered for sale a commodity to another person.

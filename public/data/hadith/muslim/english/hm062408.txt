6|2408|  Chapter: The timing of fast begins with the dawn.  Samura b. Jundub reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:  The Adhan of Bilal should not mislead you nor the whiteness (of the pillar) of dawn, for it  is not the whiteness of the true dawn, but that of the false dawn which is vertical like a  pillar and you can eat food till the streaks of whiteness spread like it.

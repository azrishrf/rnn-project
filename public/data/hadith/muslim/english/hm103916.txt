10|3916|  Chapter: Unknown.  Jabir bin â€˜Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) said that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) decreed pre-emption in every joint ownership and not divided-the  one-it may be a dwelling or a garden. It is not lawful for him (for the partner) to sell that         until his partner gives his consent. He (the partner) is entitled to buy it when he desires  and he can abandon it if he so likes. And if he (the one partner) sells it without getting  the consent of the (other partner), he has the greatest right to it.

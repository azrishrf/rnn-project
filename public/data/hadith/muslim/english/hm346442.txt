34|6442|  Chapter: Prohibition of making a hot pursuit of the allegories contained in the Qur’an and  avoiding those who do it, and of disputation in the Qur’an.  ‘Aisha reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited (these verses  of the Qur’an): “He it is Who revealed to thee (Muhammad) the Book (the Qur’an)  wherein there are clear revelations-these are the substance of the Book and others are  allegorical (verses). And as for those who have a yearning for error they go after the  allegorical verses seeking (to cause) dissension, by seeking to explain them. And none  knows their implications but Allah, and those who are sound in knowledge say: We  affirm our faith in everything which is from our Lord. It is only the persons of  understanding who really heed” (iii. 6). ‘Aisha (further) reported that Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) said (in connection with these verses): When you see such  verses, avoid them, for it is they whom Allah has pointed out (in the mentioned verses).

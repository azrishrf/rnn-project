18|4269|  Chapter: The difference of those who endeavour to arrive at the correct decision.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: While two  women had been going along with their two sons, a wolf came and made away with the  child of one of them. One of them said to her companion: It is with your child that it (the  wolf) has run away The other one said: It has run away with your child. They brought  the matter to (Hadrat) Dawud (David) for decision and he made a decision in favour of  the elder one. They then went to Sulaiman b. Dawud (may there be peace upon both of  them) and told them (the story). He said: Bring me a knife so that I may cut him (the  child) (into two parts) for you. The younger one said: No, it can’t be, may Allah have  mercy upon you, he (the child) belongs to her (the elder). So he gave a decision in  favour of the younger one. Abu Huraira said: If ever I heard of the word as-sikin at all, it  was that day. We called it by no other name but al-Mudya.

19|4448|  Chapter: The battle of Ahzab or Khandaq (the tribes or the ditch).  It has been narrated (through a still different chain of transmitters) by Anas that the  Companions of Muhammad (may peace be upon him) were chanting on the day of the  Battle of the Ditch:  We are those who have sworn allegiance to Muhammad (And made a covenant with  him) to follow Islam as long as we live.         Hammad is not sure whether Anas said: “Ala’l-Islam” or, “Ala’l-Jihad”. And the Holy  Prophet (may peace be upon him) was chanting:  O God, the real good is the good of the Hereafter, so forgive Thou the Ansar and the  Muhajirs.

31|6036|  Chapter: The merits of Sa’d b. Mu’adh (Allah be pleased with him).  Al-Bara’ reported that a garment of silk was presented to Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him). His Companions touched it and admired its softness; thereupon he said:  Do you admire the softness of this (cloth)? The handkerchiefs of Sa’d b. Mu’adh in  Paradise are better than this.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

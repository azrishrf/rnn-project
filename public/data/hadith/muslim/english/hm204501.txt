20|4501|  Chapter: The merits of a just ruler and the demerits of a tyrant ruler.  It has been narrated through a different chain of transmitters on the authority of Hasan  who said: Ibn, Ziyad paid a visit to Ma’qil b. Yasir who was seriously ill. Here follows the  same tradition as has gone before with the addition that Ibn Ziyad asked: Why didn’t  you narrate this tradition to me before this day? Ma’qil reprimanded him and said: I did  not narrate it to you or I was not going to narrate it to you.

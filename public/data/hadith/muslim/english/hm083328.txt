8|3328|  Chapter: Excellence of emancipating a slave-girl and then marrying her.  Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was sitting behind Abu Talha on the Day of  Khaibar and my feet touched the foot of Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him),  and we came (to the people of Khaibar) when the sun had risen and they had driven out  their cattle, and had themselves come out with their axes, large baskets and hatchets,  and they said: (Here come) Muhammad and the army. Allah’s Messenger (May peace  be upon him) said: Khaibar is ruined. Verily when we get down in the valley of a people,  evil is the morning of the warned ones (al-Qur’an, xxxvii. 177). Allah, the Majestic and  the Glorious, defeated them (the inhabitants of Khaibar), and there fell to the lot of  Dihya a beautiful girl, and Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) got her in  exchange of seven heads, and then entrusted her to Umm Sulaim so that she might  embellish her and prepare her (for marriage) with him. He (the narrator) said: He had  been under the impression that he had said that so that she might spend her period of  ‘Iddah in her (Umm Sulaim’s) house. (The woman) was Safiyya daughter of Huyayy.  Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) arranged the wedding feast consisting of  dates, cheese, and refined butter, and pits were dug and tiers were set in them dining         cloths, and there was brought cheese and refined butter, and these were placed there.  And the people ate to their fill, and they said: We do not know whether he (the Holy  Prophet) had married her (as a free woman), or as a slave woman. They said: If he (the  Holy Prophet) would make her wear the veil, then she would be a (free married) woman,  and if he would not make her wear the veil, then she should be a slave woman. When  he intended to ride, he made her wear the veil and she sat on the hind part of the  camel; so they came to know that he had married her. As they approached Medina,  Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) drove (his ride) quickly and so we did.  ‘Adba’ (the name of Allah’s Apostle’s camel) stumbled and Allah’s Messenger (May  peace be upon him) fell down and she (Radrat Safiyya: also fell down. He (the Holy  Prophet) stood up and covered her; the woman looked towards her and said: May Allah  keep away the Jewess! He (the narrator) said: I said: Aba Hamza, did Allah’s  Messenger (May peace be upon him) really fall down? He said: Yes, by Allah, he in fact  fell down. Anas said: I also saw the wedding feast of Zainab, and he (the Holy Prophet)  served bread and meat to the people, and made them eat to their heart’s content, and  he (the Holy Prophet) sent me to call people, and as he was free (from the ceremony)  he stood up and I followed him. Two persons were left and they were busy in talking  and did not get out (of the apartment). He (the Holy Prophet) then proceeded towards  (the apartments of) his wives. He greeted with as-Salamu ‘alaikum to every one of them  and said: Members of the household, how are you? They said: Messenger of Allah, we  are in good state ‘How do you find your family? He would say: In good state. When he  was free from (this work of exchanging greetings) he came back, and I also came back  along with him. And as he reached the door, (he found) that the two men were still busy  in talking. And when they saw him having returned, they stood up and went out; and by  Allah! I do not know whether I had informed him, or there was a revelation to him (to the  affect) that they had gone. He (the Holy Prophet) then came back and I also returned  along with him, and as he put his step on the threshold of his door he hung a curtain  between me and him, and (it was on this occasion) that Allah revealed this verse: (“O  you who believe), do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to  ‘you” (xxxiii. 53).

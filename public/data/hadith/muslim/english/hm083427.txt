8|3427|  Chapter: Suckling of a young (boy).  Umm Salama said to ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her): A young boy who is at the  threshold of puberty comes to you. I, however, do not like that he should come to me,  whereupon ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) said: Don’t you see in Allah’s Messenger  (May peace be upon him) a model for you? She also said: The wife of Abu Hudhaifa  said: Messenger of Allah, Salim comes to me and now he is a (grown-up) person, and  there is something that (rankles) in the mind of Abu Hudhaifa about him, whereupon  Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him) said: Suckle him (so that he may become  your foster-child), and thus he may be able to come to you (freely).

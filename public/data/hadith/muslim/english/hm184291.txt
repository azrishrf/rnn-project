18|4291|  Chapter: In case the provisions run short these should be pooled.  Iyas b. Salama reported on the authority of his father: We set out on an expedition with,  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). We facts hardship (in getting provisions)  until we decided to slaughter some of our riding animals. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him), commanded us to pool our provisions of food. So we spread a sheet of  leather and the provisions of the people were collected on it. I stretched myself to  measure how much that was (the length and, breadth of the sheet on which the  provisions were laid). I measured it and (found) that it was (in length and breadth) of (so  much size) on which a goat could sit. We were fourteen hundred persons. We (all) ate  until we were fully satisfied and then filled our bags with provisions. Then Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Is there any water for performing ablution. Then  there came a man with a small bucket containing some water. He threw it in a basin.  We all fourteen hundred persons performed ablution using the water in plenty. Then  there came after that eight persons and they said: Is there any water to perform  ablution? Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The ablution  has already been performed.

8|3258|  Chapter: Temporary marriage and its prohibition for all times to come.  Sabra b. Ma’bad reported that Allah’s Apostle (May peace be upon him) permitted his  Companions to contract temporary marriage with women in the Year of Victory. So I and  a friend of mine from Banu Sulaim went out, until we found a young woman of Banu  Amir who was like a young she-camel having a long neck. We made proposal to her for  contracting temporary marriage with us, and presented to her our cloaks (as dower).  She began to look and found me more handsome than my friend, but found the cloak of  my friend more beautiful than my cloak. She thought in her wind for a while, but then  preferred me to my friend. So I remained with her for three (nights), and then Allah’s  Messenger (May peace be upon him) commanded us to part with them (such women).

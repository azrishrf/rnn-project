30|5785|  Chapter: Pertaining to the old age of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Abu Juhaifa reported: I saw Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having some  whiteness (in hair) at this place, and Zuhair placed one of his fingers at his chin. Juhaifa  was asked how old he had been at that time. He said: I made arrows and put feathers to  them (i.e. I had passed my childhood).  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

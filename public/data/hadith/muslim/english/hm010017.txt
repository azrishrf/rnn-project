1|17|  Chapter: Concerning Iman by which a person would enter Heaven.  It is narrated on the authority of Jabir that a man once said to the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him): Shall I enter Paradise in case I say the obligatory prayers,  observe the (fasts) of Ramadan and treat that as lawful which has been made  permissible (by the Shariâ€™ah) and deny myself that what is forbidden, and make no  addition to it? He (the Holy Prophet) replied in the affirmative. He (the inquirer) said: By  Allah, I would add nothing to it.

41|7031|  Chapter: The Hadith pertaining to the spy of the Dajjal.  Fatima b. Qais reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sat on the  pulpit and said: O people, Tamim Dari has reported to me that some persons of his tribe  sailed in the ocean in a boat and it capsized and then some of them travelled on one of  the planks of the boat and they went to an island in the ocean. The rest of the hadith is  the same.

30|5674|  Chapter: The finality of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The similitude of  mine and that of the Apostles before me is that of a person who built a house quite imposing and  beautiful and he made it complete but for one brick in one of its corners. People began to walk  round it, and the building pleased them and they would say: But for this brick your building would  have been perfect. Muhammad (may peace be upon him) said: And I am that final brick.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

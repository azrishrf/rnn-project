6|2554|  Chapter: Completing of the fast on behalf of the dead.  Ibn ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased with both of them) reported: A woman came to the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: My mother has died, and fasts  of a month are due from her. Thereupon he said: Don’t you see that if debt was due  from her, would you not pay it? She said: Yes (I would pay on her behalf). Thereupon  he said: The debt of Allah deserves its payment more than (the payment of anyone  else).

1|385|  Chapter: Pertaining to the words of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him): “I  would be the first among people to Intercede in the Paradise and among the Apostles I  would have the largest following”.  Abu Huraira reported: Verity the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  There is for every apostle a (special) prayer with which he would pray. I wish I could  reserve, my prayer for intercession of my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection.

Ibn al-Muththanna reported on the authority of Ibn Abu’Adi who transmitted on the  authority of Ibn’Aun who narrated from al-Qasim and Ibrahim having said: I cannot  differentiate the Hadith of one from the other (Qasim and Ibrahim) that the Mother of the  Believers (Allah be pleased with her) said this: Messenger of Allah, people have come  back with two acts of worship. The rest of the Hadith is the same.

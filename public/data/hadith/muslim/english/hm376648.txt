37|6648|  Chapter: Allah’s sense of honour, and His prohibition of the abominable acts.         Abdullah b. Mas’ud reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:  None loves one’s own praise more than Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, does. It is  because of this that He has praised Himself, and none is more self-respecting than  Allah and it is because of this that He has prohibited abominable acts and there is none  who is more anxious to accept the apologies of the people than Allah Himself and it is  because of this that He has revealed the Book and sent the Messengers.

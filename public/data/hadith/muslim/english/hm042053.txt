4|2053|  Chapter: Concerning the shrouding of the dead body.  ‘Aisha reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was wrapped in a  Yamani wrapper which belonged to ‘Abdullah b Abu Bakr; then it was removed from  him, and he was shrouded in three cotton sheets of white Yamani stuff from Sahul  among which was neither a shirt nor a turban. ‘Abdullah took up the Hullah and said: I  would be shrouded in it, but then said: How is it that I should be shrouded in it in which  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was not shrouded ! So he gave it in  charity.

2|560|  Chapter: Pertaining to the urine of the suckling babe, and how it is to be washed away.  â€˜Aisha, the wife of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Babies were brought to  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he blessed them, and after  having chewed (something, e.g. dates or any other sweet thing) he rubbed there with  their soft palates. A baby was brought to him and he passed water over him (over his  garment), so he asked water to be brought and sprinkled it, but he did not wash it.

1|117|  Chapter: The condition of the Faith of one who calls his brother Muslim as an  unbeliever.  It is reported on the authority of Ibn â€˜Umar that the Messenger of Allah (may peace and  blessings be upon him) said: Any person who called his brother: or unbeliever (has in  fact done an act by which this unbelief) would return to one of them. If it were so, as he  asserted (then the unbelief of man was confirmed but if it was not true), then it returned  to him (to the man who labelled it on his brother Muslim).

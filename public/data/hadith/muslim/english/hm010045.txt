1|45|  Chapter: He who meets his Lord with implicit faith would enter Heaven and fire would  be forbidden to harm him.  It is narrated on the authority of Sunabihi that he went to Ubada b. Samit when he was  about to die. I burst into tears. Upon this he said to me: Allow me some time (so that I  may talk with you). Why do you weep? By Allah, if I am asked to bear witness, I would  certainly testify for you (that you are a believer). Should I be asked to intercede, I would  certainly intercede for you, and if I have the power, I would certainly do good to you, and  then observed: By Allah, never did I hear anything from the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) which could have been a source of benefit to you and then not  conveyed it to you except this single hadith. That I intend to narrate to you today, since I  am going to breathe my last. I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  say: He who testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the  messenger of Allah, Allah would prohibit the fire of Hell for him.

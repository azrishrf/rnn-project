8|3357|  Chapter: It is not permissible to marry a woman, who is divorced by three pronouncements until  she is married to another, man and he has a sexual intercourse with her, and then he abandons  her and she completes her ‘Idda.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon  him) was asked about a woman whom a man married and then divorced her, and then  she married (another) person, and she was divorced before sexual intercourse with her,         whether it was lawful for her first husband (to marry her in this state). He (the Holy  Prophet) said: No, until he has tasted her sweetness.

7|2842|  Chapter: Permissibility of putting off Ihram (in the midst of Hajj ceremonies) in case of  obstruction and permissibility of Qiran.  This Hadith has been narrated from Ibn Umar through another chain of transmitters  except with (this variation) that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) was mentioned  in the first part of the Hadith i.e. when it was said to him: They would bar you (from  going) to the House. He said: In that, case I would do what Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) had done. He did not mention at the end of this Hadith (i.e. these  words): “This is how the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had done,” as it  Is narrated by al-Laith.

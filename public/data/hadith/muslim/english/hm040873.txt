Munabbih reported: This is what was transmitted to us by Abu Huraira from  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and, while making a mention of a few  ahadith, said: (The Messenger of Allah directed us thus): Establish rows in prayer, for  the making of a row (straight) is one of the merits of prayer.

1|294|  Chapter: Description of the period in which Iman would not be acceptable to Allah.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) said: The (Last) Hour shall not came till the sun rises from the place of its  setting And on the day when it rises from the place of its setting even if all the people  together affirmed their faith, it would not be of any avail to one who did not believe  previously and derived no good out of his belief.

5|2219|  Chapter: The Labourer should give charity out of his wages and it is severely forbidden to  belittle one who contributes less.  Mundhir b. Jarir reported on the authority of his father: While we were in the company of  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the early hours of the morning,  some people came there (who) were barefooted, naked, wearing striped woollen  clothes, or cloaks, with their swords hung (around their necks). Most of them, nay, all of  them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The colour of the face of the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then  entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce Adhan). He  pronounced Adhan and Iqima, and he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer (along with  his Companion) and then addressed (them reciting verses of the Holy Qur’an): ‘”O  people, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single being” to the end of the verse,  “Allah is ever a Watcher over you” (iv. 1). (He then recited) a verse of Sura Hashr: “Fear  Allah. and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the morrow and fear Allah”  (lix. 18). (Then the audience began to vie with one another in giving charity.) Some  donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some donated a sa’ of wheat,  some a sa’ of dates; till he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date. Then  a person from among the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could  scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously, till I saw  two heaps of eatables and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger (may peace be  upon him) glistening, like gold (on account of joy). The Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) said: He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for  this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently,  without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam an evil precedent,  there is upon him the burden of that, and the burden of him also who acted upon it  subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.

5|2261|  Chapter: Disapproval of begging from people.         Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The poor  man (miskin) is not the one who goes round to the people and is dismissed with one or  two morsels and one or two dates. They (the Prophet’s Companions) said: Messenger  of Allah, then who is miskin? He said: He who does not get enough to satisfy him, and  he is not considered so (as to elicit the attention of the benevolent people), so that  charity way be given to him and he does not beg anything from people.

7|2716|  Chapter: Hunting is forbidden for one who is in the state of Ihram.  Abd al-Rahman b. â€˜Uthman Taimi reported on the authority of his father; While we were  with Talha b. Ubaidullah and were in the state of Ihram we were presented a (cooked)  bird. Talha was sleeping. Some of us ate it and some of us refrained from (eating) it.  When Talba awoke he agreed with him who ate it, and said: We ate it along with the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).

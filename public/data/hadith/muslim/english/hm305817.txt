30|5817|  Chapter: It is obligatory for a Muslim to follow the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him)  earnestly.  ‘Urwa b. Zubair reported that ‘Abdullah b. Zubair had narrated to him that a person from  the Ansar disputed with Zubair in the presence of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) in regard to the watering places of Harra from which they watered the date- palms. The Ansari said: Let the water flow, but he (Zubair) refused to do this and the  dispute was brought to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he said to  Zubair: Zubair, water (your date-palms), then let the water flow to your neighbour. The  Ansari was enraged and said: Allah’s Messenger, (you have given this decision) for he  is the son of your father’s sister. The face of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  underwent a change, and then said: Zubair, water (your date-palms), then hold it until it  rises up to the walls. Zubair said: I think, by Allah, that this verse: “Nay, by the Lord,  they will not (really) (believe) until they make thee a judge of what is in dispute among         them, and find in this no dislike of what thou decidest and submit with full submission”  (iv. 65).

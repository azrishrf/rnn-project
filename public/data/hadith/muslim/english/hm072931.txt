7|2931|  Chapter: The pilgrim should continue to pronounce Talbiya until the stoning of Jamrat  al-‘Aqaba on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu’l-Hajja).  Usama b. Zaid (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was sitting behind Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the riding animal from ‘Arafat. As Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) reached the left side of the mountain which was  situated near Muzdalifa, he made the camel kneel down and made water and then  came back. I poured water and he, performed light ablution. I then said: Messenger of  Allah, it is time for prayer. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:  The prayer awaits you (at the next station, Muzdalifa). Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) rode on until he came to Muzdalifa and observed prayer. Then al-Fadl         (Allah be pleased with him) sat behind Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and  reached (Muzdalifa) in the morning. Kuraib said: ‘Abdullah b. ‘Abbas (Allah be pleased  with them) narrated from al-Fadl (Allah be pleased with him) that Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) continued pronouncing Talbiya until he reached al-Jamara  (al-‘Aqaba).

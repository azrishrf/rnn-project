30|5827|  Chapter: Respect of Allah’s Messenger and abandoning of too many questions especially those  for which there is no genuine need.  Anas b. Malik reported that the people asked Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  until he was hard pressed. He went out one day and he occupied the pulpit and said:  Ask me and I shall leave no question of yours unanswered for you, and when the  people heard about it they were overawed, as if (something tragic) was going to  happen. Anas said: I began to look towards the right and the left and (found) that every  person was weeping wrapping his head with the cloth. Then a person in the mosque  broke the ice and they used to dispute with him by attributing his fatherhood to another  man than his own father. He said: Allah’s Apostle, who is my father? He said: Your  father is Hudhafa. Then ‘Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) dared say  something and said: We are well pleased with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our code  of life and with Muhammad as our Messenger, seeking refuge with Allah from the evil of  Turmoil. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Never did I see  the good and evil as today. Paradise and Hell were given a visible shape before me (in  this worldly life) and I saw both of them near this well.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

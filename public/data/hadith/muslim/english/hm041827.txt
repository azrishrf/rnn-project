4|1827|  Chapter: Excellence of observing two Rak’ahs before the evening prayer.  Jabir reported: We fought In the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) with the tribe of Juhaina. They fought with us terribly. When we had finished         the noon prayer, the polytheists said: Had we attacked them at once, we would have  killed them. Gabriel informed the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) about It  (about their evil design). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made a  mention of it to us, adding that they (the polytheists) had also said: Shortly there would  be time for the ‘Asr prayer. which is dearer o them (the Muslims) than even their  children. So when the time of the ‘Asr prayer came, we formed ourselves into two rows,  while the polytheists were between us and the Qibla. The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: Allah is Most Great, and we also said so. He bowed and we  also bowed. He went down in prostration and the first row prostrated along with him.  When they stood up, the second row went down in prostration. Then the first row went  into the rear, and the second row came in the front and occupied the place of the first  row. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then said: Allah is Most Great,  and we also said so. He then bowed, and we also bowed. He then went down in  prostration and along with him the row also (went down in prostration), and the second  row remained standing. And when the second row had also prostrated and all of them  sat down then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) pronounced salutation  to them. Abu Zubair said: Jabir made a mention specially of this thing: just as your  chiefs observe prayer.

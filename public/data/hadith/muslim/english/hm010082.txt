The same hadith has been transmitted by another chain of narrators on the authority of  ‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud who observed: Never was there one among the prophets who had  had not disciples who followed his direction and followed his ways. The remaining part  of the hadith is like that as narrated by Salih but the arrival of Ibn Mas’ud and the  meeting of Ibn ‘Umar with him is not mentioned.

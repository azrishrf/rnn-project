17|4242|  Chapter: If the beast does any harm, or if one falls in a mine or a well, there will be no blood-wit  for that.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The  wound caused (by falling) in the well, in the mine, and caused by the animal has no  requital for it ; and there is one-fifth (for the government) in the buried treasure.

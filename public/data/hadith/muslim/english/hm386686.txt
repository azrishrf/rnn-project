38|6686|  Chapter: Not known.         Abu Sa’id Khudri reported that during the lifetime of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) the hypocrites behaved in this way that when Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) set out for a battle, they kept themselves behind, and they became happy  that they had managed to sit in the house contrary to (the act of) Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him), and when Allah’s Apostle (may peace he upon him) came  back, they put forward excuses and took oath and wished that people should laud them  for the deeds which they had not done. It was on this occasion that this verse was  revealed: “Think not that those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised  for what they have not done-think not them to be safe from the chastisement; and for  them is a painful chastisement” (iii. 18).

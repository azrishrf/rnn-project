27|5591|  Chapter: The proper use of the words: Bondman, Slave-girl, Al-Maula and As-Sayyid.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: None of  you should say: My bondman and my slave-girl, for all of you are the bondmen of Allah,  and all your women are the slave-girls of Allah; but say: My servant, my girl, and my  young man and my young girl.

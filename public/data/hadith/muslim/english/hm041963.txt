4|1963|  Chapter: (Prayer for) protection (of Allah) when there is a windstorm. or (terribly dark)  cloud, and feeling joy when there is a rainfall.  ‘Aisha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), reported: I never saw  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) laugh to such an extent that I could see  his uvula-whereas he used to smile only-and when he saw dark clouds or wind, (the  signs of fear) were depicted on his face. I said: Messenger of Allah, I find people being  happy when they are the dark cloud in the hope that it would bring rain, but I find that  when you see that (the cloud) there is an anxiety on your face. He said: ‘Aisha, I am  afraid that there may be a calamity in it, for a people was afflicted with wind, when the  people saw the calamity they said: “It is a cloud which would give us rain” (Qur’an. xlvi.  24).

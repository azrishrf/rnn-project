17|4211|  Chapter: Stoning to death of jews and other Dhimmis in case of adultery.  Abdullah b. ‘Umar reported that a Jew and a Jewess were brought to Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) who had committed adultery. Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) came to the Jews and said: What do you find in Torah for one who  commits adultery? They said: We darken their faces and make them ride on the donkey  with their faces turned to the opposite direction (and their backs touching each other),  and then they are taken round (the city). He said: Bring Torah if you are truthful. They  brought it and recited it until when they came to the verse pertaining to stoning, the  person who was reading placed his hand on the verse pertaining to stoning, and read  (only that which was) between his hands and what was subsequent to that. Abdullah b.  Salim who was at that time with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  Command him (the reciter) to lift his hand. He lifted it and there was, underneath that,  the verse pertaining to stoning. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  pronounced judgment about both of them and they were stoned. Abdullah b. ‘Umar  said: I was one of those who stoned them, and I saw him (the Jew) protecting her (the  Jewess) with his body.

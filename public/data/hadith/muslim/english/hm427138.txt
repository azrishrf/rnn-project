42|7138|  Chapter: Every act of a believer is a blessing from Him.  Suhaib reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Strange are the  ways of a believer for there is good in every affair of his and this is not the case with  anyone else except in the case of a believer for if he has an occasion to feel delight, he  thanks (God), thus there is a good for him in it, and if he gets into trouble and shows  resignation (and endures it patiently), there is a good for him in it.

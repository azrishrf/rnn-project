7|2914|  Chapter: Excellence of kissing the black stone ;while circumambulating.  Abdullah b. Sarjis reported: I saw the bald one, i.e. ‘Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased  with him), kissing the Stone and saying: By Allah. I am kissing with full consciousness of  the fact that you are a stone and that you can neither do any harm nor good; and if I had  not seen Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) kissing you. I would not have  kissed you. The rest of the Hadith is the same.

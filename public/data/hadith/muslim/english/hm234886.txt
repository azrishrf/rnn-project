23|4886|  Chapter: Forbiddance of wine.         Anas b. Malik reported I was serving wine to Abu Talha, and Abu Dujana and Mu’adh b.  jabal amidst a group of Ansar when a visitor came to us and said There is a fresh news  ; the (verses) concerning the prohibition of liquor have been revealed.

Malik said: Whil  Khamr was declared unlawful, the common liquor of theirs was then a mixture of dry  dates and fresh dates.

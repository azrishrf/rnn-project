26|5376|  Chapter: The duty that one owes on the roadside is to respond the greeting of as-Salam-u- ‘Alaikum.  Abu Sa’id Khudri reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: Avoid  sitting on the paths. They (the Companions) said: Allah’s Messenger, we cannot help  but holding our meetings (in these paths) and discuss matters (there). Thereupon  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If you insist on holding meetings,  then give the path its due right. They said: What are its due rights? Upon this he said:  Lowering the gaze, refraining from doing harm, exchanging of greetings, commanding  of good and forbidding from evil.

4|1737|  Chapter: Desirability of reciting the Qur’an in a sweet voice.  Mu’awiya b. Qurra is reported to have heard ‘Abdullah b. Mughaffal as saying: I saw the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) reciting Surah Fath on his camel on the  day of the Conquest of Mecca. He (the narrator) said: Ibn Mughaffal recited it and  repeated it. Mu’awiya said: Had there been (no crowed of) people, I would have given a  practical demonstration of that which Ibn Mughaffal had mentioned from the Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him).

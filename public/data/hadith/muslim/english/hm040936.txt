4|936|  Chapter: Recitation in the morning prayer.  Jabir reported that Mu’adh b. jabal used to pray with the Apostle (may peace be upon  him), then came and led his people in prayer. One night he said the night prayer with  the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him). He then came to his people and led  them in prayer beginning with Surat al-Baqara. A man turned aside, pronounced the  taslim (salutation for concluding the prayer), then prayed alone and departed. The  people said to him: Have you become a hypocrite, so and so? He said: I swear by Allah  that I have not, but I will certainly go to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  and will inform (him) about this. He then came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, we look after camels used for watering and  work by day. Mu’idh said the night prayer with you. He then came and began with Surat  al-Baqara. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then turned to Mu’adh and  said: Are you there to (put the people) to trial? Recite such and recite such (and such a  surah). It is transmitted on the authority of Jabir, as told by Sufyan, that he (the Holy  Prophet) had said: “By the Sun and its morning brightness” (Sarah xci.), “By brightness”  (Surah xciii)”By the night when it spreads” (Surah xcii.), and “Glorify the name of thy  most high Lord” (Surah lxxxii.).

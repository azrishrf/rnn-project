30|5720|  Chapter: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is the best amongst people in  disposition and behaviour.  Anas b. Malik reported: I served the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) for  ten years, and, by Allah, he never said to me any harsh word, and he never said to me  about a thing as to why I had done that and as to why I had not done that. Abu Rabi’  has made this addition (in this narration): “The work which a servant should do.” There  is no mention of his words “By Allah”.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

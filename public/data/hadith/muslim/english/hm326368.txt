32|6368|  Chapter: The merit of one who resigns himself to the will of God calmly at the time of  the death of one’s son.         Abu Sa’id Khudri reported that a woman came to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) and said: Allah’s Messenger, men receive your instructions; kindly allocate at  your convenience a day for us also, on which we would come to you and you would  teach us what Allah has taught you. He said: You assemble on such and such a day.  They assembled and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to them and  taught them what Allah had taught him and he then said: No woman amongst you who  sends her three children as her forerunners (in the Hereafter) but they would serve him  as a protection against Hell-Fire. A woman said: What about two and two and two?  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Even if they are two and  two and two.  OF RELATIONSHIP

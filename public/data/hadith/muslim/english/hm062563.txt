6|2563|  Chapter: When an observer of fast is invited to a feast or someone fights with him, he should  say: “I am fasting”.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported: When any one of you gets up in the  morning in the state of fasting, he should neither use obscene language nor do any act  of ignorance. And if anyone slanders him or quarrels with him, he should say: “I am  fasting, I am fasting.”

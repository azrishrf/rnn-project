2|480|  Chapter: It is commendable to include forehead in washing the face and elbow and  ankle in washing the hands and feet, while performing ablution.  Abu Huraira reported the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: My people  would come to me on the Cistern and I would drive away persons (from it) just as a  person drives away other peopleâ€™s camels from his camels. They (the hearers) said:  Apostle of Allah, would you recognize us? He replied: Yea, you would have a mark  which other people will not have. You would come to me with a white blaze on your  foreheads and white marks on your feet because of the traces of ablution. A group  among you would be prevented from coming to me, and they would not meet me, and I  would say: O my Lord, they are my companions. Upon this an angel would reply to me  saying: Do you know what these people did after you.

35|6498|  Chapter: Merit of remembrance of Allah and calling Him, and nearness to Allah, the Exalted.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying that Allah,  the Exalted and Glorious, thus stated: I live in the thought of My servant as he thinks  about Me, and I am with him, as he remembers Me And if he remembers Me in his  heart, I also remember him in My Heart, and if he remembers Me in assembly I  remember him in the assembly, better than he (does that), and if he draws near Me by  the span of a palm I draw near him by the cubit, and if he draws near Me by the cubit I  draw near him by the space (covered by) two hands. And it he walks towards Me, I rush  towards him.  REPENTANCE AND SEEKING FORGIVENESS

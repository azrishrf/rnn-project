30|5783|  Chapter: Pertaining to the old age of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Anas b. Malik did not like that a person should pick out his white hair from his head or  beard, and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not dye, and there was  some whiteness in his hair at his chin, on his temples and very little on his head. This  hadith has been narrated on the authority of Muthanna through the same chain of  transmitters.           (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

11|3948|  Chapter: He who leaves behind property, that is for the heirs.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) as saying: He who leaves property, that is for the inheritors; and he who leaves  behind destitute children, then it is my responsibility (to look after them). This hadith has  been narrated on the authority of Shu’ba with the same chain of transmitters.

31|6111|  Chapter: Pertaining to the good which lies in accompanying the Ansar (Allah be pleased with  them).  Anas b. Malik reported: I set out along with Jabrir b. ‘Abdullah al-Bajali on a journey and  he used to serve me. I said to him: Don’t do that. Thereupon he said: I have seen Ansar  doing this with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I swore by Allah whenever  I accompany any one of the Ansar, I would serve him and Ibn Muthanni, and Ibn  Bashshir made this addition in their narrations: Jarir was older than Anas, and Ibn  Bashshir said: He was of a more advanced age as compared with Anas. Allah’s Apostle  (may peace be upon him) invoked blessings for the tribes of Ghifar and Aslam.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

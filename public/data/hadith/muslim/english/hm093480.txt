9|3480|  Chapter: It is forbidden to divorce the woman during her menses.  Ibn ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife while she was  in her menses. ‘Umar (Allah be pleased with him) asked Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) about that, and he said: Command him to take her back until she is pure and  then she enters the second menses and then becomes pure. Then either divorce her  (finally) or retain her.

5|2259|  Chapter: Miskin (poor man) is one who does not find enough to satisfy him and the people do  not consider him(needy) as to give him charity.  ‘Amr b. Dinar reported from Wahb b. Munabbih: I went to his house in San’a’ and he  offered me nuts grown in his house to eat. And his brother said: I heard Mu’awiya b.  Abu Sufyan saying that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  as saying, and then he made a mention (of a Hadith) like one mentioned above.

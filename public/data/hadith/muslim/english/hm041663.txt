4|1663|  Chapter: Exhortation to supplicate and make mention (of Allah) at the end of the night and its  acceptance by the Lord.  Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to exhort  (his Companions) to pray (at night) during Ramadan without commanding them to  observe it as an obligatory act, and say: He who observed the night prayer in Ramadan  because of faith and seeking his reward (from Allah), all his previous sins would be  forgiven. When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) died, this was the practice,  and it continued thus during Abu Bakr’s caliphate and the early part of ‘Umar’s  caliphate.

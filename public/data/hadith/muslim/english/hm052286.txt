5|2286|  Chapter: one is not rich because of the abundance of goods.         Abu Harb b. Abu al-Aswad reported on the authority of his father that Abu Musa al- Ash’ari sent for the reciters of Basra. They came to him and they were three hundred in  number. They recited the Qur’an and he said: You are the best among the inhabitants of  Basra, for you are the reciters among them. So continue to recite it. (But bear in mind)  that your reciting for a long time may not harden your hearts as were hardened the  hearts of those before you. We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and  severity to (Surah) Bara’at. I have, however, forgotten it with the exception of this which  I remember out of it: “If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he  would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but  dust.” And we used so recite a surah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat,  and I have forgotten it, but remember (this much) out of it: “Oh people who believe, why  do you say that which you do not practise” (lxi 2.) and “that is recorded in your necks as  a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection”  (xvii. 13).

9|3507|  Chapter: Ila and keeping away from wives.  ‘Aisha, daughter of Abu Bakr, and Hafsa who had prevailed upon all the wives of Allah’s  Prophet (way peace be upon him) for (pressing them for more money). I said:  Messenger of Allah, have you divorced them? He said: No. I said: Messenger of Allah, I  entered the mosque and found the Muslims playing with pebbles (absorbed in thought)  and saying: Allah’s Messenger has divorced his wives. Should I get down and inform  there that you have not divorced them? He said: Yes, if you so like. And I went on  talking to him until I (found) the signs of anger disappeared on his face and (his         seriousness was changed to a happy mood and as a result thereof) his face had the  natural tranquility upon it and he laughed and his teeth were the most charming (among  the teeth) of all people. Then Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) climbed down  and I also climbed down and catching hold of the wood of the palm-tree and Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) came down (with such ease) as if he was walking  on the ground, not touching anything with his hand (to get support). I said: Messenger of  Allah, you remained in your apartment for twenty-nine days. He said: (At times) the  month consists of twenty-nine days. I stood at the door of the mosque and I called out at  the top of my voice: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has not divorced  his wives (and it was on this occasion that this) verse was revealed: “And if any matter  pertaining to peace or alarm comes within their ken, they broadcast it; whereas, if they  would refer it to the Apostle and those who have been entrusted with authority amongst  them, those of them who are engaged in obtaining intelligence would indeed know  (what to do with) it” (iv 83). And it was I who understood this matter, and Allah revealed  the verse pertaining to option (given to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him in  regard to the retaining or divorcing of his wives).

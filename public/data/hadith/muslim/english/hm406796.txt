40|6796|  Chapter: The first group that would be admitted to Paradise would be like the face of the full  moon and the description of their qualities and their spouses.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The first  group of my Ummah to get into Paradise would be like a full moon in the night. Then  those who would be next to them; they would be like the most significantly glittering  stars in regard to brightness, then after them (others) in ranks. They would neither void  excrement, nor pass water, nor suffer from catarrh, nor would they spit. And their combs  would be made of gold, and the fuel of their braziers would be aloes and their sweat  would be musk and their form would be the form of one single person according to the  length of their father sixty cubits tall. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of  Ibn Abi Shaiba with a slight variation of wording.  INTIMATES

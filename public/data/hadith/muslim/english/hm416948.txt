41|6948|  Chapter: The Last Hour would not come until a person would pass by a grave and wish that he  should have been the occupant of that grave because of this calamity.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: By Him,  in Whose hand is my life, the world would not come to an end until a person would pass         by a grave, would roll over it and express the desire that he should be in the place of the  occupant of that grave not because of religious reasons but because of this calamity.

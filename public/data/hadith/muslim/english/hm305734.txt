30|5734|  Chapter: The mercy-and tenderness shown by Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  towards children, members of his family. and his humility and his sublime qualities.  Anas b. Malik reported: I have never seen anyone more kind to one’s family than Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Ibrahim was sent to the suburb of Medina for  suckling. He used to go there and we accompanied him. He entered the house, and it  was filled with smoke as his foster-father was a blacksmith. He took him (his son  Ibrihim) and kissed him and then came back. ‘Amr said that when Ibrihim died. Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Ibrihim is my son and he dies as a suckling  babe. He has now two foster-mothers who would complete his suckling period in  Paradise.             (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

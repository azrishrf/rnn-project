20|4636|  Chapter: The merit of Martyrdom.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira who said: The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) was asked: What deed could be an equivalent of Jihad in the  way of Allah, the Almighty and Exalted? He answered: You do not have the strength to  do that deed. The narrator said: They repeated the question twice or thrice. Every time  he answered: You do not have the strength to do it. When the question was asked for  the third time, he said: One who goes out for Jihad is like a person who keeps fasts,  stands in prayer (constantly), (obeying) Allah’s (behests contained in) the verses (of the  Qur’an), and does not exhibit any lassitude in fasting and prayer until the Mujihid returns  from Jihad in the way of Allah, the Exalted.

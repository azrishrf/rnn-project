40|6827|  Chapter: The haughty and the proud would Set into the fire of hell and the humble and meek  would get into Paradise.  Abu Sa’id reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Death would  be brought on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a white-coloured ram. Abu Kuraib  made this addition: Then it would be made to stand between the Paradise and the Hell.  So far as the rest of the hadith is concerned there is perfect agreement (between the  two narrators) and it would be said to the inmates of Paradise: Do you recognise this?  They would raise up their necks and look towards it and say: Yes, it is death. Then it  would be said to the inmates of Hell-Fire. Do you recognise this? And they would raise  up their necks and look and say: Yes, it is death. Then command would be given for  slaughtering that and then it would be said: O inmates of Paradise, there is an  everlasting life for you and no death. And then (addressing) to the inmates of the Hell- Fire, it would be said: O inmates of Hell-Fire, there is an everlasting living for you and  no death. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then recited this verse pointing  with his hand to this (material) world: “Warn them, this Day of dismay, and when their  affairs would be decided and they would be un-mindful and they believe not” (xix. 39).

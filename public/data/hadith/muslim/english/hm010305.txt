1|305|  Chapter: The beginning of Revelation to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him).  It is narrated on the authority of Jabir b. Abdullah that he heard the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) says: The wahi was intermitted for me for a small span of  time and while I was walking, and then the hadith like the one narrated by Yunus was  transmitted but with the exception of these words: I was terror-stricken till I fell on the  ground. Abu Salama said: Defilement means idols. After this the revelation was  speeded up and followed rapidly.

6|2424|  Chapter: The time for breaking the fast and ending of day.  Abdullah b. Abi Aufa (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We travelled with the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as he had been observing fast. When the  sun sank he said: So and so, get down and prepare barley meal for us. The rest of the  Hadith is the same.

5|2188|  Chapter: Getting of reward to Sadaqa for the dead given on his or her behalf.  Zainab, the wife of ‘Abdullah (b. Mas’ud), reported that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: O women, give sadaqa even though it be some of your  jewellery. She returned to ‘Abdullah and said: You are a person with empty hands,  whereas the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has commanded us to give  sadaqa, so better go to him and ask and if this will suffice for me; otherwise I shall give  it to someone else. ‘Abdullah said to me (his wife): You better go yourself. So I went and  there was another woman of the Ansar at the door of the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) having the same purpose as I had. Now Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) was invested with awe (so we did not like to knock). Then Bilal  came out and we said to him: Go to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  and inform him that there are two women at the door asking him whether it will serve  them to give sadaqa to their spouses and to orphans who are under their charge, but do  not inform him who we are. Bilal went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) and asked him (what these women had instructed him to ask). The Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) asked him who these women were. He (Bilal) said:  They are women from Ansar and Zainab. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) said: Which of the Zainabs? He said: The wife of ‘Abdullah. The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: There are two rewards for them, the  reward of kinship and the reward of Sadaqa.

30|5716|  Chapter: The valour and courage of Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Anas reported that there was consternation in Medina. The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) borrowed the horse from Abu Talha which was called Mandub. He  rode it and said: We have found no reason for consternation, and we have found it to be  (as quick as a torrent) of water.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

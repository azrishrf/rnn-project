1|271|  Chapter: Islam was initiated as something strange, and it would revert to its (old  position) of being strange, and it would concentrate between the two mosques.  It is narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar (‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar) that the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: Verily Islam started as something strange  and it would again revert (to its old position) of being strange just as it started, and it  would recede between the two mosques just as the serpent crawls back into its hole.

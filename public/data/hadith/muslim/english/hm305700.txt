30|5700|  Chapter: The cistern of our Apostle (may peace be upon him) and its characteristics.  ‘Abdullah reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would  be before you a Cistern (as extensive) as there is the distance between Jarba’ and         Adhruh and there would be jugs like stars in the sky; he who would come to that and  drink from it would never feel thirsty after that.

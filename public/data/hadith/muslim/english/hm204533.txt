20|4533|  Chapter: Obedience to the ruler is forbidden in matters sinful, but is otherwise  obligatory.  It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn â€˜Umar that the Holy Prophet (may peace be  upon him) said: It is obligatory upon a Muslim that he should listen (to the ruler  appointed over him) and obey him whether he likes it or not, except that he is ordered to  do a sinful thing. If he is ordered to do a sinful act, a Muslim should neither, listen to him  nor should he obey his orders.

39|6699|  Chapter: Description of the day of judgement, paradise and hell.  Abdullah b. Mas’ud reported that a Jew scholar came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace he  upon him) and said. Muhammad, or Abu al-Qasim, verify, Allah, the Exalted and  Glorious, would carry the Heavens on the Day of Judgment upon one finger and earths  upon one finger and the mountains and trees upon one finger and the ocean and moist  earth upon one finger-in fact the whole of the creation upon one finger, and then He  would stir them and say: I am your Lord, I am your Lord. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) smiled testifying what that scholar had said. He then recited  this verse: “And they honour not Allah with the honour due to Him; and the whole earth  will be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens in His right hand. Glory  be to Him I and highly Exalted is Re above what they associate (with Him)” (xxxix. 67).  PARADISE AND HELL

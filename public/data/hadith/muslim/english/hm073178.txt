7|3178|  Chapter: Eminence of Medina, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) showered  blessings upon it. Its sacredness and unlawfulness of hunting and lopping of trees and  demarcation its precincts.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: When we came to Medina, and it was an  unhealthy, uncongenial place, Abu Bakr fell sick and Bilal also fell sick; and when  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw the illness of his Companions he said:  O Allah, make Medina as congenial to us as you made Mecca congenial or more than  that; make it conducive to health, and bless us in its sa’ and in its mudd, and transfer its  fever to al-juhfa.

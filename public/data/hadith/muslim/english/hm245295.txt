24|5295|  Chapter: It Is forbidden to add false hair to one’s head or to pluck the eyebrow or to  separate the teeth.  Asma’, daughter of Abu Bakr, reported that a woman came to Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) and said: I have a daughter who has been newly wedded. She had  an attack of smallpox and thus her hair had fallen; should I add false hair to her head?  Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah has cursed the  woman who adds some false hair and the woman who asks for it.

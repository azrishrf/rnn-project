1|26|  Chapter: Relating to the Command for Belief In Allah and His Prophet and the laws of  Islam and inviting (people to) them.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Said al-Khudri that when the delegation of the tribe  of Abdul-Qais came to the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him), (its members)  said: Apostle of Allah, may God enable us to lay down our lives for you, which beverage  is good for us? He (the Prophet) said: (Not to speak of beverages, I would lay stress)  that you should not drink in the wine jars. They said: Apostle of Allah, may God enable  us to lay down our lives for you, do you know what Al-Naqir is? He (the Holy Prophet)  replied: Yes, it is a stump which you hollow out in the middle, and added: Do not use  gourd or receptacle (for drink). Use water-skin the mouth of which is tied with a thong  (for this purpose).

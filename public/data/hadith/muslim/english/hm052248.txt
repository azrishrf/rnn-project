5|2248|  Chapter: The most excellent Sadaqa is that which is given when one is healthy.  Abu Huraira reported that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said:  Seven are (the persons) whom Allah would give protection with His Shade on the Day  when there would be no shade but that of Him (i.e. on the Day of Judgment, and they  are): a just ruler, a youth who grew up with the worship of Allah; a person whose heart  is attached to the mosques; two persons who love and meet each other and depart from  each other for the sake of Allah; a man whom a beautiful woman of high rank seduces  (for illicit relation), but he (rejects this offer by saying): “I fear Allah” ; a person who gives  charity and conceals it (to such an extent) that the right hand does not know what the  left has given: and a person who remembered Allah in privacy and his eyes shed tears.

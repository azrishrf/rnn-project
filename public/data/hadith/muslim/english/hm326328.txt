Hizam happened  to pass by people, the farmers of Syria, who had been made to stand in the sun. He         said: What is the matter with them? They said: They have been detained for Jizya.  Thereupon Hisham said: I bear testimony to the fact that I heard Allahâ€™s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah would torment those who torment people in  the world.  OF RELATIONSHIP

7|3156|  Chapter: Eminence of Medina, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) showered  blessings upon it.

Sa’d reported that Sa’d rode to his castle in al-‘Aqiq and found a slave cutting  down the trees, or beating off their leaves, so he stripped him off his belongings. When  Sa’d returned, there came to him the masters of the slave and negotiated with him  asking him to return to their slave or to them what he had taken from their slave,  whereupon he said: God forbid that I should return anything which Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) has given me as spoil, and refused to return anything to  them.

31|6062|  Chapter: The merits of Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him).  Anas reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) visited us and there was none  else (in the house) but I, my mother and my mother’s sister Umm Haram. My mother  said to him: Allah’s Messenger, here is a small servant of yours, invoke blessings of  Allah upon him. And he invoked blessings for me (that I should be bestowed upon)  every good and this was what he (said) at the end of what be supplicated for me: O  Allah, make an increase in his wealth, and progeny, and confer blessings (upon him) in  (each one) of them.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

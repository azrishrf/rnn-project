4|1797|  Chapter: Reciting the Qur’an leisurely and distinctively and abstaining from reciting it  too hurriedly, and permission to recite two suras of more than two in a Rak’ah.  Abu Ishaq reported: I saw a man asking Aswad b. Yazid who taught the Qur’an in the  mosque: How do you recite the verse (fahal min muddakir) whether (the word muddakir)  Is with (d) or (dh)? He (Aswad) said: It was with (d). I heard Abdullah b. Mas’ud saying  that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) reciting (muddakir)  with (d).

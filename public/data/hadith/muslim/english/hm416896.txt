41|6896|  Chapter: The turmoil would come like rainfall.  Abu Bakra reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There  would soon be turmoil. Behold! there would be turmoil in which the one who would be  seated would be better than one who would stand and the one who would stand would  be better than one who would run. Behold! when the turmoil comes or it appears, the  one who has camel should stick to his camel and he who has sheep or goat should stick  to his sheep and goat and he who has land should stick to the land. A person said:  ‘Allah’s Messenger, what is your opinion about one who has neither camel nor sheep  nor land? Thereupon, he said: He should take hold of his sword and beat its edge with  the help of stone and then try to find a way of escape. O Allah, I have conveyed (Thy  Message); O Allah, I have conveyed (Thy Message); O Allah, I have conveyed (Thy  Message). A person said: Allah’s Messenger, what is your opinion it I am drawn to a  rank in spite of myself, or in one of the groups and made to march and a man strikes  with his sword or there comes an arrow and kills me? Thereupon he said: He will bear  the punishment of his sin and that of yours and he would be one amongst the denizens  of Hell.

23|4884|  Chapter: Forbiddance of wine.  Anas b. Malik reported: I was standing amongst the uncles of my tribe serving them  Fadikh while I was the youngest of them, when a person came and said: Verily the use  of liquor has been prohibited. They said: Anas, spill it away. So I spilt it. He (one of the  narrators. Sulaiman Taimi) said that he asked Anas what that was (the Fadikh). He said:  It had been prepared from unripe and ripe dates. Abu Bakr b. Anas said: It was their  liquor in those days. Sulaiman said: A person narrated it to me from Anas b. Malik that  he had said so.

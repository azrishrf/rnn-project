39|6705|  Chapter: Description of the day of judgement, paradise and hell.  Abdullah b. Miqsam reported that he saw Abdullah b. Umar as he narrated Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would  take in His hand His Heavens and His Earth, and would say: I am Allah.

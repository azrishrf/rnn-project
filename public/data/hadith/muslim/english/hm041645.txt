4|1645|  Chapter: Forenoon prayer should be offered when it is sufficiently hot.  Anas b. Sirin reported: I asked Ibn ‘Umar to tell me about the practice of the Holy  Prophet (may peace be upon him) in regard to two rak’ahs before the dawn prayer:  Should I make lengthy recitation in them? He said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) used to observe, the night prayer in pairs and then made the number odd  by observing one rak’ah. I said: I am not asking you about it. He said: You are a bulky  man, will you not show me the patience to narrate to you the Hadith completely? The  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to observe the night prayer in pairs  and then made the number odd by observing one rak’ah, and then he observed two  rak’ahs before dawn quite close to the call for prayer (Khalaf said: “Did you see [yourself  the Holy Prophet observing] the two rak’ahs before the dawn?” and he made no  mention of prayer.)

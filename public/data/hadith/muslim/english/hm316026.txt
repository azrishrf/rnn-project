31|6026|  Chapter: The merits of ‘Abdullah b. Mas’ud and that of his mother (Allah be pleased with them).         This hadith has been reported on the authority of Abu Bakr b. Abu Shaiba and Abu  Kuraib, and both of them said: Abu Mu’awiya narrated to us from A’mash on the  authority of Jarir and Waki’, and in a narration of Abu Bakr transmitted on the authority  of Abu Mu’awiya the mention of Mu’adh has preceded Ubayy’s, and in the narration  transmitted on the authority of Abu Kuraib, the name of Ubayy preceded Mu’ddh’s. This  tradition has been transmitted on the authority of Shulba through A’mash, but there is a  difference of order of the four.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

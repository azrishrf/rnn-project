9|3552|  Chapter: It is obligatory to abstain from adornment during the ‘Idda period, but  mourning beyond three days is prohibited.  Umm ‘Atiyya (‘Allah be pleased with her) said: We were forbidden to observe mourning  for the dead beyond three days except in the case of husband (where it is permissible)  for four months and ten days, and (that during this period) we should neither use  collyrium nor touch perfume, nor wear dyed clothes, but concession was given to a  woman when one of us was purified of our courses to make use of a little incense or  scent.

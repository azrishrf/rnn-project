5|2285|  Chapter: one is not rich because of the abundance of goods.  Ibn Abbas reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If there  were for the son of Adam a valley full of riches, he would long to possess another one  like it, and Ibn Adam does not feel satiated but with dust. (14:13) And Allah returns to  him who returns (to him). (14:14) Ibn Abbas said: I do not know whether it is from the  Qur’an or not; and in the narration transmitted by Zuhair it was said: I do not know  whether it is from the Qur’an, and he made no mention of Ibn Abbas.

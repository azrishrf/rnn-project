1|162|  Chapter: Major sins and the gravest among these.  It is narrated on the authority of ‘Abdullah b. Amr b. al-‘As that the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) observed: Abusing one’s parents is one of the major sins.  They (the hearers) said: Messenger of Allah, does a man abuse his parents too? He         (the Holy Prophet) replied: Yes, one abuses the father of another man, who in turn  abuses his father. One abuses his mother and he in turn abuses his (the formers)  mother.

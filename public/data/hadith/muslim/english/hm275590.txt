27|5590|  Chapter: Disapproval of naming the vine as a Karm.  ‘Alqama b. Wa’il reported, from his father, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  having said: Do not say al-karm (for the word vine) but say al-habala (that is grape).  This hadith has been reported by Alqama b. Wa’il on the authority of his father with a  different chain of transmitters and with a slight variation of wording.

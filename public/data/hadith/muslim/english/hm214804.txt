21|4804|  Chapter: Permissibility of eating the flesh of the hare.  Anas b. Malik reported: We chased a hare at Marr az-Zahrin (a valley near Mecca).  They (my companions) ran, but felt exhausted; I also tried until I caught hold of it. I  brought it to Abu Talha. He slaughtered it and sent its haunch and two hind legs to  Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) through me; and he accepted them. This  hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Yahya with a slight change of wording.

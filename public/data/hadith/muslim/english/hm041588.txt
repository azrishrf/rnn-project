Shaqiq al-‘Uqaili reported: I asked ‘Aisha about the prayer of the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: The Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) would observe prayer (Nafl) in a standing position as well as in a  sitting position, and when he commenced the prayer in a standing position, he bowed in  this very position, and when he commenced the prayer in a sitting position, he bowed in  this very position.

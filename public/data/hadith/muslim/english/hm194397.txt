19|4397|  Chapter: Removal of the idols from the vicinity of the Ka’ba.  It has been narrated by Ibn Abdullah who said: The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon  him) entered Mecca. There were three hundred and sixty idols around the Ka’ba. He  began to thrust them with the stick that was in his hand saying: “Truth has come and  falsehood has vanished. Lo! falsehood was destined to vanish” (xvii. 8). Truth has  arrived, and falsehood can neither create anything from the beginning nor can It restore  to life

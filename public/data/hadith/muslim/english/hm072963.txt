7|2963|  Chapter: It is excellent that the aged and the weak, especially among the women,  should hasten from Muzdalifa to Mina at the latter part of the night before the people  moving in multitude. and excellence of staying there for others until they observe the  dawn prayer at Muzdalifa.         Ibn Shawwal (the freed slave of Umm Habiba) reported that he went to Umm Habiba  (the wife of Allah’s Apostle) who informed him that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) sent her from Muzdalifa during the night.

18|4249|  Chapter: Judgment is to be pronounced on evidence, and one who is eloquent in his plea (may  win the case).  Umm Salama, the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), reported that  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) heard the clamour of contenders at the  door of his apartment. He went to them, and said: I am a human being and the  claimants bring to me (the dispute) and perhaps some of them are more eloquent than  the others. I judge him to be on the right, and thus decide in his favour. So he whom I,  by my judgment, (give the undue share) out of the right of a Muslim, I give him a portion  of Fire; he may burden himself with it or abandon it.

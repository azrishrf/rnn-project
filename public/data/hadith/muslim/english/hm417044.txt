41|7044|  Chapter: Approach of the Last Hour.  This hadith has been reported by Sahl b. Sa’d that he heard Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) as saying: I and the Last Hour are (close to each other) like this  (and he, in order to explain it) pointed (by joining his) forefinger, (one) next to the thumb  and the middle finger (together).

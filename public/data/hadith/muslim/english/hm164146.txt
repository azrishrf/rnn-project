16|4146|  Chapter: When anyone attacks the life of a person, or his limb and the victim wards off the  attack and in self-defence either the life of the assailant is lost or his limb broken, there would be  no penalty on the victim.         Safwan b. Ya’la reported that a person bit the arm of the servant of Ya’la b. Munya. He  pulled it and his fore-tooth fell. The matter was referred to Allah’s Apostle (may peace  be upon him) and he turned it down and said: Did you intend to bite his hand, as the  camel bites?  MURDERS, FIGHTING, REQUITAL

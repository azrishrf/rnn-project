4|1753|  Chapter: Excellence of the reciting of the Qur’an by one who is more skilled and  proficient before one who is inferior to him.  ‘Abdullah (b.

One of the persons among  the people said: By Allah, this is not how it has been sent down. I said: Woe upon you !  By Allah, I recited it to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he said to  me: You have (recited) it well. I was talking with him (the man who objected to my  recitation) that I sensed the smell of wine from him. So I said to him. Do you drink wine  and belie the Book (of Allah)? You would not depart till I would whip you. So I lashed  him according to the prescribed punishment (for the offence of drinking wine).

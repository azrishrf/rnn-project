20|4513|  Chapter: Acceptance of gifts on the part of state officers is forbidden.         It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Humaid as-Sa’idi that the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) appointed a man in charge of Sadaqa (authorising him  to receive charity from the people on behalf of the State). He came (back to the Holy  prophet) with a large number of things and started saying: This is for you and this has  been presented to me as a gift. Here follows the tradition that has gone before except  that ‘Urwa (one of the narrators in the chain of transmitters) asked Abu Humaid: Did you  hear it from the Messenger of Allah (himself) (may peace be upon him)? He replied: My  ears heard it from his mouth.

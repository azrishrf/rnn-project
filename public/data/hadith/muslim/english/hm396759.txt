39|6759|  Chapter: The mischief of satan in the Muslim society and sending his detachments for the  creation of turmoil, and there is a devil attached to every person.  ‘Aisha the wife of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), reported that one day  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came out of her (apartment) during the  night and she felt jealous. Then he came and he saw me (in what agitated state of  mind) I was. He said: ‘Aisha, what has happened to you? Do you feel jealous?  Thereupon she said: How can it he (that a woman like me) should not feel jealous in  regard to a husband like you. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  said: It was your devil who had come to you, and she said: Allah’s Messenger, is there  along with me a devil? He said: Yes. I said: Is devil attached to everyone? He said: Yes.  I (‘Aisha) again said: Allah’s Messenger, is it with you also? He said: Yes, but my Lord  has helped me against him and as such I am absolutely safe from his mischief.  PARADISE AND HELL

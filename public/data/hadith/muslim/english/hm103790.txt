10|3790|  Chapter: Command of killing dogs and then its abrogation, and prohibition of keeping them but  for hunting and protection of lands or cattle or like that.  Hudhaifa (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  as saying: A person died and he entered Paradise. It was said to him What (act) did you         do? (Either he recalled it himself or he was made to recall), he said I used to enter into  transactions with people and I gave respite to the insolvent and did not show any  strictness in case of accepting a coin or demanding cash payment. (For these acts of  his) he was granted pardon. Abu Mas’ud said: I heard this from Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him).

Abu Salama b. ‘Abd al-Rahman reported that Jabir told him that he had observed the  prayer in danger with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) (first) led one of the two groups in two rak’ah of  prayer. and then led the second group in two rak’ah of prayer.

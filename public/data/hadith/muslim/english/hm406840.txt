40|6840|  Chapter: The haughty and the proud would Set into the fire of hell and the humble and meek  would get into Paradise.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Two are  the types amongst the denizens of Hell, the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox  and they flog people with their help. (The second one) the women who would be naked  in spite of their being dressed, who are seduced (to wrong paths) and seduce others  with their hair high like humps. These women would not get into Paradise and they  would not perceive the odour of Paradise, although its fragrance can be perceived from  such and such distance (from great distance).  INTIMATES

22|4877|  Chapter: It is forbidden to sacrifice the animal for anyone besides Allah, the Exalted,  and curse upon one who does it.  Abu Tufail reported: We said to ‘Ali b. Abi Talib: Inform us about something which  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) told you in secret, whereupon he said: He  told me nothing in secret which he bid from people, but I heard him say: Allah cursed  him who sacrificed for anyone besides Allah; and cursed him who accommodated an  innovator; and Allah cursed him who cursed his parents and Allah cursed him who  changed the boundary lines (of the land possessed by him).

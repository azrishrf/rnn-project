31|6103|  Chapter: The merits of the Ansar (Allah be pleased with them).  Anas b. Malik reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The  Ansar are my family and my trusted friends and the people would increase in number  whereas they (the Ansar) would become less and less, so appreciate the deeds of  those from amongst them who do good and overlook their failings.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

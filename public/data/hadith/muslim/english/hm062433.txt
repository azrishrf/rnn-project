6|2433|  Chapter: It is forbidden to observe uninterrupted fasting.  Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) was observing prayer during Ramadan. I came and stood by his side. Then  another man came and he stood likewise till we became a group. When the Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him) perceived that we were behind him, he lightened the  prayer. He then went to his abode and observed such (a long) prayer (the like of which)  he never observed with us. When it was morning we said to him: Did you perceive us  during the night? Upon this he said: Yes, it was this (realisation) that induced me to do  that which I did. He (the narrator) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) began to observe Saum Wisal at the end of the month (of Ramadan), and some  persons among his Companions began to observe this uninterrupted fast, whereupon  the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What about such persons who         observe uninterrupted fasts? You are not like me. By Allah. if the month were  lengthened for me, I would have observed Saum Wisal, so that those who act with an  exaggeration would (have been obliged) to abandon their exaggeration.1501

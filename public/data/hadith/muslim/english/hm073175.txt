7|3175|  Chapter: Eminence of Medina, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) showered  blessings upon it. Its sacredness and unlawfulness of hunting and lopping of trees and  demarcation its precincts.  Abu Sa’id Maula al-Mahri reported that he came to Abu Sa’id al-Khudri during the nights  (of the turmoil) of al-Barrah, and sought his advice about leaving Medina, and  complained of the high prices prevailing therein and his large family, and informed him  that he could not stand the hardships of Medina and its rugged surrounding. He said to  him: Woe to you; I will not advise you to do it, for I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) as saying: No one will endure hardships of Medina without my being an  intercessor or a witness on his behalf on the Day of Resurrection), if he is a Muslim.

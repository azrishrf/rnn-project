10|3830|  Chapter: Conversion of currency and selling of gold for silver on the spot.  It is narrated on the authority of Humaid that Anas b. Malik was asked about the  earnings of the cupper. He said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got         himself cupped. His cupper was Abu Taiba and he (the Holy Prophet) commanded to  give him two sa’s of corn. He (the Holy Prophet) talked with the members of his family  and they lightened the burden of Kharaj (tax) from him (i.e. they made remission in the  charges of their own accord). He (Allah’s Apostle) said: The best (treatment) which you  take is cupping, or it is the best of your treatments.

24|5261|  Chapter: Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.  ‘Aisha reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited me and I had a  shelf with a thin cloth curtain hanging over it and on which there were portraits. No  sooner did he see it than he tore it and the colour of his face underwent a change and  he said: ‘Aisha, the most grievous torment from the Hand of Allah on the Day of  Resurrection would be for those who imitate (Allah) in the act of His creation. ‘Aisha  said: We tore it into pieces and made a cushion or two cushions out of that.

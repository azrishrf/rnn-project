30|5749|  Chapter: The nearness of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) to the people and their  seeking blessings from his (and his possessions).  Anas b. Malik reported that when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had  completed his dawn prayer, the servants of Medina came to him with utensils containing  water, and no utensil was brought in which he did not dip his hand; and sometime they  came in the cold dawn (and he did not feel reluctant in acceding to their request even in  the cold weather) and dipped his hand in them.

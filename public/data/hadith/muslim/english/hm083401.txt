8|3401|  Chapter: Kitab Al-Rada’a-Book pertaining to fosterage.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: My foster uncle came to me and sought  permission (to enter the house), but I refused him permission until I had solicited the  opinion of Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon him). When Allah’s Messenger (May  peace be upon him) came, I said to him: My foster-uncle sought my permission to (enter  the house), but I did not permit him, whereupon Allah’s Messenger (May peace be upon  him) said: You better admit your uncle (into the house). I (‘Aisha) said: It was the  woman who suckled me and not the man. (But he) said: He is your uncle, admit him.

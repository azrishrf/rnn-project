Malik said: I stood up on a mat (belonging to us) which had turned  dark on account of its long use. I sprinkled water over it (in order to soften it), and the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood upon it, and I and an orphan  formed a row behind him (the Holy Prophet) and the old woman was behind us, and the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led us in two rakâ€™ahs of prayer and then  went back.

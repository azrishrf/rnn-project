41|6994|  Chapter: Story of Ibn Sayyid.  Abu Sa’id reported: I accompanied Ibn Sayyad to Mecca and he said to me: What I  have gathered from people is that they think that I am Dajjal. Have you not heard Allah’s  Messenger (may peace upon him) as saying: He will have no children, I said: Yes, of  course. Thereupon he said: But I have children. Have you not heard Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) as saying: He would not enter Mecca and Medina? I said:  Yes, of course. Thereupon he said I have been once in Medina and now I intend to go  to Mecca. And he said to me at the end of his talk: By Allah: I know his place of birth his  abode where he is just now. He (Abu Sa’id) said: This caused confusion in my mind (in  regard to his identity).

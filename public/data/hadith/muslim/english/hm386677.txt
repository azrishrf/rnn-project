38|6677|  Chapter: Not known.  Zaid b. Arqam reported: We set out on a journey along with Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) in which we faced many hardships. ‘Abdullah b. Ubayy said to his  friends: Do not give what you have in your possession to those who are with Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) until they desert him. Zubair said: That is the  reciting of that person who recited as min haulahu (from around him) and the other  reciting is man haulahia (who are around him).And in this case when we would return to  Medina the honourable would drive out the meaner there-from (lxiv. 8). I came to Allah’s  Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed him about that and he sent someone to  ‘Abdullah b. Ubayy and he asked him whether he had said that or not. He took an oath  to the fact that he had not done that and told that it was Zaid who had stated a lie to  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him).Zaid said: I was much perturbed because  of this until this verse was revealed attesting my truth: “When the hypocrites come” (lxiii.  1). Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then called them in order to seek  forgiveness for them, but they turned away their heads as if they were hooks of wood  fixed in the wall (lxiii. 4), and they were in fact apparently good-looking persons.

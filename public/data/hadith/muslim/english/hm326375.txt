32|6375|  Chapter: When Allah loves a servant, his fellow-servants also begin to love him.  Suhail b. Abi Salih, reported: We were in Arafa that there happened to pass Umar b.  Abd al-‘Aziz and he was the Amir of Hajj. People stood up in order to catch a glimpse of  him. I said to my father: Father, I think that Allah loves Umar b. Abd al-‘Aziz. He said:  How is it? I said: It is because of the love in people’s heart for him. Thereupon he said:  By One Who created your father, I heard Abu Huraira narrating from Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) a hadith like one transmitted on the authority of Suhail.

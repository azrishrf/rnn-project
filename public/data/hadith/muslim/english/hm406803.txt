40|6803|  Chapter: The everlasting bliss for the inmates of Paradise.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri and Abu Huraira both reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: There would be an announcer (in Paradise) who would make this  announcement: Verily I there is in store for you (everlasting) health and that you should  never fall ill and that you live (for ever) and do not die at all. And that you would remain  young and never grow old. And that you would always live in affluent circumstances and  never become destitute, as words of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, are: “And it would  be announced to them: This is the Paradise. You have been made to inherit it for what  you used to do”.(VII; 43)  INTIMATES

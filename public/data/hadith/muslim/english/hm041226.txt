Thauban reported: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) finished his  prayer, he begged forgiveness three times and said: O Allah ! Thou art Peace, and  peace comes from Thee; Blessed art Thou, O Possessor of Glory and Honour. Walid  reported: I said to Auza’i: How Is the seeking of forgiveness? He replied: You should  say: I beg forgiveness from Allah, I beg forgiveness from Allah.”

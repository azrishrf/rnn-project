20|4519|  Chapter: Obedience to the ruler is forbidden in matters sinful, but is otherwise  obligatory.  It has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) said: Whoso obeys me obeys God; and whose disobeys me  disobeys God. Whoso obeys my commander obeys me, and whoso disobeys my  commander disobeys me.

10|3874|  Chapter: He who took something as loan and made its payment back, over and above that (19  approved) and best among you is one who is best in making payment.  Abu Nadra reported: I asked Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) about the  conversion (of gold and silver for silver and gold). We said: Is it hand to hand  exchange? I said: Yes. whereupon he said: There is no harm in it. I informed Abu Sa’id  about it, telling him that I had asked Ibn ‘Abbas about it and he said: Is it hand to hand  exchange? I said: Yes, whereupon he said: There is no harm in it. He (the narrator)  said, or he said like it: We will soon write to him, and he will not give you this fatwa  (religious verdict). He said: By Allah, someone of the boy-servants of Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) brought dates, but he refused to accept them (on the plea)  that those did not seem to be of the dates of our land. He said: Something had  happened to the dates of our land, or our dates. So I got these dates (in exchange by  giving) excess (of the dates of our land), whereupon he said: You made an addition for  getting the fine dates (in exchange) which tantamounts, to interest; don’t do that (in  future). Whenever you find some doubt (as regards the deteriorating quality of) your  dates, sell them, and then buy the dates that you like.

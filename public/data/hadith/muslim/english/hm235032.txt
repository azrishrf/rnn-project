23|5032|  Chapter: It is desirable to circulate water or milk (in an assembly) from the right-hand side of  the one who serves.  Anas b. Malik reported that there was brought to Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) a cup of milk mixed with water, while there was on his right a desert Arab and  on his left Abu Bakr.

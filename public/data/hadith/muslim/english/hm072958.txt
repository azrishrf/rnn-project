7|2958|  Chapter: It is excellent that the aged and the weak, especially among the women,  should hasten from Muzdalifa to Mina at the latter part of the night before the people  moving in multitude. and excellence of staying there for others until they observe the  dawn prayer at Muzdalifa.  ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Sauda (the wife of the Holy Prophet) who  was bulky sought the permission of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the  night of Muzdalifa to move from (that place) ahead of him and before the multitude (set  forth). He (Allah’s Apostle) gave her the permission. So she set forth before his (Holy  Prophet’s) departure. But we stayed there until it was dawn and we moved on, when he  departed. And if I were to seek the permission of Allah’s Messenger.(may peace be  upon him) as Sauda had sought permission, I could have also gone with his permission  and it would have been better for me than that for which I was happy.

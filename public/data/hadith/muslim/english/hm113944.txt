11|3944|  Chapter: He who leaves behind property, that is for the heirs.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the body of a dead person  having burden of debt upon him was brought to Allahâ€™s Messenger(may peace be upon  him) he would ask whether he had left property enough to clear off his debt, and if the  property left had been sufficient for that (purpose), he observed funeral prayer for him,  otherwise he said (to his companions): You observe prayer for your companion. But  when Allah opened the gateways of victory for him, he said: I am nearer to the believers  than themselves, so if anyone dies leaving a debt, its payment is my responsibility, and  if anyone leaves a property, it goes to his heirs.

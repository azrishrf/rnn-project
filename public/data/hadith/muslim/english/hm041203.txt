4|1203|  Chapter: Prostration while reciting the Qur’an.  Ibn ‘Umar reported that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat for  tashahhud he placed his left hand on his left knee and his right hand on his right knee  and he raised his right finger, which is next to the thumb, making supplication in this         way, and he stretched his left hand on his left knee. Another version on the authority of  Ibn Umar says: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat for  tashahhud, he placed his left hand on his left knee and placed his right hand on his right  knee, and he formed a ring like (fifty-three) and pointed with his finger of attestation.

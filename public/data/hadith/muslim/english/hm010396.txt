1|396|  Chapter: Pertaining to the words of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him): “I  would be the first among people to Intercede in the Paradise and among the Apostles I  would have the largest following”.         Abu Zubair heard Jabir b. Abdullah reporting it from the Apostle of Allah (may peace be  upon him): For every apostle was a prayer with which he prayed (to his Lord) for his  Ummah, but I have reserved my prayer for the intercession of my Ummah on the Day of  Resurrection.

10|3893|  Chapter: Hoarding of foodstuff is forbidden.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) bought a camel from me for two ‘uqiyas and a dirham or two dirhams. As  he reached Sirar (a village near Medina), he commanded a cow to be slaughtered and it  was slaughtered, and they ate of that, and as he (the Holy Prophet) reached Medina he  ordered me to go to the mosque and offer two rak’ahs of prayer, and he measured for  me the price of the camel and even made an excess payment to me.

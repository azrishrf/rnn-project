4|1916|  Chapter: What is to be recited in the Jumu’a prayer ?.  Suhail reported on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) said: When you observe prayer after (the two obligatory rak’ahs) of  Jumu’a, you should observe four rak’ahs (and ‘Amr in his narration has made this  addition that Ibn Idris said this on the authority of Suhail): And if you are in a hurry on  account of something, you should observe two rak’ahs in the mosque and two when you  return (to your house).

4|1467|  Chapter: Compensation of the missed prayer and excellence of observing it promptly.  Hafs b. ‘Asim said: I accompanied Ibn ‘Umar on the road to Mecca and he led us in two  rak’ahs at the noon prayer, then he went forward and we too went along with him to a  place where he alighted, and he sat and we sat along with him, and he cast a glance to  the side where he said prayer and he saw people standing and asked: What are they  doing? I said: They are engaged in glorifying Allah, offering Sunnah prayer. He said: If I  had done so I would have perfected my prayer; O my nephew ! I accompanied the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on a journey, and he made no addition to  two rak’ahs, till Allah called him. I accompanied Abu Bakr and he made no addition to  two rak’ahs till Allah caused him to die. I accompanied ‘Umar and he made no addition  to two rak’ahs till Allah caused him to die. I accompanied ‘Uthman and he made no  addition to two rak’ahs, till Allah caused him to die, and Allah has said: “There is a  model pattern for you in the Messenger of Allah” (al-Qur’an, xxxiii. 21).

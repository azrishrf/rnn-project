31|6163|  Chapter: Meaning of the saying of the Prophet (may peace be upon him): “No person would  survive after a century who is living by this time of mine”.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying one  mouth before his death (or something like it): None amongst the created beings who  had been living by that time (during the lifetime of Allah’s Apostle)... ‘Abd al-Rahman  has interpreted these words of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as: The ages  (of the people) would be diminished.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

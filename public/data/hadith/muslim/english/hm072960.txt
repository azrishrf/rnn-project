7|2960|  Chapter: It is excellent that the aged and the weak, especially among the women,  should hasten from Muzdalifa to Mina at the latter part of the night before the people  moving in multitude. and excellence of staying there for others until they observe the  dawn prayer at Muzdalifa.  ‘Aisha said: I wish I had sought permission from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) as Sauda had sought, and observed the dawn prayer at Mina and stoned at al- Jamra before the people had come there. It was said to ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with         her): Did Sauda seek permission from him (the Holy Prophet)? She said: Yes. She was  a bulky lady and so she sought permission from Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) (to proceed to mina from Muzdalifa ahead of him), and he granted her permission.

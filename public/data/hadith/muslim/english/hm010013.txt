1|13|  Chapter: Concerning Iman by which a person would enter Heaven.  It is narrated on the authority of Abu Ayyub that a man came to the Prophet (may peace  be upon him) and said: Direct me to a deed which draws me near to Paradise and takes  me away from the Fire (of Hell). Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: You worship Allah  and never associate anything with Him, establish prayer, and pay Zakat, and do good to  your kin. When he turned his back, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  remarked: If he adheres to what he has been ordered to do, he would enter Paradise.

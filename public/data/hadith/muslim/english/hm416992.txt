41|6992|  Chapter: Story of Ibn Sayyid.  Abu Sa’id reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) met him (Ibn  Sayyad) and so did Abu Bakr and ‘Umar on some of the roads of Medina. Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Do you bear testimony to the fact that I am  the Messenger of Allah? Thereupon he said: Do you bear testimony to the fact that I am  the messenger of Allah? Thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I  affirm my faith in Allah and in His Angels and in His Books, and what do you see? He  said: I see the throne over water. Whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon         him) said: You see the throne of Iblis upon the water, and what else do you see? He  said: I see two truthful and a liar or two liars and one truthful. Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Leave him He has been confounded.

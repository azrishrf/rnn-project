20|4496|  Chapter: The merits of a just ruler and the demerits of a tyrant ruler.  It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Umar that the Holy Prophet (May be upon  him) said: Beware, every one of you is a shepherd and every one is answerable with  regard to his flock. The Caliph is a shepherd over the people and shall be questioned  about his subjects (as to how he conducted their affairs). A man is a guardian over the  members of his family and shall be questioned about them (as to how he looked after  their physical and moral well-being). A woman is a guardian over the household of her  husband and his children and shall be questioned about them (as to how she managed  the household and brought up the children). A slave is a guardian over the property of  his master and shall be questioned about it (as to how he safeguarded his trust).  Beware, every one of you is a guardian and every one of you shall be questioned with  regard to his trust.

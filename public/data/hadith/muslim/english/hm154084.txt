15|4084|  Chapter: How should the masters treat their slaves and expiation if they show high- handedness.  Suwaid b. Muqarrin reported that he had a slave-girl and a person (one of the members  of the family) slapped her, whereupon Suwaid said to him: Don’t you know that it is  forbidden (to strike the) face. He said: You see I was the seventh one amongst my  brothers during the lifetime of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and we had  but only one servant. One of us got enraged and slapped him. Thereupon Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded us to set him free.

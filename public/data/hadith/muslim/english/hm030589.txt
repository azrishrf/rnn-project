3|589|  Chapter: The menstruating woman is permitted to wash the head of her husband, comb  his hair, and her left-over is clean, and one is permitted to recline in her lap and recite  the Qur’an.  Abu Huraira reported: While the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was in  the mosque, he said: O ‘Aisha, get me that garment. She said: I am menstruating. Upon  this he remarked: Your menstruation is not in your hand, and she, therefore, got him  that.

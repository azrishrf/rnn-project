15|4115|  Chapter: The permissibility of buying a mudabbar slave.  Jabir b. ‘Abdullah said that a person among the Ansar declared his slave free after his  death, as he had no other property. This news reached the Apostle of Allah (may peace  be upon him) and he said: Who will buy him from me? And Nu’aim b. al-Nahham bought  him for eight hundred dirhams and he handed them over to him, ‘Amr (one of the  narrators) said: I heard Jabir b. ‘Abdullah as saying: He was a Coptic slave, and he died  in the first year (of the Caliphate of ‘Abdullah b. Zubair).

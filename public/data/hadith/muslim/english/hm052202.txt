5|2202|  Chapter: Concerning one who spends and who withholds.  Saâ€™id b. Abu Burda reported on the authority of his grandfather that the Apostle of Allah  (may peace be upon him) said: Giving of Sadaqa is essential for every Muslim. It was  said (to him): What do you say of him who does not find (the means) to do so? He said:  Let him work with both his hands, thus doing benefit to himself and give Sadaqa. It was  said to him: What about him who does not have (the means) to do so? He said: Then let  him assist the needy, the aggrieved. It was said: What do you say of one who cannot  even do this? He said: Then he should enjoin what is reputable or what is good. He  said: What about him if he cannot do that? He (the Holy Prophet) said: He should then  abstain from evil, for verify that is Sadaqa on his behalf.

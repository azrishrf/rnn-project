7|3152|  Chapter: Eminence of Medina, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) showered  blessings upon it. Its sacredness and unlawfulness of hunting and lopping of trees and  demarcation its precincts.  Nafi’ b. Jubair reported that Marwan b. al-Hakam (Allah be pleased with him) addressed  people and made mention of Mecca and its inhabitants and its sacredness, but he made  no mention of Medina, its inhabitants and its sacredness. Rafi’ b. Khadij called to him  and said: What is this that I hear you making mention of Mecca and its inhabitants and  its sacredness, but you did not make mention of Medina and its inhabitants and its  sacredness, while the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) has also declared  sacred (the area) between its two lava lands (Medina)? And (we have record of this)  with us written on Khaulani parchment. If you like, I can read it out to you. Thereupon  Marwan became silent, and then Said: I too have heard some part of it.

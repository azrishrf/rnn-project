31|6135|  Chapter: The best persons.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: You  would find people like those of mine, the good amongst you in the Days of Ignorance  would be good amongst you in the days of Islam, provided they have an understanding  of it and you will find good amongst people the persons who would be averse to position  of authority until it is thrust upon them, and you will find the worst amongst persons one  who has double face. He comes with one face to them and with the other face to the  others.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

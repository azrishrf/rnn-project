5|2300|  Chapter: Bestowal upon those who are made to incline (to truth).  Saâ€™d reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) bestowed (some  gifts) upon a group of people and I was sitting amongst them. The Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him), however, left a person and he did not give him anything and  he seemed to me the most excellent among them (and thus deserved the gifts more  than anyone else). So I stood up before the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) and said to him in undertone: Messenger of Allah, what about so and so? By Allah,  I find him a believer. He (the Messenger of Allah) said: He may be a Muslim. I kept quiet  for a short while, and then what I knew of him urged me (to plead his case again) and I  said: Messenger of Allah, what about so and so? By Allah, I find him a believer. Upon  this he (the Holy Prophet) said: He maybe a Muslim. I again remained quiet for a short  while, and what I knew of him again urged me (to plead his case so I) said: Messenger  of Allah, what about so and so? By Allah, I find him a believer. Upon this he (the Holy  Prophet) said: He may be a Muslim. I often bestow (something) upon a person, whereas  someone else is dearer to me than he, because of the fear that he may fall heading into  the fire. And in the Hadith transmitted by Hulwani this statement was repeated twice.

5|2214|  Chapter: Exhortation to Sadaqa even though it is half a date, or a good word. for they are  protection against fire.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: O people,  Allah is Good and He therefore, accepts only that which is good. And Allah commanded  the believers as He commanded the Messengers by saying: “O Messengers, eat of the  good things, and do good deeds; verily I am aware of what you do” (xxiii. 51). And He  said: ‘O those who believe, eat of the good things that We gave you” (ii. 172) He then         made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair dishevelled and covered with  dust. He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): “O Lord, O  Lord,” whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful  and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?

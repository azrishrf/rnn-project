24|5209|  Chapter: About the signet ring made of gold.  Abdullah b. ‘Abbas reported that Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw a  person wearing a gold signet ring in his hand. He (the Holy Prophet) pulled it off and  threw it away, saying: One of you is wishing live coal from hell and putting it on his  hand. It was said to the person after Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had  left: Take your signet ring (of gold) and derive benefit out of it, whereupon he said: No,  by Allah, I would never take it when Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has  thrown it away.

23|4889|  Chapter: Forbiddance of wine.  Anas b. Malik reported: I was serving drink to Abu ‘Ubaida b. jarrah, Abu Talha and  Ubayy b. Ka’b prepared from unripe dates and fresh dates when a visitor came and he  said: Verily liquor has been prohibited. Thereupon, Abu Talha said: Anas, stand up and  break this pitcher. I stool up and (took hold) of a pointed stone and struck the pitcher  with its lower part until it broke into pieces.

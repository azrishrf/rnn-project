6|2386|  Chapter: The month may consist of twenty-nine days.  Abu Zubair is reported to have heard Jabir b. â€˜Abdullah (Allah be pleased with both of  them) as saying: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) separated himself from  his wives for a month. (His wives said:) He came to us on the morning of the twenty- ninth. Upon this some, of the people said: It is the morning of twenty-ninth (according to  our calculation). Upon this the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The  month may also consist of twenty-nine days. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon         him) then flapped his bands thrice, twice with all the fingers of both his hand (to indicate  twenty-nine) and by the third time with nine (fingers).

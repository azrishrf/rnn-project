19|4422|  Chapter: The persecution of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) at the hands of the  infidels and hypocrites.  It has been narrated by Abdullah (b. Mas’ud) who said: When the Messenger of Allah  (may peace be upon him) was lying prostrate in prayer and around him were some  people from the Quraish, ‘Uqba b. Abu Mu’ait brought the foetus of a she-camel and  threw it on the back of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He did not  raise his head until Fatima arrived, removed it from his back and cured him who had  done that (ugly act). He said: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the chiefs of the         Quraish. Abu Jahl b. Hisham, ‘Utba b. Rabi’a. Uqba b. Abu Mu’ait, Shaiba b. Rabi’a,  Umayya b. Khalaf or Ubayy b. Khalaf (Shu’ba, one of the narrator of this tradition is in  doubt about the exact person). I saw that all were slain in the Battle of Badr and their  dead bodies were thrown into a well, except that of Umayya or Ubayy which was cut  into pieces and was thrown into the well.

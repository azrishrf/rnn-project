8|3236|  Chapter: One who can support a wife should marry.  Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported that some of the Companions of Allah’s  Apostle (May peace be upon him) asked his (the Prophet’s) wives about the acts that he  performed in private. Someone among them (among his Companions) said: I will not  marry women; someone among them said: I will not eat meat; and someone among  them said: I will not lie down in bed. He (the Holy Prophet) praised Allah and glorified  Him, and said: What has happened to these people that they say so and so, whereas I  observe prayer and sleep too; I observe fast and suspend observing them; I marry  women also? And he who turns away from my Sunnah, he has no relation with me

4|1076|  Chapter: Change of Qibla from Bait-u’l-Manqdis to Ka’ba.  ‘Aisha reported: Umm Habiba and Umm Salama made a mention before the Messenger  of Allah (may peace be upon him) of a church which they had seen in Abyssinia and  which had pictures in it. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: When a  pious person amongst them (among the religious groups) dies they build a place of  worship on his grave, and then decorate it with such pictures. They would be the worst  of creatures on the Day of judgment in the sight of Allah.

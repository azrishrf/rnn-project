31|6051|  Chapter: The merits of Jarir b. ‘Abdullah (Allah be pleased with him).  Jarir reported: Since I embraced Islam Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  never refused to see me and he did not see me but with a smile on his face. Ibn Numair  has made this addition to this hadith which has been reported on the authority of Ibn  Idris that he (Jarir) made this complaint to him (to the Holy Prophet): I cannot sit upon  the horse with firmness, whereupon he (Allah’s Apostle) struck his chest with his hand  and prayed: O Allah, make him steadfast and rightly-guided.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

19|4404|  Chapter: The treaty of Hudaibiya.  It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that the Quraish made peace with the  Prophet (may peace be upon him). Among them was Suhail b. Amr. The Prophet (may  peace be upon him) said to ‘Ali: Write “In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most  Merciful.” Suhail said: As for “Bismillah,” we do not know what is meant by “Bismillah-ir- Rahman-ir-Rahim” (In the name of Allah most Gracious and most Merciful). But write  what we understand, i.e. Bi-ismika allahumma (in thy name. O Allah). Then, the Prophet  (may peace be upon him) said: Write: “From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.”  They said: If we knew that thou welt the Messenger of Allah, we would follow you.  Therefore, write your name and the name of your father. So the Holy Prophet (may  peace be upon him) said: Write “From Muhammad b. ‘Abdullah.” They laid the condition  on the Prophet (may peace be upon him) that anyone who joined them from the  Muslims, the Meccans would not return him, and anyone who joined you (the Muslims)  from them, you would send him back to them. The Companions said: Messenger of  Allah, should we write this? He said: Yes. One who goes away from us to join them-may  Allah keep him away ! and one who comes to join us from them (and is sent back) Allah  will provide him relief and a way of escape.

4|1966|  Chapter: Prayer at the time of solar eclipse.  ‘Aisha reported that there was a solar eclipse in the time of the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him). He stood up to pray and prolonged his stand very much. He then         bowed and prolonged very much his bowing. He then raised his head and prolonged his  stand much, but it was less than the (duration) of the first stand. He then bowed and  prolonged bowing much, but it was less than the duration of his first bowing. He then  prostrated and then stood up and prolonged the stand, but it was less than the first  stand. He then bowed and prolonged his bowing, but it was less than the first bowing.  He then lifted his head and then stood up and prolonged his stand, but it was less than  the first stand. He then bowed and prolonged bowing and it was less than the first  bowing. He then prostrated himself; then he turned about, and the sun had become  bright, and he addressed the people. He praised Allah and landed Him and said: The  sun and the moon are two signs of Allah; they are not eclipsed on account of anyone’s  death or on account of anyone’s birth. So when you see them, glorify and supplicate  Allah, observe prayer, give alms. O Ummah of Muhammad, none is more indignant than  Allah When His servant or maid commits fornication. O people of Muhammad, by Allah,  if you knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little.

4|1541|  Chapter: What is to be recited while entering the mosque.  Abu Qatada, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), said: I  entered the mosque, when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had been  sitting among people, and I also sat down among them. Upon this the Messenger of  Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What prevented you from offering two rak’ahs (of  Nafl prayer) before sitting down? I said: Messenger of Allah, I saw you sitting and  people sitting (around you and I, therefore, sat in your company). He (the Holy Prophet)  then said: When anyone among you enters the mosque, he should not sit till he has  observed two rak’ahs.

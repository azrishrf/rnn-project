30|5852|  Chapter: Pertaining to the merits of Moses (peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said that the  Angel of Death came to Moses and said: Respond (to the call) of Allah (i.e. be prepared  for death). Moses (peace be upon him) gave a blow at the eye of the Angel of Death  and knocked it out. The Angel went back to Allah (the Exalted) and said: You sent me to  your servant who does not like to die and he knocked out my eye. Allah restored his eye  to its proper place (and revived his eyesight) and said: Go to My servant and say: Do  you want life? And in case you want life, keep your hand on the body of the ox and you  would live such number of years as the (number of) hair your hand covers. He (Moses)  said: What, then? He said: Then you would die, whereupon he (Moses) said: Then why  not now? (He then prayed): Allah, cause me to die close to the sacred land. Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Had I been near that place I would have  shown his grave by the side of the path at the red mound. This hadith has been  transmitted on the authority of Ma’mar.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

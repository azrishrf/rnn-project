31|6010|  Chapter: The merits of Umm Sulaim, the mother of Anas b. Malik and Bilal (Allah be pleased  with both of them).  Anas reported that Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) did not enter the house of  any woman except that of his wives and that of Umm Sulaim. He used to visit her. It  was said to him why it was so, whereupon he said: I feel great compassion for her. Her  brother was killed while he was with me.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

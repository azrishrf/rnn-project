22|4858|  Chapter: It was not permissible to eat the flesh of sacrificial animals beyond three days  at the beginning of Islam, but this prohibition was abrogated, and now it is permissible.  Jabir b. Abdullah reported: We did not eat the flesh of our sacrificial animals beyond  three days in Mina. Then Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted us  saying: Eat and make it a provision (for journey). I asked ‘Ata’ whether Jabir had also  said: Till we came to Medina. He said: Yes.

9|3531|  Chapter: There is no maintenance allowance for one who has been given irrevocable  divorce.  Hisham reported on the authority of his father that Yahya b. Sa’id b. al-‘As married the  daughter of ‘Abd al-Rahman b. al-Hakam, and he divorced her and he turned her out  from his house. ‘Urwa (Allah be -pleased with him) criticised this (action) of theirs (the  members of the family of her in-laws). They said: Verily, Fatima too went out (of her in- laws’ house). ‘Urwa said: I came to ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) and told her about  it and she said: There is no good for Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) in  making mention of it.

4|1118|  Chapter: It is forbidden to remove pebbles and smooth the ground while engaged in  prayer.  Abu Saâ€™id al-Khudri reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw  sputum sticking to the Qibla of the mosque. He scratched it off with a pebble and then         forbade spitting on the right side or in front, but (it is permissible) to spit on the left side  or under the left foot.

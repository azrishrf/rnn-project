31|6108|  Chapter: The merits of the settlements of the Ansar).  Abu Usaid Ansar reported: I bear witness to the fact that Allah’s Messenger (may peace  be upon him) said: The best settlements of the Ansar are of those of Banu Najjar, then  of Banu ‘Abu al-Aslihal and then of Banu Harith b. Khazraj, then of Banu Sa’ida and  there is in every settlement of the Ansar good. Abu Salama reported that Abu Usaid  said: Can I tell a Iie about Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? And if I were a  liar, I would have started with my tribe Banu Sa’ida. This was conveyed to Sa’d b.  ‘Ubida and he found (rankling) in his mind and said: We have been left behind (in the  sense) that we have been (mentioned) last of the four. He (Sa’d) said: Saddle my pony  so that I should go to Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). His nephew saw  him and said: Are you going to contradict (the order of) precedence set by Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him), whereas Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) has the best knowledge of it? Is it not sufficient for you that you are the fourth  amongst the four (best tribes of the Ansar)? So he returned and said: Allah and His  Messenger know best, and he commanded that his pony should be unsaddled.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

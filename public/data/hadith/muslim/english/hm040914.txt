4|914|  Chapter: Recitation of the Qur’an loudly in the dawn prayer.  Jabir b. Samura reported: ‘Umar said to Sa’d: They complain against you in every  matter, even in prayer. He (Sa’d) said: I prolong (standing) in the first two (rak’ahs) and  shorten it in the last two, and I make no negligence in following the prayer of the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He (‘Umar) remarked: This is what is  expected of you, or, that is what I deemed of you.

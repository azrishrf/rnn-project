Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who  has observed fast among you today? Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) replied: It is  I. He (the Holy Prophet again) said: Who among you followed the bier today? Abu Bakr  (Allah be pleased with him) replied: It is I. He (the Holy Prophet again) said: Who among  you led a poor man today? Abu Bakr (Allah he pleased with him) replied: It is I. He  (again) said: Who among you visited an invalid today? Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with  him) said: It is I. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:  Anyone in whom (these good deeds) are combined will certainly, enter paradise.

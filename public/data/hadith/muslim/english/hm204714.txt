20|4714|  Chapter: The merit of archery and inducing others to learn it and denunciation of one  who learnt the art and then neglected it.  It has been reported by ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Shamasa that Fuqaim al-Lakhmi said to  Uqba b. Amir: You frequent between these two targets and you are an old man, so you  will be finding it very hard. ‘Uqba said: But for a thing I heard from the Holy Prophet  (may peace be upon him), I would not strain myself. Harith (one of the narrators in the  chain of transmitters) said: I asked Ibn Shamasa: What was that? He said that he (the  Holy Prophet) said: Who learnt archery and then gave it up is not from us or he has  been guilty of disobedience (to Allah’s Apostle).

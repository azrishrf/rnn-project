30|5803|  Chapter: How long did the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) stay in Medina and  Mecca.  Abu Ishaq reported: I was sitting with ‘Abdullah b. ‘Utba and there was a discussion  about the age of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Some of the  persons said: Abu Bakr was older than Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him).  ‘Abdullah said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) died when he was sixty- three, and Abu Bakr died when he was sixty-three and so ‘Umar fell as a martyr when         he was sixty-three. A person from the people who was called ‘Amir b. Sa’d reported that  Jabir had said: We were sitting with Mu’awiya that there was a discussion about the age  of Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Thereupon Mu’awiya said: Allah’s  Messenger (may peace be upon him) died when he had attained the age of sixty-three,  and Abu Bakr died when he had attained the age of sixty-three, and Umar fell as a  martyr when he had attained the age of sixty-three.

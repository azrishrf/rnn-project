19|4417|  Chapter: The battle of Uhud.  It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) had his front teeth damaged on the day of the Battle of Uhud, and got a  wound on his head. He was wiping the blood (from his face) and was saying: How will  these people attain salvation who have wounded their Prophet and broken his tooth  while he called them towards God? At this time, God, the Exalted and Glorious,  revealed the Verse: “Thou hast no authority” (iii. 127).

7|2976|  Chapter: Excellence of flinging pebbles at Jamrat al-Aqaba on the day of sacrifice (10th  of Dhu’l-Hijja) while riding.         Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I saw Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) flinging pebbles while riding his camel on the Day of Nahr, and he was saying:  Learn your rituals (by seeing me performing them), for I do not know whether I would be  performing Hajj after this Hajj of mine.

30|5792|  Chapter: The fact pertaining to the seal of his prophethood, its characteristic feature and its  location on his body.         As-Sa’ib b. Yazid reported: My mother’s sister took me to Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) and said: Allah’s Messenger, here is the son of my sister and he is  ailing. He touched my head and invoked blessings upon me. He then performed  ablution and I drank the water left from his ablution; then I stood behind him and I saw  the seal between his shoulders.

2|474|  Chapter: It is obligatory to wash all parts of the body necessary for purification.  Jabir reported: â€˜Umar b. Khattab said that a person performed ablution and left a small  part equal to the space of a nail (unwashed). The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon  him) saw that and said: Go back and perform ablution well. He then went back  (performed ablution well) and offered the prayer.

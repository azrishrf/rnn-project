3|603|  Chapter: It is permissible for a person to sleep after sexual intercourse (without a bath)  and the desirability of ablution for him, and washing of the sexual organ, as he intends  to eat, drink, or sleep or cohabit.  ‘Abdullah b. Abu’l-Qais reported: I asked ‘Aisha about the Witr (prayer) of the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and made mention of a Hadith, then I  said: What did he do after having sexual intercourse? Did he take a bath before going to  sleep or did he sleep before taking a bath? She said: He did all these. Sometimes he  took a bath and then slept, and sometimes he performed ablution only and went to  sleep. I (the narrator) said: Praise be to Allah Who has made things easy (for human  beings).

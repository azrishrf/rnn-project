17|4192|  Chapter: Prescribed punishment for an adulterer and an adulteress.  ‘Ubada b. as-Samit reported that whenever Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him)  received revelation, he felt its rigour and the complexion of his face changed. One day  revelation descended upon him, he felt the same rigour. When it was over and he felt  relief, he said: Take from me. Verily Allah has ordained a way for them (the women who  commit fornication): (When) a married man (commits adultery) with a married woman,  and an unmarried male with an unmarried woman, then in case of married (persons)  there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to death). And in case  of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile for one year.

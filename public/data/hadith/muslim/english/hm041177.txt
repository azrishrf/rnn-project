4|1177|  Chapter: It is forbidden to cry out for finding out the lost thing in the mosque.  Ibrahim b. Suwaid reported: ‘Alqama led us in the noon prayer and be offered five  rak’ahs; when the prayer was complete, the people said to him: Abu Shibl, you have  offered five rak’ahs. He said: No, I have not done that. They said: Yes (you said five  rak’ahs). He (the narrator) said: And I was sitting in a corner among people and I was  just a boy. I (also) said: Yes, you have offered five (rak’ahs). He said to me: O, one- eyed, do you say the same thing? I said: Yes. Upon this he turned (his face) and  performed two prostrations and then gave salutations, and then reported ‘Abdullah as  saying: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led us in prayer and offered  five rak’ahs. And as he turned away the people began to whisper amongst themselves.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: What is the matter with you? They said: Has the prayer  been extended? He said: No. They said: You have in fact said five rak’ahs. He (the Holy  Prophet) then turned his back (and faced the Qibla) and performed two prostrations and  then gave salutations and further said: Verily I am a human being like you, I forget just  as you forget. Ibn Numair made this addition: “When any one of you forgets, he must  perform two prostrations.”

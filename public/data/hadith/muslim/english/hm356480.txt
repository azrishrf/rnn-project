35|6480|  Chapter: It is not something appreciable to make request for death from the Lord when one is in  trouble.  Anas (b. Malik) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying. None  of you should make a request for death because of the trouble in which he is involved,  but if there is no other help to it, then say: O Allah, keep me alive as long as there is  goodness in life for me and bring death to me when there is goodness in death for me.

2|552|  Chapter: Instructions pertaining to the licking of a dog.  A hadith like this has been narrated from Shu’ba with the same chain of transmitters  except for the fact that in the hadith transmitted by Yahya those words are: “He (the  Holy Prophet) gave concession in the case of the dog for looking after the herd, for  hunting and for watching the cultivated land,” and there is no mention of this addition  (i.e. concession in case of watching the cultivated lands) except in the hadith  transmitted by Yahya.

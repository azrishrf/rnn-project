19|4433|  Chapter: About the Holy Prophet’s (may peace be upon him) calling for Allah’s help and his  patience over the persecution of the hypocrites.  It has been narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that it was said to the Holy  Prophet (may peace be upon him): Would that you approached Abdullah b. Ubayy (to  persuade him to accept Islam). The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him)  (accordingly) went to him, riding a donkey, and (a party of) Muslims also went (with  him). On the way they had to walk over a piece of land affected with salinity. When the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approached him, he said: Do not come near  me. By Allah, the obnoxious smell of your donkey has offended me (As a rejoinder to  this remark), a man from the Ansar said: By God, the smell of the donkey of the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is better than your smell (At this), a man  from the tribe of ‘Abdullah got furious. Then people from both sides got furious and  exchanged blows with sticks, hands and shoes. (The narrator says) that (after this  scuffle) we learnt that (the Qur’anic verse): “It two parties of the Believers have a  quarrel, make ye peace between them” (xlix. 9) was revealed about these fighting  parties.

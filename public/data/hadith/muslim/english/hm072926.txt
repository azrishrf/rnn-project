7|2926|  Chapter: Sa’i between al-Safi’ and at-Marwi is essential rite of Hajj and Hajj is not  complete without it.  ‘Urwa b. Zubair reported: I asked ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her); the rest of the  Hadith is the same. And in this Hadith (these words are also found): “When they (the  Companions of the Holy Prophet) asked Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him)  about this, they said: Messenger of Allah, we felt reluctant to circumambulate between  al-Safa’ and al-Marwa. Then Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse: “Verily  al-Safa’ and al-Marwa are among the Signs of. Allah so he who perform Hajj or Umra it  is no sin on him if he should circumambulate between them. ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased  with her) said: Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) laid down this Sa’i between  them as Sunnah (of the Holy Prophet). So it is not advisable for anyone to abandon this  Sa’i between them.

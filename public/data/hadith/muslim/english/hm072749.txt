7|2749|  Chapter: What is to be done with a Muhrim when he dies.  Sa’id b. Jubair reported on the authority of Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) that a  person proceeded with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the state of  Ihram. The rest of the Hadith is the same except that he (the Holy Prophet) (is reported  to have) said: He would be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing Talbiya.  Sa’id b. Jubair did not name the place where he fell down.

8|3318|  Chapter: The dower.  Abu Salama b. ‘Abd al-Rahman reported: I asked ‘Aisha, the wife of Allah’s Messenger  (May peace be upon him): What is the amount of dower of Allah’s Messenger (May  peace be upon him)? She said: It was twelve ‘uqiyas and one nash. She said: Do you  know what is al-nash? I said: No. She said: It is half of uqiya, and it amounts to five  hundred dirhams, and that was the dower given by Allah’s Messenger (May peace be  upon him) to his wives.

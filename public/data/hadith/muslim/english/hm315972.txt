31|5972|  Chapter: The merits of Hadrat Khadija, mother of the faithful (Allah be pleased with her).  ‘Aisha reported: Never did I feel jealous of the wives of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be  upon him) but in case of Khadija, although I did no, (have the privilege to) see her. She  further added that whenever Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) slaughtered a  sheep, he said: Send it to the companions of Khadija I annoyed him one day and said:  (It is) Khadija only who always prevails upon your mind. Thereupon Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) said: Her love had been nurtured in my heart by Allah  Himself.  HOLY PROPHET (PBUH)

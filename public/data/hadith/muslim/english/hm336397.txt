33|6397|  Chapter: The growth of a child in the womb of a mother and his destiny in regard to his  livelihood, his deeds. both good and evil.  Anas b. Malik reported directly from Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that  he said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has appointed an angel as the caretaker of the  womb, and he would say: My Lord, it is now a drop of semen; my Lord, It is now a clot  of blood; my Lord, it has now become a lump of flesh, and when Allah decides to give it  a final shape, the angel says: My Lord, would it be male or female or would he be an  evil or a good person? What about his livelihood and his age? And it is all written as he  is in the womb of his mother.

25|5366|  Chapter: It is forbidden to peep into the house of another person.  Sahl b. Sa’d as-Sa’id reported that a person peeped through the hole of the door of  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and at that time Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) had with him a scratching instrument with which he had been  scratching his head. When Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw him; he  said: If I were to know that you had been peeping through the door, I would have thrust  that into your eyes, and Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Permission  is needed as a protection against glance.

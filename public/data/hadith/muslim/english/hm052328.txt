5|2328|  Chapter: It is forbidden to pay Zakat to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and  Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib.  ‘Ali said: Whenever I narrate to you anything from the Messenger of Allah (may peace  be upon him) believe it to be absolutely true as falling from the sky is dearer to me than  that of attributing anything to him (the Holy Prophet) which he never said. When I talk to  you of anything which is between me and you (there might creep some error in it) for  battle is an outwitting. I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as  saying: There would arise at the end of the age a people who would be young in age  and immature in thought, but they would talk (in such a manner) as if their words are the  best among the creatures. They would recite the Qur’an, but it would not go beyond  their throats, and they would pass through the religion as an arrow goes through the  prey. So when you meet them, kill them, for in their killing you would get a reward with  Allah on the Day of judgment.

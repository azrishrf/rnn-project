4|1163|  Chapter: It is forbidden to cry out for finding out the lost thing in the mosque.  ‘Abdullah b. Buhaina reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) led us  two rak’ahs of prayer in one of the (obligatory) prayers and then got up and did not sit  and the people stood up along with him. When he finished the prayer and we expected  him to pronounce salutation, he said: “Allah is Most Great” while sitting and made two  prostrations before salutation and then pronounced (the, final) salutation.

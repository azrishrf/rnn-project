4|831|  Chapter: The reciting of Tasmi’ (Allah listens to him who praises Him) Tahmid (O our Lord, for  Thee is the praise), and Timin (Amin).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saying: The Imam is  appointed to be followed. So recite takbir when he recites it, and bow down when he  bows down and when he utters: “Allah listens to him who praises Him,” say “O Allah,  our Lord for Thee be the praise.” And when he prays, standing, you should pray  standing. And when he prays sitting, all of you should pray sitting.

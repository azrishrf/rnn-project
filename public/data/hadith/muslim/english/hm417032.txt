41|7032|  Chapter: The Hadith pertaining to the spy of the Dajjal.  Anas b. Malik reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: There will  be no land which would not be covered by the Dajjal but Mecca and Medina, and there  would no passage out of the passages leading to them which would not be guarded by  angels arranged in rows. Then he (the Dajjal) would appear in a barren place adjacent  to Medina and it would rock three times that every unbeliever and hypocrite would get  out of it towards him.

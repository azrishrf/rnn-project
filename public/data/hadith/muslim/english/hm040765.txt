4|765|  Chapter: The desirability of raising the hands apposite the shoulders at the time of beginning  the prayer and at the time of bowing and at the time of returning to the erect position after  bowing.  Abu Huraira reported: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) got up  for prayer, he would say the takbir (Allah-o-Akbar) when standing, then say the takbir  when bowing, then say: “Allah listened to him who praised him,” when coming to the  erect position after bowing, then say while standing: “To Thee, our Lord, be the praise”,  then recite the takbir when getting down for prostration, then say the takbir on raising  his head, then say the takbir on prostrating himself, then say the takbir on raising his  head. He would do that throughout the whole prayer till he would complete it, and he  would say the takbir when he would get up at the end of two rak’as after adopting the  sitting posture. Abu Huraira said: My prayer has the best resemblance amongst you  with the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).

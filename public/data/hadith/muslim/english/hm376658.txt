37|6658|  Chapter: The words of Allah “The good deeds take away the evil deeds”.  ‘Abdullah reported that a person came to Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and  said: Allah’s Messenger, I sported with a woman in the outskirts of Medina, and I have  committed an offence short of fornication. Here I am (before you), kindly deliver verdict  about me which you deem fit. Unar said: Allah concealed your fault. You had better  conceal it yourself also. Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him), however, gave no  reply to him. The man stood up and went away and Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon  him) sent a person after him to call him and be recited this verse: “And observe prayer  at the ends of the day and in the first hours of the night. Surely, good deeds take away  evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful” (xi. l15). A person amongst the people  said: Allah’s Apostle, does it concern this marn only? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet)  said: No, but the people at large.

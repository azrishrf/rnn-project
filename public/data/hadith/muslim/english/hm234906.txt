23|4906|  Chapter: It is not approved to prepare Nabidh by mixing dry dates and grapes.  Abu Qatada reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do not  prepare Nabidh by mixing nearly ripe and fresh dates and do not prepare Nabidh by  mixing together fresh dates and grapes, but prepare Nabidh out of each (one of them)  separately. Yahya stated that he had met ‘Abdullah b. Abu Qatada and he narrated it on  the authority of his father that Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said this. This  hadith has been narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Abu Kathir through these two  chains of transmitters but with a slight variation of words.

3|620|  Chapter: Bathing after sexual intercourse or seminal emission.  Ibn ‘Abbas reported it on the authority of Maimuna, his mother’s sister, that she said: I  placed water near the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) to take a bath         because of sexual intercourse. He washed the palms of his bands twice or thrice and  then put his hand In the basin and poured water over his private parts and washed them  with his left hand. He then struck his hand against the earth and rubbed it with force and  then performed ablution for the prayer and then poured three handfuls of water on his  head and then washed his whole body after which he moved aside from that place and  washed his feet, and then I brought a towel (so that he may wipe his body). but he  returned it.

Malik reported that he made a demand for the payment of the debt that Ibn Abu  Hadrad owed to him. This hadith is narrated through another chain of transmitters and  (the words are):” He had to get the loan from Abdullah b. Hadrad al-Aslami. He met him  and pressed him for payment. There was an altercation between them, until their voices  became loud. There happened to pass by them Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon  him) and he said: O Ka’b, and pointed out with his hand in such a way as he meant half.  So he got half of what he (Ibn Abu Hadrad) owed to him and remitted the half.”

10|3627|  Chapter: It is forbidden to meet the traders in the way for getting undue advantage.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) as saying: Do not meet the merchant in the way and enter into business  transaction with him, and whoever meets him and buys from him (and in case it is done,  see) that when the owner of (merchandise) comes into the market (and finds that he  has been paid less price) he has the option (to declare the transaction null and void).

30|5673|  Chapter: The finality of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The similitude of  mine and that of the Apostles (before me) is that of a person who constructed a building and he  built it fine and well and the people went round it saying: Never have we seen a building more  imposing than this, but for one brick, and I am that brick (with which you give the finishing touch  to the building).

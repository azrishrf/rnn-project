4|2065|  Chapter: Merit of the funeral prayer and following the bier.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who  offered prayer over the dead, but did not follow the bier, for him is the reward of one  qirat, and he who followed it, for him is the reward of two qirats. It was asked what the  qirats were. He said: The smaller amongst the two is equivalent to Uhud.

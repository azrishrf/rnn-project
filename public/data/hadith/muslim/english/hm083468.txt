8|3468|  Chapter: Advice in regards to woman.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allahâ€™s Apostle (May peace be upon  him) as saying: He who believes in Allah and the Hereafter, if he witnesses any matter  he should talk in good terms about it or keep quiet. Act kindly towards woman, for  woman is created from a rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is its top. If you  attempt to straighten it, you will break it, and if you leave it, its crookedness will remain  there. So act kindly towards women.

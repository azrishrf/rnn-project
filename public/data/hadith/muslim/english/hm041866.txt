4|1866|  Chapter: Excellence of Friday.  Abu Huraira reported Allah Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying: There is an  angel on every door of the mosque recording him first who (conies) first (a the mosque  for Friday prayer). And he [the Prophet] likened him as one who offers a camel as a  sacrifice and then he went on in the descending order till he reached the point at which  the minimum (sacrifice) is that of an egg. And when the Imam sits (on the pulpit) the  sheets are folded and they (the angels) attend to the mention of Allah.

4|918|  Chapter: Recitation in noon and afternoon prayers.  Abdullah b. Sa’id reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) led us in the  morning prayer in Mecca and began Sarat al-Mu’minin (xxiii) but when he came to the  mention of Moses and Aaron (verse. 45) or to the mention of Jesus (verse 50), a cough  got the better of him, and he bowed. ‘Abdullah b. Sa’ib was present there, and in the  Hadith narrated by Abd al-Razzaq (the words are): He cut short (the recitation) and  bowed.

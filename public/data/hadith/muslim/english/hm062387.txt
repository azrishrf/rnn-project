Umm Salama (Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Apostle of Allah (may peace  be upon him) took an oath that he would not go to some of his wives for the whole of the  month. When twenty-nine days bad passed he (the Holy Prophet) went to them in the  morning or in the evening. Upon this it was said to him: Apostle of Allah, you took an  oath that you would not come to us for a month, whereupon he said: The month may  also consist of twenty-nine days.

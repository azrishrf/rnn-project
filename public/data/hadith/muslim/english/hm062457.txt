6|2457|  Chapter: Sexual Intercourse is completely forbidden during the day in the month of Ramadhan.  Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that a person came to the Apostle of  Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, I am undone. He (the  Holy Prophet) said: What has brought about your ruin? He said: I have had intercourse  with my wife during the month of Ramadan. Upon this he (the Holy prophet) said: Can  you find a slave to set him free? He said: NO He (the Holy Prophet again) said: Can you  observe fast for two consecutive months? He said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Can  you provide food to sixty poor people?, He said: No. He then sat down and (in the  meanwhile) there was brought to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) a  basket which contained dates. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Give these (dates) in charity.  He (the man) said: Am I to give to one who is poorer than I? There is no family poorer  than mine between the two lava plains of Medina. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be  upon him) laughed so that his molar teeth became visible and said: Go and give it to  your family to eat.

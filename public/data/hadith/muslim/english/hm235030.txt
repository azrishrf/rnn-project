23|5030|  Chapter: It is repugnant to breathe in a vessel and appreciable to breathe three times outside  the vessel in course of drinking.  Anas reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) breathed three times  (outside the vessel) in the course of a drink and said: It is more thirst-quenching,  healthier and more wholesome. Anas said: So I also breathe three times in the course  of a drink.

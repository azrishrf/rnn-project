7|2999|  Chapter: Regarding one who shaves before offering the sacrifice or offers sacrifice  before throwing (the stones at Jamra).         This Hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Juraij with the same chain of  transmitters. And the narration of Ibn Bakr is like one transmitted by ‘Isa but with this  (variation): “There are not these words in it: To all these three rites (throwing of pebbles  sacrificing of animal and shaving of one’s head).” And so far as the narration of Yahya  al-Umawi (the words are): I got (my head) shaved before I sacrificed the animal, and I  sacrificed the animal before throwing pebbles, and like that.

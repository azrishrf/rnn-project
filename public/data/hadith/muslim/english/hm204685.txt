20|4685|  Chapter: One who fights that the word of Allah is exalted fights in the way of Allah.  It has been narrated (through another chain of transmitters) on the authority of Abu  Musa who said. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was asked which of  the men fights in the way of Allah: (one who fights) for displaying his valour; (a man  who) fights out of his family pride and (a man who) fights for the sake of show, who  amongst these fights in the way of Allah? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) said: Who fights that the word of Allah be exalted fights in the way of Allah.

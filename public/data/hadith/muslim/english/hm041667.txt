4|1667|  Chapter: Exhortation to supplicate and make mention (of Allah) at the end of the night and its  acceptance by the Lord.  ‘Aisha reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came out during the  night and observed prayer in the mosque and some of the people prayed along with  him. When it was morning the people talked about this and so a large number of people  gathered there. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) went out for the  second night, and they (the people) prayed along with him. When it was morning the  people began to talk about it. So the mosque thronged with people on the third night. He  (the Holy Prophet) came out and they prayed along with him. When it was the fourth  night, the mosque was filled to its utmost capacity but the Messenger of Allah (may  peace be upon him) did not come out. Some persons among then cried: “Prayer.” But  the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not come to them till he came out  for the morning prayer. When he had completed the morning prayer, he turned his face  to the people and recited Tashahhud (I bear testimony that there is no god but Allah and  I bear testimony that Muhammad is His Messenger) and then said: Your affair was not         hidden from me in the night, but I was afraid that (my observing prayer continuously)  might make the night prayer obligatory for you and you might be unable to perform it.

6|2580|  Chapter: The fasts observed by the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) besides  Ramadhan.         ‘Aisha, the Mother of the Believers (Allah be pleased with her), reported that the  Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to observe fasts (so continuously)  that we said that he would not break, and did not observe (them) till we said that he  would not fast: and I did not see the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)  completing the fast of a month, but that of Ramadan, and I did not see him fasting more  in any other month than that of Sha’ban.

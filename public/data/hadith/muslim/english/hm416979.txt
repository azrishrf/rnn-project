41|6979|  Chapter: The Last Hour would not come until a person would pass by a grave and wish that he  should have been the occupant of that grave because of this calamity.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Apostle (may peace he upon him) saying: You have heard  about a city the one side of which is in the land and the other is in the sea  (Constantinople). They said: Allah’s Messenger, yes. Thereupon he said: The Last Hour  would not come unless seventy thousand persons from Bani Isra’il would attack it.  When they would land there, they will neither fight with weapons nor would shower  arrows but would only say: “There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest,” that  one side of it would fall. Thaur (one of the narrators) said: I think that he said: The part  by the side of the ocean. Then they would say for the second time: “There is no god but  Allah and Allah is the Greatest” that the second side would also fall, and they would say:  “There is no god but Allah and Allah is the Greatest,” that the gates would be opened for  them and they would enter therein and, they would be collecting spoils of war and  distributing them amongst themselves that a noise would be heard and It would be said:  Verily, Dajjal has come. And thus they would leave everything there and would turn to  him.

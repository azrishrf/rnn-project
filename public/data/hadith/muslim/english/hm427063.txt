42|7063|  Chapter: Not known.  Abu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A servant  says, My wealth. my wealth, but out of his wealth three things are only his: whatever he  eats and makes use of or by means of which he dresses himself and it wears out or he  gives as charity, and this is what he stored for himself (as a reward for the Hereafter),  and what is beyond this (it is of no use to you) because you are to depart and leave it  for other people. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of al-‘Ala’ b. ‘Abd al- Rahman with the same chain of transmitters.

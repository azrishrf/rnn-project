30|5746|  Chapter: The mercy and compassion of Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) for women  and his command to the camel-driver to drive the mount slowly on which they ride.  Anas b. Malik reported that Umm Sulaim was with the wives of Allah’s Apostle (may  peace be upon him) and a camel-driver had been driving (the camels) oil which they  were riding. Thereupon Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Anjasha, drive  slowly, for you are carrying (on the camels) vessels of glass.  (PBUH) AND HIS COMPANIONS

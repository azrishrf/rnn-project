4|1139|  Chapter: It is not advisable to pray wearing a cloth which has designs or markings over  it.  Ibn Atiq reported: Al-Qasim was in the presence of ‘Aisha (Allah be pleased with her)  that I narrated a Hadith and Qasim was a man who committed errors in (pronouncing  words) and his mother was a freed slave-girl. ‘Aisha said to him: What is the matter with  you that you do not narrate as this son of my brother narrated (the ahadith)? Well I  know from where you picked it up. This is how his mother brought him up and how your  mother brought you up. Qasim felt angry (on this remark of Hadrat ‘Aisha) and showed  bitterness towards her. When he saw that the table had been spread for ‘Aisha, he  stood up, ‘Aisha, said: Where are you going? He said: (I am going) to say prayer. She  said: Sit down (to take the food). He said: I must say prayer. She said: Sit down,  faithless, for I have heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: No  prayer can be (rightly said) when the food is there (before the worshipper), or when he  is prompted by the call of nature.

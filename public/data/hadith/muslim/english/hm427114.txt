42|7114|  Chapter: He who associates one as an object of worship with Allah in his Deeds.  Abu Huraira reported Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as stating that Allah  the Most High and Exalted said: I am the One, One Who does not stand in need of a  partner. If anyone does anything in which he associates anyone else with Me, I shall  abandon him with one whom he associates with Allah.

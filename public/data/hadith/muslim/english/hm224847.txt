22|4847|  Chapter: Permissibility of slaughtering the animal with anything which may make its  blood flow except tooth, nail and bone.  Rafi’ b. Khadij reported: While we were with Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon  him) in Dhu’I-Hulaifa in Tihama, we got hold of goats and camels. Some persons  (amongst us) made haste and boiled (the flesh of goats and camels) in their earthen  pots. He then commanded and these were turned over; then he equalised ten goats for  a camel. The rest of the hadith is the same.

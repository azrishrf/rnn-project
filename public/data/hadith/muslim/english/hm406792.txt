40|6792|  Chapter: There is a street in Paradise where the inmates of Paradise would get favour and  grace.  Anas b. Malik reported that Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: In  Paradise there is a street to which they would come every Friday. The north wind will  blow and would scatter fragrance on their faces and on their clothes and would add to  their beauty and loveliness, and then they would go back to their family after having an  added lustre to their beauty and loveliness, and their family would say to them: By Allah,  you have been increased in beauty and loveliness after leaving us, and they would say:  By Allah, you have also increased in beauty and loveliness after us.

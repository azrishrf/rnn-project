40|6797|  Chapter: The description of Paradise and the remembrance of Allah by the inmates morning  and evening.  Hammam b. Munabbih reported: These are some of the ahidith which Abu Huraira  reported from Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and one is this that he is  reported to have said: The (members of the) first group that would be admitted to  Paradise would have their faces as bright as full moon during the night. They would  neither spit nor suffer catarrh, nor void excrement. They would have their utensils and  their combs made of gold and silver and the fuel of their braziers would be aloes and         their sweat would be musk and every one of them would have two spouses (so  beautiful) that the marrow of their shanks would be visible through the flesh. There  would be no dissension amongst them and no enmity in their hearts. Their hearts would  be like one heart, glorifying Allah morning and evening.  INTIMATES

4|1253|  Chapter: What is to be recited between Takbir Tahrima, and recitation of the Qur’an.  Abdullah b. Abu Qatada reported on the authority of his father: While we said our prayer  with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) he heard tumult. (At the end of  the prayer) he (the Holy Prophet) said: What is the matter with you? They said: We  hastened to prayer. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Don’t do that; when you come for  prayer, there should be tranquillity upon you. Pray (along with the Imam) what you can  find and complete what preceded you.

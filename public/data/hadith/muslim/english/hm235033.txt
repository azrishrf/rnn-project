23|5033|  Chapter: It is desirable to circulate water or milk (in an assembly) from the right-hand side of  the one who serves.         Anas reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace he upon him) came to Medina when I  was ten years old and he died when I was twenty years old. My mother exhorted me to  serve him. He (the Holy Prophet) came to our house, and we ruined a flabby goat for  him and mixed it (the milk) with water from the well of the house. Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) drank that. Umar and Abu Bakr on his left side said to him:  Allah’s Messenger, give it to Abu Bakr, but he (the Holy Prophet) gave it to the desert  Arab who was on his right. Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who is  on the right, then he who is on the right.

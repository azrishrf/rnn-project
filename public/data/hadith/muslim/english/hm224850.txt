22|4850|  Chapter: It was not permissible to eat the flesh of sacrificial animals beyond three days  at the beginning of Islam, but this prohibition was abrogated, and now it is permissible.  Abu Ubaid reported: I was with ‘Ali b. Abi Talib on the occasion of the ‘Id day. He started  with the ‘Id prayer before delivering the sermon, and said: Allah’s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) forbade us to eat the flesh of our sacrificial animals beyond three  days.

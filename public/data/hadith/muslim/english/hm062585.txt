Jubair about fasting In Rajab, and we  were then passing through the month of Rajab, whereupon he said: I heard Ibn ‘Abbas  (Allah be pleased with both of them) as saying: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be  upon him) used to observe fast (so continuously) that we (were inclined) to say that he  would not break (them) and did not observe them so continuously) that we (were  inclined to say) that he would not observe fast.

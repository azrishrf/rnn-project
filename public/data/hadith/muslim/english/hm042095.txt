4|2095|  Chapter: Standing up on seeing a bier.  It is narrated on the authority of Jabir Ibn â€˜Abdullah: There passed a bier and the Holy  Prophet (may peace be upon him) stood up for it and we also stood up along with him.  We said: Messenger of Allah, that was the bier of a Jewess. Upon this he remarked:  Verily, death is a matter of consternation, so whenever you come across a bier stand  up.

40|6852|  Chapter: The description of the Day of Resurrection (May Allah save us from its terrors).  Miqdad b. Aswad reported: I heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace he upon him) as  saying: On the Day of Resurrection, the sun would draw so close to the people that  there would be left only a distance of one mile. Sulaim b. Amir said: By Allah, I do not         know whether he meant by “mile” the mile of the (material) earth or on instrument used  for applying collyrium to the eye. (The Holy Prophet is, however, reported to have said):  The people would be submerged in perspiration according to their deeds, some up to  their knees, Some up to the waist and some would have the bridle of perspiration and,  while saying this, Allah’s Apostle (may peace be upon him) pointed his hand towards his  mouth.

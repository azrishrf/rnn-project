9|3590|  Chapter: The right of inheritance of property vests with one who emancipates the slave.         ‘Aisha (Allah’s be pleased with her) reported that she had bought Barira from the people  of Ansar, but they laid down the condition that the right of inheritance (would vest in  them), whereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The right of  inheritance vests with one who shows favour (who emancipates) and Allah’s Messenger  (may peace be upon him) gave her the choice (either to retain) her matrimonial alliance  or break it). Her husband was a slave. She (Barira also) gave ‘Aisha some meat as gift.  Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I wish you could prepare (cook) for  us out of this meat. ‘Aisha said, It has been given as charity to Barira, whereupon he  said: That is charity for her and gift for us.

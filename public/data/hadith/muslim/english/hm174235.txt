17|4235|  Chapter: Imposition of Hadd obliterates sins.  Ubida b. as-Samit reported: While we were in the company of Allahâ€™s Messenger (may  peace be upon him) he said: Swear allegiance to me that you will not associate  anything with Allah, that you will not commit adultery, that you will not steal, that you will  not take any life which it is forbidden by Allah to take but with (legal) justification; and  whoever among you fulfils it, his reward is with Allah and he who commits any such  thing and is punished for it, that will be all atonement for it And if anyone commits  anything and Allah conceals (his favours), his matter rests with Allah. He may forgive if  He likes, and He may punish him if He likes.

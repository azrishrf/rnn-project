After saluting him she said: Abu Abd al-Rahmin, I have decided to leave (Medina)  for the time is hard for us, whereupon Abdullah said to her: Stay here, foolish lady, for I  have heard Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: For one who shows  endurance on the hardships and rigour of it (of Medina) I would be an intercessor or a  witness on his behalf on the Day of Resurrection.

26|5553|  Chapter: Killing of snakes.  ‘Abdullah reported: We were with Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in a  cave when there was revealed to him (the Sura al-Mursalat, i.e. Sura lxxvii.: “By those  sent forth to spread goodness”) and we had just heard (it) from his lips that there  appeared before us a snake. He said: Kill it. We hastened to kill it, but it slipped away  from us, thereupon Allah’s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah saved it  from your harm just as he saved you from its evil.

7|2804|  Chapter: Performing Hajj and Umra separately.  Ja’far b. Muhammad narrated on the authority of his father thus: I came to Jabir b.  Abdullah and asked him about the (Farewell) Pilgrimage of Allah’s Messenger (may         peace be upon him). The rest of the Hadith is the same, but with the addition of this:  “There was one Abu Sayyara among the Arabs, (of pre-Islamic period) who carried  (people from Muzdalifa to Mini). As the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him)  set out from Muzdalifa to al-Mash’ar al-Haram, the Quraish were certain that he would  halt there and that would be his station. But he passed on (without staying) there and  paid no heed to it till he came to ‘Arafat and there he stayed.”

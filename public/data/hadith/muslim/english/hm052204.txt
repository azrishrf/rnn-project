5|2204|  Chapter: Concerning one who spends and who withholds.  Hammam b. Munabbih reported that-this is out of (those ahadith) which Abu Huraira  narrated to us from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). And  he while making a mention of ahadith reported from Allahâ€™s Messenger (may peace be  upon him) said this: Sadaqa is due on every joint of a person, every day the sun rises.  Administering of justice between two men is also a Sadaqa. And assisting a man to ride  upon his beast, or helping him load his luggage upon it, is a Sadaqa; and a good word  is a Sadaqa; and every step that you take towards prayer is a Sadaqa, and removing of  harmful things from the pathway is a Sadaqa.

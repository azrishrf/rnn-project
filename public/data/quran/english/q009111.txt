9|111|Indeed Allah has purchased from the Muslims their lives and their wealth in exchange of Paradise for them; fighting in Allah's cause, slaying and being slain; a true promise incumbent upon His mercy, (mentioned) in the Taurat and the Injeel and the Qurâ€™an; who fulfils His promise better than Allah? Therefore rejoice upon your deal that you have made with Him; and this is the great success.

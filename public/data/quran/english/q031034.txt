31|34|Indeed Allah has the knowledge of the Last Day! And He sends down the rain; and He knows all what is in the mothersâ€™ wombs; and no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow; and no soul knows the place where it will die; indeed Allah is the All Knowing, the Informer. (He may reveal the knowledge to whomever He wills.)

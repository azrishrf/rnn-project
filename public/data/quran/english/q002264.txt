2|264|O People who Believe! Do not invalidate your charity by expressing favour and causing injury â€“ like one who spends his wealth for people to see, and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day; his example is similar to that of a rock covered with dust and hard rain fell on it, leaving it as a bare rock; they shall get no control over (or benefit from) anything they have earned; and Allah does not guide the disbelievers.

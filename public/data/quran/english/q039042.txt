39|42|It is Allah Who gives death* to living beings at the time of their demise, and to those who do not die, during their sleep; so He restrains the soul on which the decree of death has been passed, and leaves the other till the appointed term; indeed in this are signs for people who reflect. (*Death is of 2 types â€“ passing to the next world, and sleeping.)

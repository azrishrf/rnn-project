.10,3
10|3|Indeed your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then as befits His Majesty, established Himself upon the Throne* – He plans all matters; there is no intercessor except after His permission;* such is Allah, your Lord – therefore worship Him; so do you not ponder? (* Of Control over everything.** Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) will be the first to be granted permission to intercede.)

.4,6
4|6|And test the orphans till they are fit to get married (reach full age); then if you find them of proper judgement, hand over their wealth to them; and do not devour it by spending excessively and hastily, fearing that they will grow up; and whoever is not in need must abstain; and whoever is needy may use from it in a reasonable measure; and when you hand over their wealth to them, get witnesses over them; and Allah is Sufficient to take account.

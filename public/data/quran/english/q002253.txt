2|253|These are the Noble Messengers, to whom We gave excellence over each other; of them are some with whom Allah spoke, and some whom He exalted high above all others; and We gave Eisa (Jesus), the son of Maryam, clear signs and We aided him with the Holy Spirit; and if Allah willed, those after them would not have fought each other after the clear evidences had come to them, but they differed â€“ some remained on faith and some turned disbelievers; and had Allah willed, they would not have fought each other; but Allah may do as He wills.

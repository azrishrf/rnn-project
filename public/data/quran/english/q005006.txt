5|6|O People who Believe! When you wish to stand up for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and pass wet palms over your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles; and if you need a bath, clean yourselves thoroughly; and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you returns from answering the call of nature, or you have cohabited with women, and you do not find water, then cleanse (yourself) with clean soil â€“ therefore stroke your soiled palms over your faces and your hands with it; Allah does not will to place you in hardship, but He wills to fully purify you and complete His favour upon you, so that you may be grateful.

58|11|O People who Believe! When you are told to give room in the assemblies, then do give room – Allah will give you room (in His mercy); and when it is said, “Stand up in reverence”, then do stand up – Allah will raise the believers among you, and those given knowledge, to high ranks; and Allah is Aware of your deeds.

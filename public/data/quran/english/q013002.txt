13|2|It is Allah Who raised up the heavens without columns for you to observe, then (in the manner befitting His Majesty) established Himself upon the Throne (of control), then subjected the sun and the moon; each one runs for up to an appointed term; Allah plans the works and explain the signs in detail, so that you may believe in meeting with your Lord.

6|93|Who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies against Allah or says, “I have received divine inspiration”, whereas he has not been inspired at all – and one who says, “I will now reveal something similar to what Allah has sent down”? And if you see when the unjust are in the throes of death and the angels are with their hands outstretched; (saying) “Surrender your souls; this day you shall be given a disgraceful punishment – the recompense of your fabricating lies against Allah, and your scorning His signs.”

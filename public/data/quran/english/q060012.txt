60|12|O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)! If Muslim women come humbly to you to take oath of allegiance that they will neither ascribe any partner to Allah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor bring the lie that they carry between their hands and feet, nor disobey you in any rightful matter – then accept their allegiance and seek forgiveness from Allah for them; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.

22|18|Did you not see that for Allah prostrate those who are in the heavens and in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the hills, and the trees, and the beasts, and many among mankind; and there are many upon whom the punishment has been decreed; and he whom Allah disgraces â€“ there is none to give him honour; indeed Allah may do whatever He wills. (Command of Prostration # 6)

5|89|Allah does not take you to task for oaths which are made unintentionally but He does take you to task for oaths which you ratify; so the redemption of such oaths is to provide food to ten needy persons equal to the average of what you feed your family, or to clothe them, or to free one slave; and for one who has no means, is the fasting for three days; this is the redemption of your oaths when you have sworn; and fulfil your oaths; this is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may be thankful.

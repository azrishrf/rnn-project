14|4|And We sent every Noble Messenger with the same language as his people*, so that he may clearly explain to them; then Allah sends astray whomever He wills, and He guides whomever He wills; and He only is the Most Honourable, the Wise. (* Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) was taught all the languages as he is sent towards all.)

66|8|O People who Believe! Incline towards Allah in a repentance that becomes a guidance for the future; it is likely that your Lord will relieve you of your sins and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow – on the day when Allah will not humble the Prophet and the believers along with him; their light will be running ahead of them and on their right; they will say, “Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us; indeed You are Able to do all things.”

61|14|O People who Believe! Become the aides of Allah’s religion, the way Eisa the son of Maryam had said to the disciples, “Who will help me, inclining towards Allah?” The disciples said, “We are the aides of Allah’s religion” – so a group among the Descendants of Israel accepted faith and another group disbelieved; We therefore aided the believers against their enemies, so they were victorious.

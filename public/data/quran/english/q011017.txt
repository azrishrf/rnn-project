11|17|So is the one who is upon the clear proof* from his Lord, and comes a witness upon it from Allah, and before it the Book of Moosa, a leader and a mercy; they accept faith in it; and whoever denies it from all the groups, then the fire is promised for him; so O listener, do not have any doubt concerning it; indeed it is the truth from your Lord; but most people do not believe. (* The Jews who accepted faith in the Qurâ€™an.)

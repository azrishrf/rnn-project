5|95|O People who Believe! Do not kill prey while you are on the pilgrimage; and whoever among you kills it intentionally, so its recompense is that he shall give a similar domestic animal (for sacrifice), two honest men among you rendering the command, the sacrifice being brought to the Kaa’bah – or he gives as redemption, food for some needy persons, or fasts for the same number of days, so that he may taste the consequences of his deed; Allah has forgiven what has passed; and henceforth whoever does it, Allah will take recompense from him; and Allah is Almighty, Avenger.

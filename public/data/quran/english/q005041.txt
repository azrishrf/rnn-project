5|41|O Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)! Do not let yourself be aggrieved by the people who rush towards disbelief – those who say with their mouths, “We believe” but whose hearts are not Muslims; and some Jews; they listen a great deal to falsehood, and to other people who do not come to you; shifting Allah’s Words from their correct places; and say, “If this command is given to you, obey it, but if this is not given to you, then refrain”; and the one whom Allah wills to send astray, you will never be able to help him in the least against Allah; they are those whose hearts Allah did not will to cleanse; for them is disgrace in this world, and for them is a great punishment in the Hereafter.

2|260|And when Ibrahim said, “My Lord! Show me how You will give life to the dead”; He said, “Are you not certain (of it)?” Ibrahim said, “Surely yes, why not? But because I wish to put my heart at ease”; He said, “Therefore take four birds (as pets) and cause them to become familiar to you, then place a part of each of them on separate hills, then call them – they will come running towards you; and know well that Allah is Almighty, Wise.” (Prophet Ibrahim called the dead birds and they did come running towards him.)

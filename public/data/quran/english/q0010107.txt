10|107|“And if Allah afflicts you with some suffering, there is none who can remove it except Him; and if He wills good for you, there is none who can repel His munificence; He bestows it upon whomever He wills from among His bondmen; He is the Oft Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” (* Help, cure, monetary aid etc., whatever benefit derived from any source, reaches us because Allah has given the source this power and is actually through the grace and mercy of Allah.)

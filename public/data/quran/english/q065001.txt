65|1|O dear Prophet (Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him)! When you people divorce women, divorce them at the time of their completing the appointed period, and keep count of the appointed period; and fear Allah, your Lord; do not expel them from their houses during the appointed period nor should they leave on their own, unless they bring about some matter of blatant lewdness; and these are the limits of Allah; and whoever crosses Allah’s limits has indeed wronged himself; do you not know, it is likely that Allah may send some new decree after this?

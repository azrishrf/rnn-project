5|5|This day the pure things are made lawful for you; and the food of the People given the Book(s) is lawful for you – and your food is lawful for them – and likewise are the virtuous Muslim women and the virtuous women from the people who received the Book(s) before you when you give them their bridal money – marrying them, not committing adultery nor as mistresses; and whoever turns a disbeliever after being a Muslim, all his deeds are wasted and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter.

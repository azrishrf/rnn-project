3|179|Allah will not leave you, O People who Believe (the Muslims) in your present state, till He separates the evil from the good; and it does not befit Allah’s Majesty to give you, the common men, knowledge of the hidden, but Allah does chose from His Noble Messengers whomever He wills; so believe in Allah and His Noble Messengers; and if you believe and practice piety, for you is a great reward. (Allah gave the knowledge of the hidden to the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him.)

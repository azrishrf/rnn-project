24|61|There is no restriction upon the blind nor any restraint upon the lame nor any constraint upon the sick nor on any among you if you eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers’ brothers, or the houses of your fathers’ sisters, or the houses of your mothers’ brothers, or the houses of your mothers’ sisters, or from the houses you are entrusted the keys of, or from the house of a friend – there is no blame upon you if you eat together or apart; therefore when you enter the houses, say greetings to your people – the excellent prayer at the time of meeting, from Allah, blessed and pure; this is how Allah explains the verses to you in order that you may understand.

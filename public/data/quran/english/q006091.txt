6|91|And they (the Jews) did not realise (or appreciate) the importance of Allah as was required when they said, “Allah has not sent down anything upon any human being”; say, “Who has sent down the Book which Moosa brought, a light and guidance for mankind, which you have divided into different papers, some which you show and hide most of them? And (by which) you are taught what you did not know nor did your forefathers?” Say, “Allah” – then leave them playing in their indecency.

6|145|Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “I do not find in what is sent down to me any eatable prohibited to a consumer, except if it is carrion, or blood flowing from blood vessels, or the flesh of swine – for that is indeed foul, or the sin causing animal over which the name of any other than Allah is taken at the time of slaughtering; so for one compelled by circumstances, neither himself desiring nor eating more than necessary, indeed your Lord is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.”

4|43|O People who Believe! Do not approach the prayer when you are intoxicated until you have the sense to understand what you say, nor in the state of impurity until you have bathed except while travelling; and if you are ill or on a journey or one of you returns from answering the call of nature or you have cohabited with women, and you do not find water, then cleanse (yourself) with clean soil â€“ therefore stroke your faces and your hands with it; indeed Allah is Most Pardoning, Oft Forgiving.

2|246|Did you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) not see a group of the Descendants of Israel, after Moosa? When they said to one of their Prophets (Shamueel – Samuel), “Appoint a king for us so that we may fight in Allah’s way”? He said, “Do you think you would refrain from fighting if it is made obligatory for you?” They said, “What is the matter with us that we should not fight in Allah’s cause, whereas we have been driven away from our homeland and our children?” So when fighting was ordained for them, they all turned away, except a few; and Allah is Well Aware of the unjust.
